Really worth a read, but tidbits:

> For the 1st time in a modern conflict, the regular forces of Russia are communicating without digital mode, making them fully audible by everyone. 

[...]

> Using publicly available web radio receiveir (webSDR), callsigns of Russian military units and roles were discovered. Reports of losses, injuries, ... everything can be heard. Even them swearing at their own crew, such as in this recording.

[...]

> Because unsecured communications, the frequencies have been constantly jammed by civilians, sometimes in the middle of fights, making the ground infantry unable to operate properly and having to withdraw.

> An entire community created itself around those communications, currently scanning and recording anything of interest, including ShadowBreak. Creating hours of intense Russian army chatter recordings, each demonstrating an army unprepared for such situation.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov sent a letter to the president of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) on Monday. 

He asked ICANN to revoke — either permanently or temporarily — the domains .ru and .su.

He also asked the corporation to shut down the root servers in Moscow and St Petersburg that match domain names and numbers.

In making his request, Mr Fedorov cited the “atrocious crimes” of Russia’s invasion.

He said those crimes “have been made possible mainly due to the Russian propaganda machinery” and said Russian cyberattacks had impeded the ability of Ukrainians and their government to communicate.

ICANN had no immediate comment.

But the regional internet naming authority for Europe and the former Soviet Union, RIPE NCC, rejected the request.

Some excerpts:
>Russia is restoring its unity; the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together – in its entirety of Great Russians, BELARUSIANS and Little Russians.

So, 

1.Russian's real goal is (as expected) to expand their influence


2.Belarus, your leader has sold you out to Putin

3.""great russians"" and ""little russians"" sounds like some sort of caste system (or maybe he means adults and children, idk)





>Now this problem is gone – Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state as a part of the Russian world 

Is a long way of putting ""we'll install a puppet government""

> Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) – but not on its terms and not according to its rules.

He had spent a decade as an investment manager with/for many of the oligarchs in Russia. He has had several encounters with Putin.

Around a decade ago, he had come forward with information regarding serious corruption within some of the largest energy firms in Russia. His attorney was detained and tortured for nearly a year before being killed.

Browder states that Putin's true agenda, like any dictator, is to maintain power. That is always priority one. With the civilian uprisings in recent years of neighboring nations like Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the writing has been on the wall. The fear of any dictator will be encroachment of western ideals and values. 

The dictator playbook is pretty simple: control the media, control the citizens, remain in power. In Browder's opinion, Putin could see the writing on the wall with these outside uprisings and needed to stage a war under the guise of liberating the Ukrainian people. It is why these young soldiers are messaging their mothers, completely confused. They expected to welcomed with open arms.

Control the media in your country, control perception, gain support. Browder also goes on to mention sanctions. Putin couldn't care less about sanctions that affect the people of Russia. What Putin cares about is power and wealth. By hitting the oligarchs (who his assets are tied to), you hurt Putin.

433524585314975a91981fae2a576268,t4hpsd,hyyv974,"Just got out of a seminar with an academic who was highly involved in Eastern European policy in a NATO country over the last 20 years. Some thoughts they had.

- Ukraine, on a tactical level, is not going to win this war. Ukraine is just not a defensible country. It's flat on an open plain to the north and east, and it's bisected by a major river. Despite the bravery of Ukranian forces, they are going to have trouble withdrawing from the east. Furthermore, Russia is just going to get more violent from here.

- That said, Ukraine's military performance has been shocking good, and Russia's shockingly bad. The fact that Ukriane has managed to hold out as long as they have, and potentially even for weeks into the future, has basically set Russia's foreign policy strategy on fire. Even if Russia wins militarily, they have already lost diplomatically and politically. 

- Russia's biggest challenge will be twofold. First, they need to decide if they are going to stop at Kyiv or advance West. Second is how long they are willing to sustain an occupation with an insurgency. 

- Overall, very optimistic about how the post WW2 geopolitical order is holding up. China is still China but Beijing is absolutely having second thoughts about Russia as a partner, and about whether there really is a new global ""multipolar"" order. Russia is certainly not a global power to be reckoned with outside of containment and de-escalation at this point. Putin may have thought it was the right time to break apart the Western alliance with aggressive confrontation, but instead he's shown that they are all still on the same page. What work Putin/Jingping have done to break down the post-Cold War order has been mostly undone overnight.

- The EU, which was previously a total non-factor in geopolitics, has emerged as a leader in this conflict. The results of that can't be overstated. Germany is increasing military spending, Switzerland is joining sanctions, and the EU itself is organizing armaments shipments. Possibly the most significant development of this conflict will be the acceleration of European federalism and the EU's ability to exercise a sphere of influence and a unified foreign policy. The EU may very well accelerate expansion as a way to consolidate their influence. 

- A huge part of that is sanctions. The sanctions leveled against Russia are severe and it cannot be overstated how devastating they are. Putin has been preparing for sanctions but has not prepared for these. Kicking them out of SWIFT is good, but the real kicker is the blocking sanctions on the Russian central bank. Without those funds, Russia is unable to engage in any sort of monetary or fiscal policy which would be really useful to get around the other parts of the sanctions. Japan's participation has been key here. Right now the Kremlin is scrambling to amass physical gold to stave off catastrophe but the situation is not tenable long term, or even medium term. Months is the timeline until things get bad.

- For those wondering, sanctioning countries have temporarily licensed Russian energy sales. If they revoke these licenses and include energy in sanctions things will go south for Russia very quickly. Same if China also puts blocking sanctions on Moscow, which is a longshot, but a possible crushing blow if Beijing can be persuaded.

- There are two international legal steps going on right now. First, Ukriane has asked the ICJ to investigate claims of genocide in the Donbass. This is just going to serve as a formal international legal decision that Russia made up their pretext for war. The second is that although Russia is not a party to the ICC, the ICC does have jurisdiction (in the ways that matter) over actions committed on Ukrainian territory. A likely outcome of all this is that Putin will be declared a war criminal, and any ICC party country will be obligated to arrest him if he ever enters their nation.

- Ukraine's EU membership is likely to be accepted, assuming Zelenskyy's goverment can hold on for years. It's symbolic, because the EU is much more about technical and regulatory alignment, and while it would be a powerful symbol it's not something that can happen overnight. Ukraine will likely get candidate status, and the EU will probably move as fast as they can, but even the fast track is like 2028. 

- What will probably happen quickly is a rush of NATO-periphery countries will join. Finland and Sweden come to mind. Russia has basically laid down the rule that if you are not in NATO, Russia can and will invade with no attempt at diplomacy and that is not a precedent anyone wants to be a part of.

- Putin has got himself on a highway with no off-ramp. At some point NATO needs to offer him a way out of this but it's hard to imagine what that looks like while the campaign is escalating. Russia is just prolonging this process with their own incompetence.",1646172475.0,1646172208.0,t3_t4hpsd,t3_t4hpsd,,0,99,0,99,1,0,

So, I have been poking around about the mercenaries in Ukraine, specifically former SOF. There's a good background article[^1](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3nqb5/ukraine-war-foreign-fighters) on this issue you should all check out.

If you all remember, Zelensky called for a mandatory curfew [^2](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60539122). The reason why was due to the fact that there were assassins sent out to kill him and other government officials as well as his own family.[^3](https://intelnews.org/2022/02/25/01-3159/) This is not the first time this has happened. Back in September, there was an assassination attempt on one of Zelensky's aides.[^4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/12/24/what-we-know-about-remote-control-assassination-attempt-in-ukraine/?sh=20a81624c3fd)

So, back to the mercenaries. There's a sizeable group in Kyiv right now from the United States, France, and UK[^5](https://www.instagram.com/p/CahBNC-sK5y/). I have been trying to find out if there are any former JTF2 members in the group, but it seems like there aren't any at the moment. Why is this interesting? Because they are made up of former SEALS, Green Berets, 75th Rangers, SAS, SBS, SASR. If you scroll through that guy's profile, you can see various patches denoting these kinds of connections. There are even some in Kherson right now. [^6](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/t2ry59) Some of them come from the company known as the Forward Observations Group.

Now, obviously, they aren't going to give away any details of their assignments or roles in Ukraine. But one thing they do very well is ambushing and forward observation. Indeed, Russians are getting first-hand experience of what that kind of military training, skill, and intelligence is like when they were confronted by foreign attackers.[^7](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/t2qg90/russian_invaders_tell_with_horror_how_ukrainians/)

What does this have to do with Zelensky's curfew mandate? Well, it appears that one of the reasons for implementing the curfew was to snuff out any saboteurs.[^8](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-saboteurs-spark-suspicion-solidarity-in-ukraine-kyiv/) It would not surprise me if the other reason was to utilize these SOF to isolate and hunt down assassins using the western mercenaries, including the one linked on Instagram. These guys are there to hunt, as they have fought against them in the past[^9](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html). They aren't there to just play war.

Turkey has been pushed away from the West and naturally went looking the other for allies. Although the country has an unfriendly history with Russia, it's economy has become too dependent on Russia.

Already running out of momentum and supplies, low on morale, and resorting to blatant, disgusting war crimes to try to break the defenders, who show no signs of buckling. How long can they keep this up? Especially when their economy is about to implode.

Dark days are still ahead for Ukraine, certainly, but I'm now 100% confident they will win in the end. In a sense, they already have; look no further than the footage of unarmed civilians turning back tanks if you want proof. There's simply no way to occupy an entire country when millions of people are united against you, with support of the entire free world.

I hate that so many innocent people are being put through this horrific bullshit, but I'm in awe of the ferocity with which the Ukrainians have stood up to defend their homes, and proud of the civilized world for how hard and fast we have moved to support Ukraine, isolate Putin's corrupt regime, and condemn his atrocities.",False,1646171832.0,t3_t4hpsd,t3_t4hpsd,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

Daria Kaleniuk, Executive Director of the ""Anti-Corruption Action Centre"" interview with Sky News

""In a day or two **MILLIONS** and  **MILLIONS** of Ukrainians will have no access to food, access to medicine, will have no access to fuel. So we will be in isolation and it will be the genocide against Ukrainian people and the entire world will simply observe and will be thinking like these ""experts"" from London will be saying, 'let's think what else can we give to Putin?' 

I think the West has to stop thinking 'what else can we give to Putin. The West has to start thinking how to punish Putin and how to actually have strength to stand up and adhere to its promises."" 

[She goes on to say that was what her point to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.]

""...That Ukraine had nuclear weapons and gave them up with the promise from the U.S., UK and Russia; for the assurances that if anyone attacks us there will be a response and there will be help.

And now the U.K. is saying, 'we are not even willing to shut[down] all these missiles. We are not willing to help to protect your side[sic]. I think it's humiliating and it's a hypocrisy.""

The Reporter:  ""But what they are doing is, supplying weapons, they are imposing some of the toughest sanctions and Boris Johnson's point about the 'No Fly Zone', I mean, it could easily lead to clashes with the Russian Air Force, and who knows where that could lead in terms of a much broader war.""

Then she lays out the truth:

""Listen, I already heard this argument, a couple of weeks and a couple of months ago. That 'we are not [going to] imposing sanctions to Russia, we are not stopping Nordstream 2, because it will irritate Russia, let's give up something to Putin, let him operate, let's give him money, let's take some money from him, let's let his oligarchs who are actually war criminals to park their ""Essense"" in our luxurious mansions in Great Britain or in French Riviera. But this **led** us to the most devastating war Europe [has] had since the last 70 years. And you think that this continuous appeasement of Putin and afraidness to irritated him will prevent World War 3? Or prevent nuclear strikes? And I will say[to] you something, Ukraine has four nuclear power plants across the country. And any missile any time from Russia could hit these nuclear power plants; and this will be no more just the Ukrainian territory, it will be up in the air, flying, across entire world and first of all to Europe, to NATO states. And I am now appealing to NATO, that any missile from Russia can hit Ukrainian nuclear power plants and blow up radiation on innocent people across Europe. So NATO has to stand up and hit at least missiles. I'm not talking to hit planes, I'm talking that there has to be, immediately, invented alternative instrument to 'No Fly Zone', which has to protect Ukrainian sky. And that's FULL STOP.

Reporter: Do you think an attack on Kyiv is inevitable nowhere?

""It's happening, c'mon! What type of--what is the question? The attack on Kyiv is already happening. Their missile from Russia was trying to target the damm on Dnieper River. Ukrainian army destroyed that missile. But next time, Ukrainian army will fail to do so, and there will be water flood, killing 1 million Ukrainian people. C'mon, WAKE UP!

Citizens of Russia, we implore you from countries all around the world to understand that your media has been compromised and censored.  
  
Please, we beg you, understand that Ukraine did not start the war with your country.  
  
Your president ordered your troops to invade and occupy Ukraine.  
  
He has been committing war crimes daily. Bombing and executing innocent civilians.  
  
Children and families are being killed every day.  
  
We did not provoke this war. Your soldiers were sent to invade and die unprepared, thinking they were sent for training exercises.  
  
Your young people suffer and die needlessly. Nobody wants this war except Putin and your government for their personal gain. They are sacrificing your young soldiers by the thousands so that they can gain more power.  
  
There is evidence, photos and videos circulating all over the world. Search for reliable sources and you’ll easily find them such as reddit and European media. Use VPN providers to find the evidence uncensored. To see the truth that your government won’t show you.

Before invading, Pootin thought Ukraine will roll over quickly and Zelenskyy government will run away, RU will declare victory and install a puppet in Kyiv, while  Zelenskyy sets up an exile gov in Lviv. 

But, due to  early warnings and planning + Western intelligence + weapons, Ukraine were armed to the teeth and havent yet rolled over, infact have complete upper hand over RU in all land combat. Russia's original plan is virtually impossible at this point of quickly capturing Kyiv without a big fight involving land troops. 

Russian army is ill prepared for a land invasion. Its already March, winter is over, Ru element of surprise is gone, Ukraine have been armed even more in the last week. Russian troops have low morale, terrible comms and are utterly unprepared, a bunch of kids driving tanks who would rather run away than be fighting a war they want nothing to do with. All Russia can do is take the border regions like Donbas. This is a massive embarrassment for Russia and Putin domestically.  His goal was to show a victory to improve his sinking domestic reputation, now a defeat is unfathomable, yet a goal towards victory doesnt exist. 

When RU entered Ukraine, he didnt actually want to kill civilians. It was supposed to be a quick get in get out job, similar to Crimea. Now it has turned into a massive clusterfuck beyond anything Russia had planned for, and worse there is no way out that can be used to save Putin's face. Russia has an extensive air force that has not even been deployed in this war. We have just seen glimpses of Russian bombers. These units have levelled Syria, no reason they cant atleast try to do the same in ukraine.. except they havent even been used much. Russian troops dont even seem to have basic military communication equipment. Many of them are from Eastern Russia, far away from Moscow. Not even sure there is fuel reserves and definitely no logistics support for land army. 

Meanwhile domestically sanctions have crippled everyone's lives. Instead of a quick in and out victory, now everyone is aware Putin ordered his troops to wage war against Slavic neighbours. Local population angry due to the war + crashing markets + cant use google pay, cant buy adidas, or iphone, cant fly anywhere. 

This has to be one of the most embarrassing military events in history. A clusterfuck of epic proportions. 

There is just no way out except accepting Putin defeat and calling the forces back, but big ego wont allow him to. So he has to hit couple of civilian big targets to make a point, but accomplishes nothing. No close to taking over kyiv than from 3 days ago.

For a start no one uses [open source Scada systems](https://rapidscada.org/) in those industries but if I wanted to fake an intrusion I might install one of these and take screenshots of me with root access etc. The screen shots show one of these such systems.

There was some data dumps from a previous hack which Twitter users have found to have come from a website full of public tender documents.

likewise the satellite hack is another [opensource project](https://wso2.com/integration/). This could very easily be faked. ~~The screenshots claim the server has been up since 2021 but the copywrite notice on the login page says 2022. How did they upgrade it without a service reboot.~~
Edit: as many people have pointed out this isn't a major issue. That said I think the fact that this is a screen shot of root access to an opensource platform showing zero customisation and publically known details about IP space for a particular ASN with no other third party validation makes it extremely easy to fake.

If Putin really is scared of nuclear war, and the threat of russia being involved in nuclear war is enough to dissuade him from acting, then NATO explaining in no-uncertain terms that any continued agression towards Ukraine will be viewed as a hostile attack on NATO itself - this should be able to dissuade Putin from acting.

If your response is, 'no that will get us all nuked,' then you need to realize that Putin is no longer deterred by nuclear threat.

If he is willing to risk direct conflict with NATO (a conflict that he cannot win) so he can destory Ukraine then he has no fear of nuclear escalation. If this indeed is the case, the situation is far more grave.

Putin has been pushing since 2000. Polonum, Novachuk, Georgia, Ukraine, Aleppo, cyber attacks, windows, disinfo, elections, bounties on troops, etc. Each of these was met with a stronger response, yet he continues to escalate - now to the point of indiscriminate shelling of civillians in cities like he did in Grozney and Syria.

Appeasement does not work.

In 2015 Turkey shot down a Russian SU-24 for violating its airspace. 

Turkey is a NATO member.

Is the situation then comparable to what it is now? Of course not, because we’re dealing with a full blown invasion of a sovereign country. 

But I think there’s an argument to be had whether or not Putin is actually stupid enough to retaliate with nuclear weapons if a few of his jets are shot down for terrorizing innocent civilians.

The establishment of a “limited” no-fly zone/safe corridor for refugees in the West I’m sure is something the Western nations are discussing but won’t necessarily announce to the world.

Ukraine has a massive natural gas reserve and Russia wants it. That's the only reason they are invading. They don't give a shit about Ukraine, just whats underneath it. If that country turns to rubble, it's doesn't matter to them, as long as that natural gas reserve is okay. That's why they aren't giving up and that's why they are afraid of Ukraine becoming a NATO country, because then Europe won't rely on them anymore for gas, because we'll have that gas reserve. It's always been about the resources. It's always been about Russia wanting the world to rely on them, because that's the only way they'll be a superpower again.

>August 1914 is the first and best known of the four Nodes that constitute The Red Wheel. By concentrating on a couple of crucial weeks at the beginning of the First World War, Solzhenitsyn highlights the underlying sclerosis and vulnerability of a Russian old regime whose stability was erroneously taken for granted by revolutionaries and reactionaries alike. In fact, the regime’s ignorance and incompetence reared its head at the Battle of Tannenberg in East Prussia, a great military confrontation between the Russian 1st and 2nd armies and the German 8th Army that took place between August 17 and September 1, 1914.  Tannenberg was a catastrophic defeat—over a hundred thousand Russian troops were killed or captured—that was a portent of disasters to come. Much of August 1914 is dedicated to describing the mistakes, misjudgments, and false assumptions that culminated in Russian defeat at Tannenberg.

I'm not saying *everyone* who does that is a propagandist, of course (I mean, the propaganda wouldn't be effective if it didn't play on people's fears and convince them to take up a particular position) but they're out there.

Remember, Russians are propaganda experts. They've run an entire country on it.",1646173910.0,1646173530.0,t3_t4hpsd,t1_hyyy7mh,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

This is my concern about all of the untrained civilians showing up in Ukraine to volunteer. 

If you haven’t had at least some training, you can end up being more of a liability than an asset because the Ukrainians want to keep you from being captured. If you get captured by the Russians, which can happen very easily to people unprepared for the reality of a battlefield, you’ve just given Russia a nice fat bargaining chip. 

Legally, Americans and most Europeans who join a foreign army are left to their own fate. However that doesn’t always play well politically. Imagine a video with 1000 scared, crying American teenagers and found out it’s nothing like call of duty. Putin says “You can have them back IF [*small concession to sanctions*]”.

For Putin?

He gets a magic do-over and doesn't invade Ukraine last Wednesday.

He fucked up.

If Russia takes Kyiv tomorrow and kills Zelensky, the war will keep raging, maybe hotter, and continue costing them billions they do not have each day.

They can't sustain an occupation, and a puppet government will not have the support or strength to hold Ukraine without Russian military forces.

And if they don't take Kyiv tomorrow... Most of Russia's tanks are collecting dust in storage and need months of maintenance to get online. Most of Russia's long range missiles are spent, and making more will take months and cost billions.

Putin thought Ukraine would welcome him. He does not believe that people actually want democracy.

He miscalculated, and the decision to openly publish our intelligence documents and analysis like that was especially shocking. It forced him to shift strategy and strike faster, and that caused logistical failures.

Combined with the uniquely unified international response, the net effect for him is already deeply in the red, and I don't just mean the Russian economy.

3) He didn't have hindsight. We say this now about any attempt at diplomacy but he couldn't know it would spread to Poland. It also isn't fait accompli because Hitler did it once that everyone will do it.

 >On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale military invasion of Ukraine, one of its neighbours to the southwest, marking an escalation to a conflict that began in 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity in 2014, Russia had annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces had seized part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, leading to an eight-year war in the region. Some reports called the invasion the largest conventional military attack in Europe since World War II. Starting early in 2021, Russia built up its military around Ukraine's borders with Russia and Belarus.

In June 2018, Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States reported that Ortega had engaged in a violent oppression campaign against protesters in response to the anti-Ortega 2018–2021 Nicaraguan protests.[16][17] The violent crackdown during 2018 protests and subsequential decrease of civil liberties have led to massive waves of migration to Costa Rica, with over 30,000 Nicaraguans filing for asylum in that neighboring country.[18]

Repression against his political opponents increased in 2021. His government jailed many of his potential rivals in the 2021 Nicaraguan general election,[19] including Cristiana Chamorro Barrios, daughter of former president Violeta Chamorro de Barrios. Ortega's government imprisoned others who opposed him, including former allies Dora Maria Tellez and Hugo Torres Jiménez.[20] In August 2021, Nicaragua cancelled the operating permits of six US and European NGOs.[21] Many critics of the Ortega government, including opposition leaders, journalists and members of civil society, fled the country in mid-2021.[22] After his 2021 reelection, Joe Biden banned the president from entering the United States.[23]",False,1646171738.0,t3_t4hpsd,t1_hyyseqo,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Uhh...this conflict is atrocious, terrible and disgusting, but at this point I'd still say WW2 is *the* most important conflict, simply because if Hitler won and entacted his twisted ideology on the whole world, billions of people would have died in the ensuing genocide even without the nukes.

That said, seeing how unstable Putin is, it might be the defining event for the rest of this century, at least.

Literally noone but the Russians would see it this way. Any action that would soley focus on defending Ukraine would be 100% justified.


>That being said, NATO and EU just sitting back and letting Ukrainians die is sending an awful message for aspiring democracies, and showing China that it could expect no military assistance for Taiwan should they choose to seize the island. The world didn't get through the Cold War by having one side unilaterally do whatever it wanted without consequences out of fear of nuclear war - there were clear red lines and escalations happened in a stepping stone way. But today EU and NATO were clearly caught by surprise, and haven't managed to go back to the kind of brinksmanship diplomacy that is proven to work.

Ukraine outlasts Russias economic investment in staying in Ukraine and tucks tail…. Does not hold onto the Donbass/Luhansk.

More realistic scenario is  much the same.. Ukraine with the international economic pressure is able to outlast Russia and they turn tail.  But in this case Russia annexes Donbass/Luhansk on their way out..

This move is met by the same international scorn as Crimea, International sanctions remain in place… but the territory gives Putin enough leeway to declare “Victory” as if it was his intention all along.  He holds onto power….

Don't believe anything unless it's coming from Western officials or Ukrainian officials. They have the assets to know for sure.

Kyiv and Kharkov have a lot of fight in them left to fight.


What needs to happen right now is a stocking up on supplies, and preparation for an occupied resistance. The Russians have the numbers to overwhelm in the short term. But they have no way near enough to occupy the country. They'll go bankrupt trying to.

Hell, at this point, it seems unlikely that any politician without a blatantly Europe-leaning policy platform could have any chance of garnering public support.  Anyone even halfway Eastern-facing would be met with stern resistance.

> ""I can see that Russia will not stop, so I must stop them,"" said Andrew Muzyka, a web developer waiting with dozens of men outside a gun shop near Lviv's medical university.

> Inside, the men received basic instructions on how to operate a firearm, then sought further approval from police before being permitted to buy one. Most models cost hundreds of dollars.



> Nearly a week since Russian troops launched an invasion of Ukraine, they have not captured a single major city after running into far fiercer resistance than they expected.

> Some experts have warned that Russia will now rely on a pitiless bombardment of built-up areas to weaken Ukrainian resistance.

> On Sunday, the Lviv police announced that the procedure to buy such weapons had been simplified. A process that had previously taken two or three weeks could now be completed in two or three days, said Muzkyka.

> He said he was thankful to other countries for their support but knew they wouldn't send troops to fight in Ukraine. ""If we can't save ourselves, nobody can,"" he said.

> The shutters at another Lviv gun shop were pulled shut, but shotguns were being dispensed from a side door by a man in military uniform.

> Among those waiting was Oleh Lekhush, who hailed from Stebnyk, about 80 km (50 miles) away. He said that the 500 people in his town's civilian defence force had only about 20 firearms between them.

> Lekhush said he ran a restaurant business and had no military experience. ""But when the tensions began on the border I started making preparations,"" he said. ""Unfortunately the only thing I didn't do was buy a weapon. But I'm hoping I will get it as soon as I can.""

> Lekhush said he would buy whatever gun he was offered and was willing to spend up to $2,000.

> Yuri Futalo, a video producer, held his documents in one hand and, in the other, the leash of a Vizsla hunting dog called Terra.

> ""I was planning to get a gun for hunting -- the season opens soon - but now it's a more urgent situation,"" he said. ""So I'm trying to get it as fast as possible, hopefully tomorrow.""

> If the Russians came, Futalo said he wouldn't hesitate to protect his loved ones, but hoped the war would soon end.

> ""It is better to hunt ducks,"" he said.

Putin might want a pro-Russian puppet government, but how tenable is that when he would probably need to station Russian forces in Ukraine long term? What happens if Putin hands power to a pro-Russian faction but then withdraws? Few in Ukraine will recognize the legal authority of a government installed at gunpoint, as as long as Zelenskyy is still alive, he is the legitimate President under Ukrainian law.

The reason these things contradict, again in my opinion now, is that there really isn't a clear picture of how this ends. Obviously Ukraine will not join the EU if a puppet government is able to control the country.",False,1646173481.0,t3_t4hpsd,t1_hyywcr8,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

 >The Pacification of Wujek  was a strike-breaking action by the Polish police and army at the Wujek Coal Mine in Katowice, Poland, culminating in the massacre of nine striking miners on December 16, 1981. It was part of a large-scale action aimed to break the Solidarity free trade union after the introduction of martial law in Poland in 1981. Although the strike was suppressed, in a longer term, it turned out to be a milestone towards the collapse of the authoritarian system in Poland and, ultimately, to the collapse of the Eastern Bloc.

At some point, citizens of western liberal democracies are going to have to ask themselves how many innocents need to be sacrificed to maintain their easy lives.

It's common knowledge that the current lifestyle of most western nations is unsustainable. That it's built on a mountain of suffering, exploitation, and human misery around the world. We all know this, in our heart of hearts, but it's also incredibly easy to distract ourselves. I think maybe this guilt is why so many people seem to be bizarrely willing to let things escalate here. It isn't that watching 45M Ukranians get subjugated is the bridge too far, it's just that when you factor in the countless millions of lives our way have life has already allowed to be ruined, ruin that we largely passively accept, the additional shame of throwing the people of Ukraine onto the pile is just too great.

I want to see the west skirt as close to Putin's edge as they dare. I want to see extreme creativity in thwarting Russia. I obviously don't want things to go past the point of no return and nuclear exchange, none of us do, but I also think there's still room for us to do more and I think that many scary calculated gambles are going to be taken, behind the scenes, as the next few days and weeks pass.",False,1646170945.0,t3_t4hpsd,t1_hyyr3qr,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

MAD assumes that the opposition is reasonable and agrees that they would never initiate a nuclear attack because they would be destroyed by the counter launch. As long as both sides agree to never initiate a nuclear launch, then we can both have nukes to also dissuade any invasion of our countries. 

But Putin views a nuclear holocaust as an acceptable outcome. Putin is threatening to initiate a nuclear attack, not react to an incoming one, not as a response to an invasion of his country (which may mean a loss of control over the nukes so they would need to launch them before losing them.) but actually initiate a nuclear holocaust. 

No other country can feel safe as long as Putin has access to a nuclear arsenal. He isn’t behaving as a rational opposition would. If this means forcing a regime change in Russia or sabotaging their nukes or something else, I don’t know.

 >The Sino-Vietnamese War (also known by various other names) was a border war fought between China and Vietnam in early 1979. China launched an offensive in response to Vietnam's actions against the Khmer Rouge in 1978, which ended the rule of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge. Both China and Vietnam claimed victory in the last of the Indochina Wars. Chinese forces invaded northern Vietnam and captured several cities near the border.
 
**[Sino-Soviet border conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict)** 
 
 >The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 near Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, which led to a return to the status quo.
 
**[Sino-Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War)** 
 
 >The Sino-Indian War between China and India occurred in October–November 1962. A disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a defensive Forward Policy from 1960 to hinder Chinese military patrols and logistics, in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of the Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959.

 >United States war crimes are the violations of the laws and customs of war which the United States Armed Forces has committed against signatories after the signing of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. These have included the summary execution of captured enemy combatants, the mistreatment of prisoners during interrogation, the use of torture, and the use of violence against civilians and non-combatants. War crimes can be prosecuted in the United States through the War Crimes Act of 1996 and through various articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
