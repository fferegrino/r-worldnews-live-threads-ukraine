>CONCLUSIONS  
>  
>In general, there will be no Ukrainian blitzkrieg. The statements of some experts such as “The Russian army will defeat most of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 30-40 minutes”, “Russia is able to defeat Ukraine in 10 minutes in the event of a full-scale war”, “Russia will defeat Ukraine in eight minutes” have no serious grounds.  
>

Remember that the Russian trolls who tried to convince the world to let Ukraine fall are still very active. Amping up nuclear existential dread is absolutely one of their goals, and as this is Putin’s last theoretical refuge when faced with a surprisingly united European and broader world, be wary. Unfortunately, this is also many people’s first brush with mortality, so there are plenty of people doing their work for them unwittingly.

Want to know how you live with the specter of death? By embracing what life gives you. Everything you experience in life has a temporal component; the good times and bad times are importantly both *times*. There is joy and pain to be found in every day, just as there was before Putin attempted to destroy another nation for his personal benefit. Embrace how sweet a lover’s hand is in yours, or the pride you feel at your child’s achievements. Live courageously; do not let a weak, hateful man rob your days of the happiness, pain, and strength that comes from overcoming challenges. Given that this will also rob him of his power is the cherry on top.

An abuser - especially a narcissist who has exulted in attacking our civil society for decades - needs you to give him permission to leave you in fear. I urge everyone here not to succumb to his need for you to let life become tainted by his  stain.

According to a recently released statement, a No 10 spokesman said:

President Zelenskiy said he believed the next 24 hours was a crucial period for Ukraine, and the prime minister said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine.”

The call follows a donors conference on Friday where defence secretary Ben Wallace said Britain would deal with the logistics of getting equipment into a war zone.

The UK has also said it will send £40m more in aid to provide vital medical supplies and assistance to Ukraine, widening economic and military support to bolster the Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion.

Edit: As pointed out below, the $20B a day cost is likely wrong. The US spent $100B a year in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the real number for Russia would be a lot less than $20B.

If that tactic leads to anything other than an overwhelming loss for Putin—if nukes become an accepted deterrent in *conventional* warfare—then every country with a conventional force will be compelled to acquire nukes themselves.

South 

In Southern frontline, Russians couldn't advance in Kherson so made small advancement towards Mykolaiv but couldn't capture the city as well. Heavy clashes also continued in the area around Nova Kakhovka.

Ukrainian forces regrouped at Orechov, and they are holding the line near Vasylivka. At the moment, there is no clear info about control in Tokmak. I assume it is partially controlled by Russians.

Russian tanks reached Dniprorudne but were driven away by local population. The situation at Enerhodar remains unknown.

North 

In Northern frontline, Kyiv is still not under Russian control. Russian units entered Bucha and Irpin near Hostomel in the morning. Ukrainian forces managed to push them back to Hostomel after fierce clashes, which resulted in dozens of Russian vehicles destroyed.

Russian tanks also spearheaded south and crossed the highway Kyiv – Zhytomyr near Motyzhyn. At the moment, Ukrainian forces trying to repel them. In Chernihiv, Ukrainian defense lines are holding. heavy fighting was reported all day long.

In Ichnia, Russian forces spearhead towards Kyiv and Russian tanks reached Nizhyn and Pryluky. Ukrainian troops at Pryluky managed to repel Russian tank attack on the town and destroyed several Russian tanks and other vehicles.

East

In Eastern frontline, some sources claim Sumy is surrounded, but the information is not verified. The city is definetely is under Ukrainian control.

Kharkiv remains under Ukrainian control. Russian forces entered Kharkiv in the morning via the main roads leading through the city. Ukrainian forces ambushed the enemy inside the city, destroyed many and drove out the rest.

Russian troops reached Okhtyrka, but Ukrainian troops based there neutralized the assault. The Russian column then turned south and continued towards Poltava. At the moment, there is no info about their location or fate.

There is some changes in Donbas frontline. In Luhansk area, Ukrainian forces withdrew from Shchastya towards Sievierodonetsk. Russians pushed west and reached Ukrainian defensive lines near Sievierodonetsk.

In Donetsk area, Russian units assaulted towards Donske and captured the town and the military base of 37th Motorized Battalion “Zaporozhye”. As a result, the situation in Volnovakha became critical and Ukrainian forces had to withdraw. By evening Ukrainians recaptured it.

In the afternoon, Russian forces managed to capture Berdyansk. At the moment, there is no Ukrainian garrison present in that area.",False,1646017364.0,t3_t34600,t3_t34600,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

tl;dr How Russia's $630B foreign currency reserves could become worthless.  We simply refuse the transaction.

>...
Most of these conversions from rubles into foreign currency take the form of computer clicks that credit or debit the electronic ledgers of financial institutions. The deposit of rubles into a bank is a click. The sale of rubles for euros or dollars is another click. The arrival of the foreign currency into the Russian customer’s account is only one click more. Very seldom does any actual paper money change hands. There’s only about $12 billion of cash dollars and euros inside Russia, according to Bernstam’s research. Against that, the Russian private sector has foreign-currency claims on Russian banks equal to $65 billion, Bernstam told me. Russia’s state-owned companies have accumulated even larger claims on Russia’s foreign reserves.

>Despite the relative scarcity of physical foreign currency inside Russia, all of these clicks can happen because Russians generally have confidence that their banks could pay foreign cash if they had to. If every Russian depositor—individual, corporate, state-owned—showed up at the same time to claim their dollars and euros, you’d have a classic bank run. But Russians don’t run on their banks, because they believe that in a real crunch, the Russian central bank would provide the needed cash. After all, the Russian central bank holds enormous quantities of reserves: $630 billion at the last tally before the start of the current war on Ukraine. In an emergency, the central bank would draw upon its reserves, provide cash to the commercial banks, and every depositor could be paid in full in the currency promised. With $630 billion in reserves, there is no way Russia would ever run out of foreign currency. You’ve probably read that assertion many times in the past few days. I actually wrote such an assertion myself in an article published last week.



>Not so fast, argues Bernstam. What does it mean that Russia “has” X or Y in foreign reserves? Where do these reserves exist? The dollars, euros, and pounds owned by the Russian central bank—Russia may own them, but Russia does not control them. Almost all those hundreds of billions of Russian-owned assets are controlled by foreign central banks. Russia’s reserves exist as notations in the records of central banks in the West, especially the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. Most of Russia’s reserves are literally IOUs to the Russian central bank from Western governments.

...

>**All of this requires the cooperation of the Fed or ECB in the first place. The Fed or ECB could say: “Nope. Sorry. The Russian central bank’s money is frozen. No transfers of dollars or euros from the Russian central bank to commercial banks. No transfers from commercial banks to businesses or individuals. For all practical purposes, you’re broke.”** It would be a startling action, but not unprecedented.

I want to provide another piece of insight into Russian culture that foreigners might not know about. All below is my personal opinion about my culture - I am hoping other Russians could jump in to comment what they think and how they relate.

There’s a certain trap narrative that gets exploited time and again in Putin’s speeches. This helps illustrate why a lot of people are silent right now.

This narrative is cultural and is deeply tied with orthodox Christianity (major religious denomination in Russia). I’ll try to bullet point it and then expand:

- Russia has its own, special way in the world history
- Russia has suffered a lot but always came out victorious - with the help of God and/or by devotion of its people
- Concept of ‘mysterious Russian soul’ (literal translation of a widely used phrase in Russia when talking about us) - something intangible about us that no outsider will ever understand
- Suffering as an acceptable Christian way of living, God’s ways are not always meant to be understood and are never meant to be questioned

Now think about the combination of both ‘suffering for the greater good as a lifestyle’ and historic antagonism ‘Russia vs the entire evil world’.

Putin, the country’s leader, spends years building and maintaining the return-to-cold-war narrative about evil West trying everything to destabilise and destroy Russia. Putin is fighting this fight alone on the world arena, having been successful so far in sticking to diplomacy.
Now, a sudden twist - Russian population is under genocide in Donbas. We must give our all to liberate them. If it means suffering, it’s automatically accepted as a tenet of Christianity and how we lived life so far. Sanctions? Isolation? It’s okay, as long as Russia and its people hold their victim values close to chest.

Now imagine someone trying to get out of this mindset. It automatically means giving up and challenging the values they lived for before. This, in its turn, might mean that you’re rejecting suffering in favour of personal responsibility for your life and taking control over what God used to have control over - and thus potentially giving up your place in heaven.

For deeply religious, Christian Russians - this is a foundation. A big slice of population - NOT religious but are in the similar trap - is involved in the government sector (so called ‘budgeteers’, people being paid out of the government budget). Those are simply scared to lose their meagre salary because it’s hard to find another job so they have to nod along with government narrative.

And this Venn diagram of the above two gets quite an overlap. This is generalised Russian ‘silent majority’. Not in Moscow, not in Saint-Petersburg - but in areas not exposed to foreign culture/language.

I’d love to write an optimistic conclusion about having a way out of it - but it will inevitably involve re-coding our culture away from ‘suffering for greater good’. And I don’t know how surmountable that is, if at all.

Last, but not least - Putin has been in power for 22 years. Putin is Christian. He has said that his life is all about Russia. People did call him monarch.

I think it’s reasonable to expect, with this time and detachment from reality, that Putin now does associate himself with Russia. Messianic duty, if I may.

This is why I am so scared to think what he will choose to do if the military operation will come to the point of surrendering and retreating. Because for him, it might very well mean that the West is beating Russia. Evil is about to beat the Good (represented by God himself).

Utah governor Spencer Cox became the latest official to instruct his state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to take off all Russian-produced and branded products from the shelves of its retail stores over the weekend.

In issuing the executive order, Cox joined the governors of New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania in taking what is largely a symbolic gesture of support for Ukraine.

“We will do our part to push back on the Russian invaders and stand with our sisters and brothers in Ukraine,” said Cox, Reuters reports. He also said that Utah would review all state procurements to check for any Russian ties.

There is no active US draft, and if you didn’t register with the Selective Service System, then you likely won’t be drafted if there ever is one again. 

There are many steps that the Department of Defense has to go through before enacting another draft. Not only that, but the threat must be greater than what our current military forces can handle. Just for context here : there’s over 1 million active duty personnel, 700k reserve personnel, and over 400k of National Guardsmen. In all honesty, we have far too many military personnel than would ever possibly be necessary in any war situation.

So earlier this was said by Russia:

This is Russian state TV: ""Our subs can launch more than 500 nuclear missiles which are guaranteed to destroy the US and all the rest of Nato into the bargain. The principle is: ""why do we need the world if there is no Russia in it?""

I researched and most ICBM can fly about 3500 miles. Say Russia wanted to nuke the US, as they are angry over sanction. Wouldn’t they have to launch from somewhere other than Russia itself? And if so, can’t our military equipment detect subs, jets and other modes of transporting these things? How can Russia have 500 nukes fired at the entire NATO without being noticed?

> The Russian government has announced it is working on a plan to evacuate its citizens from Europe, after an array of European countries closed their airspace to all Russian airlines amid Moscow’s military conflict with Kiev. 

> /u/BlatantConservative

This is a perfect example why I don't agree with banning any news source entirely from the site. It should be quarantined into the proper channel and made clear it's Russian state-sponsored propaganda, but it's still useful to know what they are saying, to analyze the patterns of public rhetoric vs the facts.

Besides, it's not the *overt* propaganda that is the problem. RT clearly identifies itself for what it is. We've already seen in the past 6 years that Russian state actors can covertly manipulate social media and influence mainstream media under the disguise of ""free press"" to advance their interests. 

I'd rather see their overt propaganda for what it is and be vigilant of covert Russian attempts to influence discourse and public opinion.",False,1646014936.0,t3_t34600,t3_t34600,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

Friends: this is Day 5 for me. I really appreciate you all being here, and for the comradery and sharing of information, the insights. I am getting burnt-out, especially because I care about the plight of the Ukrainians, so much. This feels so awful, mainly because I have been watching live cams and hearing the air-raid sirens, and seeing the aftermath.  
  
Many super rad Redditors have come in and recommended taking breaks, taking a breath, pouring a bourbon. You know. So I offer this -- a story about one of our own in the United States. It is sad at the end, when you consider his life and what happened to him. However it is also uplifting and will make you feel prideful, it will fill your heart....especially because we are looking at war, and the bravery and sacrifices of the Ukrainian Men & Women who stand tall, and alone.  
  
This is the story of C4: Charles Keating IV. He was an Arizona kid who moved with his large and colorful American family to San Diego, Coronado to be exact. And what is in Coronado? The Phillip H. Bucklew Center, where the Navy trains SEALs. BUD/S : Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training. Our SEALs, what a bad ass group of men.  
  
C4 changed his life. He left the comfort of a well-to-do great American family, he left university after 9/11, and joined the US Navy and went to BUD/S. He became a SEAL, after almost 2 years of the world's most intense and finest military training. 7 months of BUD/S, 6 months of SEAL Qualification Training, and then a months-long work-up in the Teams. He went to Team 1. He became a Chief Petty Officer. He was a fucking bad ass.  
  
Save this link. Or, watch it now to break-away from watching this conflict for a little bit. It is 30 minutes. You'll see how much fun he was, how brightly his star shined. Everyone loved him. You'll see his commitment to excellence. He was not only rad, he was good. And brave. He won the Navy Cross, the 2nd highest valorous award. He also won the Silver Star and the Bronze Star.  
  
Charlie - who the guys in the Teams called ""Chuck Heavy"" - was KIA in 2016 in Iraq, he was fighting in Operation Inherent Resolve, fighting in support of the Kurds. He was fighting on foreign soil. He gave it all. He was 31.

• Russian forces will likely resume major offensive operations on February 28 after a temporary operational pause.

• Russian forces advancing north and east from Crimea threaten to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine if Kyiv does not withdraw them in the coming days.

• Russian forces face growing morale and supply issues but will likely be able to overcome these handicaps.

• Russian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian air force also remains active. Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities as well eventually taking the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.

• Russia has sufficient conventional military power to reinforce each of its current axes of advance and overpower conventional Ukrainian forces defending them

Kyiv is one of those older cities in Europe, where you have proper *translations* of the name, rather than borrowed forms. So when you hear about Kyiv vs Kiev, think more München vs Munich, Firenze vs Florence, etc. Its name in the Ukrainian *language* is Київ, which can be transliterated Kyiv or Kyjiv and is pronounced roughly KEY-you. Meanwhile, its name in the Russian *language* is Киев, which can be transliterated Kiev or Kiyev and is pronounced KEY-yeff. So even Ukrainians, like Zolenskyy, would call it Киев if speaking Russian, because that's just its name in Russian, the same as how you'd pronounce ""Paris"" pa-REE instead of PAIR-iss if speaking French. It actually has other local names in other nearby Balto-Slavic languages, like Кіеў in Belarusian, Kijevas in Lithuanian, Kijeva in Latvian, or Kijów in Polish, though those aren't quite as interesting for the discussion. I only mention them to help provide context.

What's happening with the correction is that historically, English has used the Russian name, Kiev, but a few years after independence, Ukraine started asking the world to use its name in Ukrainian, Kyiv, instead. So calling it Kiev isn't *wrong*, per se, and is completely normal if speaking Russian. But in English, calling it Kiev has similar connotations to calling it *the* Ukraine

Also, if you speak basically any European language that isn't English, and thus pronounce ""Europe"" with sort of an AYoo at the beginning, the second syllable is actually /iw/ in IPA.

He insisted that, if Ukraine signed the agreement, it would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries borders. Russia would no longer guarantee Ukraine's status as a state and could possibly intervene if pro-Russian regions of the country appealed directly to Russia.[110]

Cars aren't really an obstacle to a tank. You must have seen the old man who had one squish his car in Kyiv? It's quite hard to create a road block of that kind.

Also, rigging something with explosives, such that they would disable a tank, is no small feat. More likely you'll rig a car with something which sets the car alight while the tanks roll over it undeterred.

I think it's clear that Russia will win the conventional war, assuming they are willing to pay the price for their hubris. An American military operation that cost 10,000+ American lives in two weeks would result in a resignation, but Putin doesn't have the same internal pressure. But Russian reputation will never be the same. There is zero chance they would win a conventional war with Europe and they are a second-rate military power throwing men and material away needlessly. They can't keep their forces supplied for more than 72 hours fighting a war 50km away from their border. Upper Volta with nuclear weapons, as they used to say, and will probably start saying again.

I'm more interested to see whether they stay in Ukraine. Asymmetrical warfare took a toll on the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US had plenty of well armed local allies against poorly resourced opponents. A Ukranian insurgency would be the best armed insurgency in history, would have the entire US COINTEL playbook and know how to beat it, and Russia won't have the luxury of deploying Ukranian forced to handle the heaviest fighting.

Putin doesn't care how he is seen by other nations. I am not entirely sure if he cares by he is seen in Russia lol (I mean, his projected image is one thing but it's different than what he really acts like). 

> If you are Putin, what do you gain by a nuclear first strike, and what do you lose?

Unconditional surrender of Ukraine followed by seizing all their territories. I mean, you can't really fight back if your capital city has turned into a pile of radioactive waste and Russia is threatening to do it again. Or rather - you can but this DOES remove chain of command and puts everyone into a state of shock and panic. 

What is stopping Putin is that he did not plan to actually struggle. All his initial plans seemed to be ""assassinate current government, install his own"". Russia is physically incapable of controlling over 40 million people in Ukraine and they wanted to reuse the infrastructure without at least a semblance of approval (even if it's approval forced by tanks and military). This much seems to have solid foundations in reality - taking over an airport, preparing planes with diplomats to replace current ones, not having proper logistic lines prepared ahead of the time. It was meant to be a quick war. 

However it seems like western-equipped Ukraine is actually putting more struggle than anticipated. It's hard to say by how much (remember, Ukraine is making it's own propaganda too, we do NOT know how many soldiers, tanks and planes they have left) and with every passing day Russia is paying billions to continue fighting. 

Generally speaking - Putin doesn't NEED nukes to win if his plan was to turn Ukraine into a wasteland. They have a lot of traditional warheads with high-yield too - leveling whole cities **is** possible. So if there is one used, it would be solely to instill terror.

> Am I missing something? I know he's evil. I don't think he's crazy or stupid though.

It depends. I find it unlikely he will launch nukes but... remember that losing this war is the end of him. Not just figuratively, he will be killed over it. It has already turned into an economic nightmare, he HAS to show results for all of this. Otherwise it means #2 military in the world status is now meaningless, thousands of tanks were lost, tens of thousands of soldiers were dead or wounded and their economy is in shambles as that single decision has most likely pushed Europe into looking into other energy suppliers and that's like 30% of Russian GDP.

I am not entirely sure if Russian government CAN back on this one. They need some sort of victory to keep them afloat. Nuclear weapons COULD give them that victory. At least temporarily because it would mean they are losing in the long term but that's the scary part - do they now care about long run or they do just need a quick ""victory""? 

I don't think West will retialiate with their own nukes. However if one is launched and fallout does reach any NATO states... Europe has most likely already exceeded Putin's and Russia's expectations in their response. They must have heard of Germany going with ""hey, we are going to spend 100 billion a year on military now"" which is more than Russia itself can do. They have to consider that NATO forces will be utilized to stabilize Ukraine's situation and threaten to use their own nuclear weaponry in case Russia tries anything funny.

*Global humanitarian organizations* are involved (UN, IRC, CARE, Red Cross), and refugees have been displaced to rescue programs in *multiple countries and entities* (US, UK, EU, etc.).

The best example is the Mongols in 1300s, they have only \~100k Mongols at all times, but 10x of troops from different ethnicity.

> When Vladimir V. Putin declared Sunday that he was putting his nuclear forces into “special combat readiness” — a heightened alert status reminiscent of some of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War — President Biden and his aides had a choice.

> They could match the move and put American forces on Defcon 3 — known to moviegoers as that moment when the Air Force rolls out bombers, and nuclear silos and submarines are put on high alert. Or the president could largely ignore it, sending out aides to portray Mr. Putin as once again manufacturing a menace, threatening Armageddon for a war he started without provocation.

> For now, at least, Mr. Biden chose to de-escalate. The American ambassador to the United Nations reminded the Security Council on Sunday afternoon that Russia was “under no threat” and chided Mr. Putin for “another escalatory and unnecessary step that threatens us all.” The White House made it clear that America’s own alert status had not changed.

Likewise Russians have loved ones, brothers, sisters, cousins in UA- there is unrest in Russia and they don’t want to increase it. Russia has shown us that they haven’t been putting money into new military or up keeping military, and nukes cost a shit ton to upkeep. I get it’s scary, I really struggled mid week when this started, but we’ve seen mass sharing of intelligence, and mass support and unifying despite all this horror. For all the posturing, everyone has stuck to the rules- when Putin told NATO ‘stay the fuck out or I will attack’ , NATO responded ‘You fucking attack us here, Fuck around and find out’. It’s loud and alarming but nobody seemingly wants a world war here. There’s a lot lot lot of echo chamber sensationalism here in Reddit where people are quick to share unconfirmed news, and in media where remember, they still want your clicks and time. Ultimately, nothing will change in the time it takes to take care of yourself and do something that makes you not feel terrible.",False,1646017711.0,t3_t34600,t1_hyqaax2,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

This is a game of cowboys staring at each other, and all movements must be acquainted and accounted for on both sides.

If you ask me, the fact that when ""talks"" were settled he raised the nuclear alert is a message to the west and to Ukraine: we're in this position now. No one moves until peace talks.

Úrsula von der leyen message of NATO not buying it and providing Ukraine with planes and potentially emergency allowing them into the EU is exactly the kind of changing of base condition for the peace talks Putin probably didn't want, potentially making those talks fail due to Ukraine feeling reinvigorated.

Putin might interpret this as a potential failure and feel pressed against the fence. And it's no good.

Hope ukranian leadership, not to surrender but to show commitment with showing that there are still diplomatic channels doesn't refuse to go to the meeting, and de-escalate the nuclear threat. Europe has done nothing in that regard.

And I repeat, I'm not vouching for them to surrender, I'm just saying that Europe decided to fully commit with Ukraine at the exact point you would interfere with the situation if you wanted the war to carry on. And the dead here are ukranian and Russian soldiers.

Hope the ukranians aren't used in that way, to put their lives and country in more peril so that Europe can have it's political victory. And hope that Putin doesn't take the bait and escalate more.

Hitler didn't stop when he was appeased and allowed to occupy Czechoslovakia -- it only made him stronger and he only went after more countries.
