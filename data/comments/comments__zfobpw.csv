Day 287-288 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday not much happened other than the usual shelling/missile strikes on Kupiansk, which sadly is a daily occurrence by now, but thankfully I don’t think there were any casualties. Today the day started with explosions at around 9am, but instead of Kharkiv they happened in Belgorod, and not close to the border either. There was a pretty big fire, though I’m not sure what was hit, I don’t think there were any additional reports about it after it happened.

Then most of the rest of the day was quiet until 8:50pm, when Russians started firing their missiles from Belgorod yet again, this time aimed in our direction. Some of the missiles were intercepted and some hit residential buildings somewhere in Kharkiv oblast. From the photos that were posted we see that the missile possibly directly hit a private house (not enough angles to know for sure) and barely missed 2 more houses, landing about 2-5 meters away from them, which still damaged them quite a lot.

We actually even heard the explosions happen, which means it’s not that far from the city, and the air raid alert triggered after the missiles already landed, so there was no warning. At first, we even thought that the missiles landed somewhere in the city because it was actually pretty loud. We know about 4 civilian casualties so far, thankfully no deaths were reported, but one person is in a bad condition.

So watch for where the most strikes on C3 and log are, and it may be an indication of their next moves.

So in partly venting about this, I'm just going to highlight some points that should be considered:

The US State Department is tasked take care of their own no matter what. Imagine if you will it was YOUR kid, your parent in a gulag. You'd do and trade anyone for them. In a similar manner, on a national level, the United States government has an unequivocal obligation to protect its citizens for wrongful or egregious convictions. She was a political prisoner and ultimately really did nothing wrong. In all likelihood the tiny bit of hash would be thrown out in customs and she'd be given a pass. But of course she was useful high-profile pawn this time. It's clearly wrongful imprisonment and she simply is a professional athlete pursuing her career in a previously-agreed upon contract with a sports league there. 

You may be upset your kid carelessly walked down the wrong back alley, but still let's not victim-blame, now.

Sure, the arms dealer deserves being behind bars. But Brittany DID NOT. And if you knew anything about the fundamental backbone of nearly all Western Judicial systems, which is Judge Blackstone's, ""It is better that ten guilty escape than one innocent suffer."" — you'd understand why this was a no-brainer.

The only substantive thing people should be talking about is the fact that Marc Fogel, a US Teacher in Russia is imprisoned in Russia under what are essentially the same charges as Griner. He too deserves to be released.

**Edit:** These are some really incredible arguments. The summation of which I see:

- People pretending that Russian courts are legitimate and just (If you're educated on this topic at all, you'll know they are anything but)
- People hiding what is morally-wrong behind what is Legal
- People who strangely may be oppose to cruel & unusual punishment in other contexts ranging from Phillippine drug laws, SA to Qatar to Taliban stoning in other contexts, but seemingly turned a blind-eye here.
- Many who try to argue legal merits seem to deflect the reality that our Judicial Philosophy in America is completely centered around protecting the innocent or tortured over imprisoning the guilty.

**Edit 2**: I'm going to quote a conversation that just wrapped-up with a person below because I think it succinctly captures the hole in arguments I'm trying to point out:

>> **Do I believe the punishment fit the crime? Definitely no**t. I don't think marijuana possession should be a crime at all.

>>If she actually **was 100% innocent**, maybe.


>DUDE, It's right there in front of you and you can't GRASP IT! This is a selfawarewolves moment. Entertain for just a fucking second that what is innocent isn't necessarily what is the ""law"". Of course the Taliban believe in stoning women for adultery, but does that make it morally-right that they do so!?

Imagine a drone entering US airspace from Mexico, and hitting Area 51 without a single missile being fired at it, or without some fighters being scrambled to intercept it. It is insane.   


What this shows is that Russia fundamentally lacks air defense and detection systems, because they have either all been taken into Ukraine, destroyed, or never existed to begin with. Of course, one could argue that such a large country is impossible to completely cover with air defense, but we are talking about a military base where strategic bombers are kept, surely, this sort of thing should not happen on paper, right?

Ukraine hitting the Crimean bridge, on the other hand, did have a specific military purpose, since Russia is using it to supply their invasion force in the south; they also hit it months after Russia invaded *for the second time*.

This thread is useful, but many of us have found it easier to just read an ISW summary or a Defmon3 thread and call it good.

“The mission of the Department of State is to represent America’s foreign policy abroad, and to advance the interests and security of the American people”

With respect to this statement, Griners release is undoubtedly related to her own security. And I’m glad shes free. I don’t want to see her imprisoned, and there are a few Americans that still are. What I disagree with is that it was in the interests of the American people, especially as it pertains to foreign policy. We just handed back one of the worlds most dangerous arms smuggler back to Russia, who will most likely be put back to work on what he does best. Sanction busting. Arguments exist that he is out of the game now after being behind bars, but that domain knowledge doesn’t leave you. And Russia will most certainly bring him up to speed and provide the requisite connections to keep operating. They are on a war footing and it’s all hands on deck after all. 

In light of that, as Russia continues their war effort, and having the possibility of using The Merchant of Death, how does that work in favour of US foreign policy as per the State Dept mission statement?

She was actually arrested before the Ukraine war started, are you under the impression people weren't being arrested for what she did? 
In my eyes she did nothing wrong but if Russia's eyes she did. You need to follow a countries laws when you go there, regardless of what you think about those laws. This applies to people visiting America too btw, there are some pretty fucked up laws in the country people may not be used to.

You can argue about the immorality of the law, or that she was targeted for enforcement, and I’m not going to disagree with that.

Granted, the punishment in the US would be not be the same as Russia (even so far as no punishment at all), but saying she did nothing wrong is plainly and simply not accurate.  

If she was arrested and imprisoned for actually no reason at all, that'd be different.  But she admitted she brought cannabis into the country.  Ignorance of the law is no excuse.  She should have known better.  

Now I happen to disagree with the law, both in the US and Russia, but this was not an equitable trade.

- In the latter case what is stopping Russia from randomly arresting the next American citizen on false charges so they can swap out more arms dealers or similar worthwhile prisoners? In such a case her or Marc Fogel won't be the last of 'em.

Although I really have no doubt it was an honest mistake on her part, she's not an 'innocent victim'.

Nobody is 'victim blaming'. Smuggling drugs (accidental or not) is illegal, and simply tends to have very negative consequences.

A closer but imperfect one would be the US during the American revolution, since Spain and France both supported the Americans in order to hurt England.

The problem with this rhetoric is that it perpetuates Russia's false equivalence between Russia's actual invasion of Ukraine and NATO's imagined 'expansion' toward Russia.

Ukraine is a sovereign European state. They have the right to sign whatever treaties they want, and to both not be invaded, and to resist invasion if it comes.

Ukraine's joining NATO would not mean that NATO 'claimed' or 'controlled' or 'owned' Ukraine. It would simply mean that Ukraine had chosen to join that alliance-- chiefly to protect themselves from Russia's aggression.

Nor is NATO 'expanding' simply because other states want to join NATO. That's completely ass-backwards.

The nature of Griner's celebrity status works against her as much as it does for her, sadly. If they were a random joe, it probably wouldn't take as much to trade for her either, and Russia clearly knows this. We will see how the Marc Fogel case develops as it now enters the spotlight.

This happens a lot especially when it comes to Western support, because their resources are capable of producing a drastic effect that could effectively ""end"" the conflict, at least in its current form. 

Obviously, both individuals and governments have their own ideas about what would happen in the aftermath, and their own evaluation of the cost to get to that point.

We can be on the same page about defeating Russia, but maintaining an effective coalition demands consideration of a variety of opinions on how to get there. Someone who is prepared to sacrifice everything can't be left to feel abandoned or ignored, but it often feels like walking a tightrope to give them what they need without scaring off more cautious allies who have more abstract concerns than someone who has experienced more direct suffering at the hands of the enemy.

Take heart that this approach is working, even as it's frustrating to watch in real time.

> The 1st Guards Tank Army is a divisions-sized formation tank army of the Russian Ground Forces. This requires a bit of explanation. During the Cold War, Soviet divisions - with about 10,000 soldiers - were always smaller than their similarly named Western counterparts, which typically had rather more than 15,000 soldiers. In no small part this was due to the fact that Western divisions had a variety of organic support formations that were deployed at the Corps rather than Division level in the Soviet Army. Whatever the cause, this practice had the additional benefit of inflating the size of the Soviet army relative to the West, when measured in divisions.

> ...

> As the post-Soviet army shrank after 1991, individual units withered, and brigades assumed the lineage and honors of pre-existing divisions. Putin reversed this trend in 2012, when the 2nd and 4th Brigades [hnorifices aside] were upgraded to Divisions. and their subordinate battalions in turn became brigades. One happy effect of this move was to inflate the rank structure, as former brigade officers now became division officers of higher rank, though with no greater responsibility. Thus a Tank Army, of two divisions and multiple seperate brigades, can have an actual troop strength of a division in a Western army.

US CBP public announcements meant to scare the public against bringing weed into the country don't even suggest that's on the table even for a whole lot more than that.

CBP officers may also turn the case over to state and local departments for prosecution."" ....no mention of federal imprisonment. https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-reminds-public-all-marijuana-imports-are-prohibited

There are no people in American prisons for smuggling less than one gram of THC wax across the American border. That is the correct answer. You know darn well you weren't asking a hypothetical.
