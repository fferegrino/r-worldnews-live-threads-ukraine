Ukraine tells Brazilian leader after he criticised allies
Ukraine has invited the Brazilian president to visit the war-torn country and see for himself the consequences of the Russian invasion, while criticising his efforts to broker peace talks. 

It comes a day after Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, visited Lula in Brasilia and remarked on Brazil and Russia's shared views on the ongoing war. 

Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian foreign ministry, confirmed the invitation for Lula to visit Kyiv on social media ""to understand the real causes of Russian aggression and its consequences for global security"".

He said Ukraine was following with interest Lula's efforts to find a solution to the war, but did not accept that ""the victim and the aggressor"" be treated the same way. 

He also rejected the view that ""countries that help Ukraine defend against deadly aggression are accused of encouraging war,"" a reference to Lula's comments over the weekend, when he accused the US and the European Union of prolonging the war by supplying arms to the Ukrainians.

Solovyov joked that the plan on how to rule the world was written on a napkin and would be drawn up while individuals sat in a restaurant.  
Tretyakov continued: ""When Putin said that the next 10 years would be hard of course this doesn't pertain only to war on the territory of the former Ukraine, which should be simply liquidated as a nation.  
""The same way Hitler's Nazi nation was liquidated, it was simply liquidated. Then it can be decided what to do with the lands and the people who used to serve this nation, but that is a separate topic.""  
Solovyov added that Russia should now focus on training new European leaders that favor Russia.

Day 418-419 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were somewhat quiet, but recently Russians have started to use guided bombs (their versions of JDAMs) much more frequently and the areas near the border are their prime targets. They have been using them almost every day during the past week, so we had a couple of air raid alerts because their planes were launching bombs in the direction of Kharkiv oblast.

We thought that they were launching missiles at first, but if they were missiles, their planes wouldn’t have to fly near our border to launch them, all of their air launched missiles can be fired from hundreds of kilometers away. I’m not sure what the maximum range of their equivalent of JDAM is, but it seems likely that it’s around 5-15km, because the reports of them being used all come from the border areas (and also near the frontline).

Today they also launched a bunch of Shaheds at Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro, but I’m pretty sure all of them were intercepted, or at least 7 of them, we don’t know how many were actually launched. They are pretty active today for some reason, because about an hour ago there were reports of our air defense intercepting something in Odesa as well, probably also a Shahed, they launch them from Crimea quite frequently.",False,1681861947.0,t3_12q9nqt,t3_12q9nqt,,0,110,0,110,0,0,

Making the comment at the end of his visit to Beijing at the weekend, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also said the US needs to ""start talking about peace"".

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said today that Mr Lula was ""parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda"" with his remarks.

The battle for Bakhmut has been going on for almost ten months. Despite significant losses, Russian forces continue to storm the city, slowly moving forward. The confrontation moved to the central part of the city. The fighting in the dense urban development takes place at minimal distances. In some places, the occupiers and the Ukrainian military are only few meters apart, which complicates the defense. At the same time, not a single sign of ""shell hunger"", which was previously announced by the ""Wagner"" PMC, is not noticed here. Instead, there are changes in the personnel of the enemy. Along with the other defense forces, Ukrainian border guards continue to protect Bakhmut.

1) Putin hope: Russia continues to grind and send in mobilized troops with basic equipment to stabilize the line until western democracies lose focus and Russia is able to overwhelm poorly equipped Ukrainian positions. They get their land bridge to Crimea, militarized buffer lands between Russia and the west (donbas), and learn to live without trade to the west. Most importantly Putin successfully distracts his populace from the fact that he is a kleptocratic trillionaire who has stagnated their economy for 15 years by waving an old school imperial victory in their faces. 

2) The West's gambit: Russias army continues to lose equipment at an unsustainable rate, their economy goes into freefall with sanctions and lost oil revenue. Eventually Russia stops attacking as it simply cannot afford to continue and holds defensive lines to maintain the illusion of a victory. Slowly after years the financial and human cost of holding onto annexed territory gets less and less palatable and they withdrawal (likely under the next leader once Putin dies) completely in order to secure trade deals with the west again and drop sanctions.

3) Forever war: like israel/Palestine both sides see the conflict as existential. Their economies are able to putter along enough to maintain a low level of conflict at the front for years/decades.

The reality is that Ukraine is facing a very siginifcant challenge for this counter offensive, and one could argue that this is a bigger challenge than Kherson was. Russia has had months to prepare to meet this counter offensive and contrary to Kherson the ydon't have a river to bottleneck their supplies, and they have enacted measures to solve some of the issues that allowed the Kharkiv counter offensive to be so successful, so it's is unlikely that Ukraine will achieve the type of success that Kharkiv gave them. And because of all these high expectations, if Ukraine doesn't achieve that level of success, if it's only a partial success people will see this as a defeat.

In this case the Ambassador is simply offering a realistic analysis: Russia has achieved something, Ukraine must now take that back and that is not going to be easy as Ukraine would have liked to have had more heavy weaponry and Russia has been establishing elaborate defensive lines. He also points to the dynamic where there are now (bizarrely) high expectations towards the Ukrainian counter offensive, when in reality Russia is not likely to repeat past mistakes that lead to earlier breakthroughs.

The West is preparing for Russia to go ballistic when Ukraine pushes them hard. Will the gloves come off? Despite the level of atrocity thus far, there's room for it to get much nastier.

It could be the most dangerous phase of the war. Russia made alot of noise about their offensive. It was underwhelming to put it mildly. Now the trolls say there never was an offensive, that the Ukrainian side made it up.

To me, that says Russia has pushed as far as they are able to fighting this way. A new round of troops and old tanks won't likely change things or offer any reason to be optimistic. Basically, having used alot of their best men and gear, each wave seems to perform worse. I also can't find a reason why the large scale missle attacks have basically ceased other than inventory issues. They could remedy that by purchasing and maybe they have, but no evidence yet. 

Ukraine, on the other hand, is massing men and weapons that are superior to what they have fielded previously. Their capabilities and effectiveness could be increasing in a significant way. If they pull off their own maskerovka and really put the Russians on their heels despite their defensive efforts, the whole damn thing could come apart. The finger pointing, fear, and grim reality may be enough to unravel morale and cohesion between various elements in the Russian war machine.

So if that happens, what will Russia do? Will they sulk in silence, lick their wounds, try to stall to re arm? Will they go home? Will Putin survive it politically? Will Putin do something drastic in an attempt to save face in the face of lacking a military capable of achieving his objectives without resorting to unconventional means?

And look how long it took Russia to conquer Mariupol!

In contrast, look how things have gone for Ukraine in the counteroffensives they've conducted so far (Kherson and Kharkiv); comparatively very well.

There are no longer any low hanging fruit for the russians to pick, and their strengths seem to be diminishing.

In contrast, a large chunk of Ukraine's personnel (i.e., their training) and materiel are urgently being upgraded so that they are coming *closer* to NATO strategies and standards.

\------------------------

\*For the first few rounds, Ali employed his novel and now celebrated “rope-a-dope” technique, allowing himself to be battered back against the ropes around the ring and fooling Foreman into thinking he had the upper hand.  \[Sounds anything like Bahkmut?\]

By deflecting the younger champ’s \[i.e., Foreman's\] savage blows, however, Ali sapped his opponent’s strength for seven rounds.

It could be that he doesn’t trust that in an emergency, the driver would know how to react.  It could theoretically be that he doesn’t trust giving the route out for security and drives himself, but that sorta doesn’t make sense since security would need to be posted along the route.

Nuclear portion is 49B roubles, which at the pre-war exchange rate would =~ $661.5MM, mostly for maintenance (100-200 on new development of delivery systems).   That's a little over 1% of their budget, and we’ve seen how the military spent the other 99%.

The US spends ~$49B on theirs, Per the [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57130).  The UK, fielding 120 active weapons is at [$6.8B](https://demilitarize.org.uk/new-report-reveals-uk-spent-6-8bn-on-nuclear-weapons-in-2021/).

Before the war, Russia's entire GDP was less than Texas', or Italy's.  You can't credibly maintain 1500 active devices and 4500 stockpiled with that input - let alone develop wunderwaffen.  It is less than some US school districts spend on their lunch budgets.

At best they concentrated their funds in a much smaller number, say 10-25, that still work.  But that assumes much more stringent financial controls than evident anywhere else in their military or government.

I understand what you're saying, but it's speculation and you can't change the past. Russia has dug trenches and built up defenses to at least a limited extent along their border with Ukraine. They've also sent tens of thousands of troops to Belarus for training, and haven't at all abandoned Russian border regions. 

I agree with you 100% this would change the nature of the war today. I have conflicting opinions as to whether or not this should happen. If you're Ukraine, opening up a second front along the Russian border, likely takes resources away from other counteroffensive. If the main objective is to take back Ukrainian territory this can help, but I don't know what other options exist. This particular option has the potential to be a distraction, and at worst lead to escalation and broader conflict. Then it also raises the question, what about Russian troops in Belarus? Are they a fair target, or where do you draw the line? 

Russia has weak points inside of Ukraine that Ukraine can exploit. There will be many options for how the coming months unfold, but neither side has infinite resources.

Major offensives encountered essentially no resistance, the bulk of the Iraqi conscript 'normal' army never fought at all. The US/coalition troops would arrive at Iraqi defensive 'bastions,' shell them for an hour, and then the Iraqis would surrender. In one case, the Iraqi commander lodged a complaint because they didn't let him surrender *fast enough*, shelling his base for longer than he felt was humanitarian.

But these speedy surrenders caused the various combat groups/flanks of the invasion to outpace their timetables and logistic lines. Schwarzkopf was adjusting on the fly and asked units to move/engage up to a day earlier than when they had been scheduled to. So you ended up with convoys/formations out of position, sometimes drifting into the range of other units. A lot of the friendly fire was air-on-ground, helicopters and A10s seeing 'well thats a column of armor that isn't supposed to be there' and opening fire. They annoyed the British with it to the degree that they abandoned stealth and started flying huge Union jacks openly.

The only real fighting/slow going was against the Republican Guard, including one unexpected counterattack.
