>
>The brazen, midday attack on civilians in their homes has renewed urgent calls for Ukraine’s allies to immediately provide the country with upgraded air defenses that can help repel the missiles used in the attack, which officials here said their current system cannot detect. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said the death toll from the attack had risen to at least 30, added Sunday that another 30 residents were unaccounted for.
>
>Hundreds of civilians gathered at the scene Sunday, rattled by the strike on Dnipro, which has been known as a relatively safe haven for the past nearly 11 months of war. Some pleaded for western countries to speed up the delivery of additional weapons and help protect Ukrainians from more unpredictable airstrikes.
>
>“How many other people have to die until the world will see us?” asked Aziza Nosenko, 30, a baker who was handing out sandwiches to volunteer rescuers digging through what remained of the apartment building on Sunday night.
>
>“We’re full of anger and disappointment,” said her friend, Oleksandra Ratushna, 33.
>
>“Only anti-aircraft missile systems, which in the future may be provided to Ukraine by Western partners … are capable of intercepting these air targets,” he said, naming the American Patriot system and the French SAMP/T system as examples.
>
>Zelensky said Saturday that “[n]o amount of persuasion or just passing the time will stop the terrorists who are methodically killing our people.”
>
>“The whole world knows what can stop and how it’s possible to stop those who sow death,” he said.

""*Turkey continues to block Finland and Sweden from joining NATO*  


*Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey's parliament will only approve Sweden and Finland joining NATO if they extradite ""130 terrorists"" to Turkey. With this, Turkey continues to block the accession of these countries.*  


*The two Scandinavian countries applied for NATO membership last year because they no longer feel safe after the Russian attack on Ukraine. To become a member, the consent of all thirty member states is required. Turkey is the only Member State that is obstructive. President Erdogan wants Sweden in particular to take a tougher stance against Kurds in that country and Turks whom he sees as supporters of his arch enemy Fethullah Gülen.*

*The three countries appeared to have reached an agreement in June. According to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, Sweden and Finland were no longer in the way of joining. Turkey then demanded the extradition of 33 terrorism suspects. In December, Sweden extradited a Turkish-Kurdish man to Turkey. That, according to Erdogan, is not enough.*

*In Sweden, a judge decides whether someone can be sent back to Turkey. The Swedish government has no influence on this. In addition, Turkey and Sweden define terrorism differently. Swedish Prime Minister Kristersson said last week that Turkey is making too many demands and that his country cannot meet all the conditions.*""",False,1673890013.0,t3_10d4hmu,t3_10d4hmu,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

For air-launched cruise missiles, the AGM-86 has a long range, plus I believe only nuclear variants are left and the AGM-84H appears to require significant integration, which leaves only the AGM-158.  The standard range version has a range of 370km, long enough to hit any Russian target within Ukraine, and more importantly, work has already been done on it to create a platform-agnostic launcher in the form of Rapid Dragon.  I don't think any of those systems will be given to Ukraine, but the AGM-158 fits within the load capacity of the Su-24, and the work done on rapid dragon could be utilized to make an adapter that will allow it to launch the missile.",False,1673904883.0,t3_10d4hmu,t1_j4myan4,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

I think we'll find that Ukraine has had every weapon they want very close to when they were able to effectively use it. However, USA weapons are meant to be used by the USA - a huge economy with a massive investment in logistics. So if you want to use USA weapons **at war scale** (an important consideration!) you need similar logistics.

War logistics is:

* Getting an impactful amount of item X to the proper location in enough time to make a difference
* Providing enough consumables (fuel, parts, ammunition, etc) to operate item X.
* Protect the logistics from attack by the enemy (russia has had this problem since HIMARS arrived, for example).
* Repair/replace damaged items in enough time to make a difference on the battlefield.

Consider this: 

The USA has these ships where they store a month or so of combat stuff. The idea is they can land somewhere and dump off a useful chunk of combat power very quickly. 

If the USA (magically) dropped all the equipment and supplies in Kyiv today, it would take weeks to use the stuff (not everyone is trained!), and after the supplies (~30 days or so) are exhausted, the equipment becomes unusable for combat at war scales. No more gas, ammo, repair parts, etc.

**Yes, we should give Ukraine whatever it needs to beat russia**. But handing them enough stuff to last only a month would not work.

In short, it takes time to deliver on logistics. USA has been working on it for decades. Ukraine has had less than a decade to prepare. As the supply chain matures in Ukraine it will naturally support heavier and more complex combat systems. I believe that as soon as the logistics support (a combat thing) Ukraine will have it.",False,1673880623.0,t3_10d4hmu,t1_j4l322i,,1,22,0,22,0,0,

fb53018967b79dec83069ea11ea07455,10d4hmu,j4lgjnj,"I am gonna pull a completely different argument:

Because their flight-signature (speed, altitude, angles) is too unique.

Bear with me.

The shorter range GMLRS HIMARS missiles keep getting through russian air defense. We meme ""what air defense doing"" but it's not really a credible meme (/r/ncd in shambles). They get through not because air defenses are inactive, but because the way they are used is abusing the fact that russian air defenses have a cap on how much stuff they can intercept at once.

When HIMARS (or MARS respectively) system fires GMLRS, it fires 6 (12) missiles at the same time. If you grab three launchers, you get 18(36) missiles in a short burst flying the same direction, same speed, same altitude. On top of that missiles from GRADs while short ranged also have very similar pattern. So they can fire HIMARS from way back, then saturate the air closer to the front with GRADs.   
A russian soldier sitting in a S-400 radar will see dozens, if not hundreds of missiles in a short span, all labelled as GRAD missiles. They know these could be HIMARS, but they cannot possibly single out the HIMARS missiles in the bunch and/or shoot all of them down all at once.  This way, HIMARS missiles get through even active defense.


Meanwhile ATACMS missile pattern is very unique and there's only 1 per launch pod. It's much more likely russian defenses will pick these up and they won't get through at all. even covered up by grads, the system will recognize them and they can be singled out.

I believe the reason why UA didn't get ATACMS is because it would be useless. It is equally likely that they already have similar missiles of their own that they cannot use at these longer distances because they simply won't get through. Supplying them with ATACMS would be a waste of logistics.


The better question is in my opinion: why isnt this being used as the main explanation in the international public community?

I think the answer to that is: at least one of the reasons why this is is not publicly known. Yet. And because of that, even starting to explain it this way bears the danger of giving away that reason.",1673887699.0,1673883719.0,t3_10d4hmu,t1_j4l322i,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

Then they need to make sure the supply lines to maintain and repair them are in place, which is even more complicated than usual because some parts of that supply line will be in the conflict (Ukraine) and others in nato countries.

Then you need to facilitate the training of the crews of these vehicles, the mechanics who repair them, the supply specialists who coordinate their repairs and parts and the officers that lead them to battle.

This would pose problems in the early months of the war for sure. But if the governments of these countries were serious about stopping Russia, then those governments could have at least attempted to sort this out in the intervening 11 months. 

Yet here we are, and only just recently are western governments even inching toward a decision around supplying real offensive weapons. Not delivering, just authorizing. How much longer in your mind is this acceptable? How many more civilians have to die? How much more Ukrainian infrastructure must be destroyed? And to be clear, while the US has been supplying Ukraine heavily here, I still include them. So Abrams won’t work due to logistics; I can accept that. There are things that won’t make sense and we have to be judicious. But why has it taken this long to supply even a tiny amount of bradleys? 

At some point, the excuses have to stop. If this is seriously the best supply effort that western governments could have managed, then that is a pretty damning indictment of our collective ability to wage war by proxy.

I'm at the point though where I think the West should simply say ""no, you're done"" and use tomahawks and air power (not boots) devastate every Russian position within Ukraine until they fuck off.  Starting with Wagner, naturally.

**That's a total pipe dream, I know**.  But if you're *actually* serious about Russia fucking off, that's what it's going to come to.  The idea that you can just truck in enough enough weapons, slowly increasing in quantity, lethality, and technological advancement (eventually planes), while training hundreds of thousands of users... barring a total collapse and rout, it will take years and countless lives, *at best*.  Russia will just throw conscripts and convicts and bodies at you to exhaust you while a couple of your guys in the back sit anxiously through training classes.

You want to end it *now*?  Step in.  Air power's the safest, after all, and Russia has consistently stated they're fighting NATO.  Make it a fucking reality.  Show them conquest by force of arms is simply not permitted.  Edit #2: this would have the advantage of sending a *rather* clear message to China, also.

Ben Hodges has talked about this at length. There are legitimate questions being asked on how quickly NATO countries could ready heavy units, deploy them, and then sustain high intensity combat operations. NATO shifted from an airland battle in Europe to global peacekeeping/COIN operations. There is much good equipment on paper, but how much of it is combat ready and how long could it be sustained is very questionable. This war has opened many eyes in Europe - that’s one reason why we’re seeing such a dramatic increase in budgets across the continent. Not all of it is going to acquisition, much is being spent on logistics and maintenance.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/politics/us-wagner-group-mercenaries-terrorists/index.html

And not much else about it.

Before that there were some largely symbolic bills in the house and senate to designate russia as a state sponsor of terrorism that also didn’t go anywhere.

The argument, which I think is a silly argument, is that recognizing russia as a state sponsor of terrorism would cause a cascade of knock-on effects due to the few things russia does massively export. Basically, we don’t want to have to sanction poorer countries for receiving cheap life essentials (like fertilizer) from russia.

That argument is bullshit because we could 100% whip up a very special terrorism designation package for them, my country is literally built on loopholes. It’s loopholes all the way down. We could absolutely designate russia as state sponsors terrorism without screwing over the already screwed, a few pen strokes and a vote. We do it with omnibus bills regularly for all manner of dumb shenanigans. Unfortunately, that would take a level of cooperativeness, industry, and ethics the majority of them simply do not possess; plus it would detract from the time allocated for dumb shenanigans.

If they cry more, sink the Black Sea Fleet, start going after submarines, and bomb Wagner in other countries they operate in (drop the pretense that they aren't an extension of Russia).

Then park a garrison in Ukraine and dare Russia to attack Ukraine again.

What Ukraine does or does not include in negotiation has consequences.  Leaders in Kyiv need to be responsible.

Not to say they shouldn't put in an order anyway, so at least it is an option later on, but this isn't going to make a major difference in the next counter offensive. At best it might let Ukraine hit a few longer distance high-value targets when they do their battlefield shaping, but you also have to consider air defenses will pluck a few of those out of the sky, at least. Maybe more since they are fundamentally just glide bombs with rocket motors to get them past the boost stage.

It really is ATACMS or bust. At least so long as you assume cruise missiles are truly off the table, which I imagine they are if it takes this much effort just to get ATACMS. Either that or adapt air-launched precision missiles for Ukraine's MiGs/Su jets. This isn't necessarily a great option though if Ukraine needs to launch them close to the front line to hit the range they need. That is exactly where Russian air defenses threaten air support the most.",1673918723.0,1673918513.0,t3_10d4hmu,t1_j4nqw2i,,7,5,0,5,0,0,
