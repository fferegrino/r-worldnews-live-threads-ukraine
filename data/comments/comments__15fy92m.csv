>**Danube Ports, a Lifeline for Ukraine, Come Under Russian Threat**
>
>*Since the collapse of the Black Sea grain deal two weeks ago, small ports on the Danube River are the only shipping outlet for millions of tons of grain.*
>
>When Russia blockaded Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea after its full-scale invasion last year, grain that could feed millions worldwide piled up in silos. Crude iron that supplied some thirty percent of American steel makers stopped arriving. Roughly half the world’s supply of the neon used in lasers to make chips was taken off the market.
>
>But while Russian ships menaced off the Ukrainian coast, the small ports in the Danube river on the Romanian border kept working, offering a small but vital lifeline. Their importance continued to grow even after an internationally brokered deal with Russia stabilized the shipping routes on the Black Sea for the limited movement of foodstuffs.
>
>Now, two weeks after the collapse of that deal, the small Danube ports are the only shipping outlet for millions of tons of grain once again trapped in Ukraine — and Russia has made clear they, too, are under threat.
>
>“The Danube is our gateway at sea to Europe and the world,” Stanislav Zinchenko, chief executive of GMK, a Kyiv-based economic think tank, said in an interview.
>
>“The river ports are now so essential to Ukraine’s throttled export economy,” he said, that the impact of losing them is “hard to calculate.”
>
>Before Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Danube ports were an afterthought — underfinanced and responsible for just 4 percent of Ukrainian exports, or around 6 million tons of cargo, Mr. Zinchenko said. Now, Ukraine’s ports on the river — Izmail, Reni and Ust-Danube — are a vital economic link to Europe.

I know actually a bit about this 😏 i won't share too much info on the operation or who is behind it but you can probably guess.

I can tell you a few things about it - which are hilarious. people are tricked into losing access or sending money, once the money has been stolen, there are demands made in order to get back their money, they have to commit some crime or do something really stupid. 

There are also “advanced target” lists of semi important and actually important people on the target list who make perfect blackmail targets, ppl who are in a position to giving up something more interesting than just set fire to something. The lists are gigantic. 

There are really cases of hilarity in all this, some Russians are absolutely so stupid they are convinced of anything. One episode goes like this: there is a Russian who is now convinced that someone has been stealing money from their bank, they are on the phone with “the bank” (not the bank lol). They are instructed that there is some listening device in their house capturing the keystrokes; they are then convinced the phone call is now becoming some kind of localised detector, where they play a kind of game of Marco Polo, they are told to go to the fridge because that’s where people usually hide the device, they are then given instructions to throw the milk outside their balcony lol. 

I’m not even joking. It’s happened. only in Russia can someone be this socially engineered. If I could speak fluent Russian I would of involved myself but I provided a few target lists and I’m happy with that level of involvement ;)

Long range weapons are a hot topic in this country, regardless of the support for Ukraine. In fact I was surprised to learn that our Bundeswehr even have something like that in its arsenal.

According to German Basic Law, our military has a strictly defensive character, for obvious historical reasons. The Bundeswehr isn't allowed to have weapons that have primarily offensive purposes. E.g. ballistic missiles, aircraft carriers, of course nuclear weapons etc. and even armed drones are very controversial.

These Taurus cruise missiles must have somehow slipped thru, since from a military point of view you can't really make a clear distinction between offensive and defensive weapons. Most likely the argument was that the Taurus should only be used to destroy distant enemy installations (like airfields) from which Germany or its allies were previously being attacked.

Nevertheless, weapons like this politically remain a hot potato in Germany that no one wants to touch. I'm rather surprised that Scholz doesn't fundamentally rule out delivering them to Ukraine.",False,1690970445.0,t3_15fy92m,t1_jugk2yd,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

Namely, even before any help was given, a critical group of US voters had already decided that it would rather team up on the side of Putin. So it would be wise  for Russia to sit out out this war until at least the next US elections. Without all that, if the Republicans would just call out Trump the traitor that he is, it is way more likely that Russia would actually give up. Besides, I do think that most westerns just underestimate how important this war is for Russia. Sure, Putin cannot tolerate a democracy next door. But, there is more. Way more. They basically said it themselves. It is existential for them. Controlling the Ukraine makes them a big power. Loosing control and they will be weak. And yes, we all seek that outcome. From the beginning. Of course that aligns nicely with the future that the Ukrainians want. And in that sense we are indeed the good guys.

Do you really think he would attack NATO? I don't, and I think he knows he won't either, but he also knows as long as he trots that fine line of apparently internationally acceptable evil behaviour, he can do whatever, which is why the blockade was a nothing show because genocide, rape and atrocities are apparently ""A-Okay"" as long as you don't fuck with peoples' dinner.

The last tube artillery unit that’s actually seen service in the US military was the Paladin, first introduced in 1963.  They use air superiority and multi role fighters for fire missions, and the famous HIMARS for soft targets and counter battery missions.

35981fec250e860b664131eea1517b8e,15fy92m,jukjial,"Hi. Actual artilleryman here. This is beyond wrong. Like hyper-wrong.

Supression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) is a multi-domain task that involves the integration of surface to surface indirect fire assets in support of fixed wing kinetic or non-kinetic tasks to reduce, degrade, or destroy enemy integrated air defense systems (often referred to as IADS). HARM is exclusively for radar systems, hence the radiation part of the name.

In the simplest form, an air defense asset, once identified, is  targetted by surface fires that degrade it sufficiently that can allow a multi-role platform to conduct its own sortie before leaving the airspace. What surface fire is used (HIMARS, 155mm, ATACMS via M142 or M270) is contingent on the kind of platform it is and its distance from the FLOT. If the surface fire can destroy the platform than great! Doctrinally, the US assumes that indirect cannon fire will *not* destroy a target, only degrade or suppress it. This is largely why the US uses things like GMLRS and Excalibur rounds, their precision permits surface fires to acheive an accuracy close to but not as good as air-directed munitions. **Precision over quantity**

HIMARS was introduced because its air-transportable, which makes it far more useful to deploy quickly, while still being able to engage the same kind of targets as the M270 MLRS. Today in the US it exists in dedicated artillery brigades and usually facilitates ""deep"" targets, or high value targets that are operationally, strategically, but not necesserily tactically, relevant. Like ammo stockpiles and command posts.

There are multiple different kind of munitions produced in the west, HE is what has been sent to Ukraine for the most part but DPICM is in large stocks because its a) crazy fucking effective and b) crazy fucking dangerous if you want to drive around where you just shot it off.  It can be used for SEAD or counterbattery. DPICM *is* a 155mm shell, they all are, I dont think there are any stocks of 105mm DPICM since its base ejecting and the juice isnt worth the squeeze, (i could be wrong on that).

Let's look at a historical example. Most historians would agree, that the massiv build up of the Imperial German Navy was an important factor leading to the outbreak of WW1.

But if you read the book written by Admiral Tirpitz (the ""father"" of the High Sees Fleet) it was meant purely defensive and would even help prevent a war with other major naval powers, especially with the UK.

Tirpitz had a lot of very convincing arguments for his case. But we know it didn't work out that way.

The lesson Germany took from history is: ""Even if you don't want to attack anyone, a military with strong offensive capabilities can increase the risk of war, because your neighbors can feel threatened by it.""

Also:""You can't always trust your government to do the right thing, so better limit its power, including the military.""

Keep your shirt on.

From the Sitrep:

*The Financial Times, published a new article and, citing anonymous American officials, described the situation with artillery ammunition: according to their data, the AFU are currently firing up to 8,000 rounds a day, equating to 240,000 per month. Meanwhile, the US produces ten times fewer but plans to increase artillery ammunition production to 90,000 rounds per month by fiscal year 2025 (probably referring to 155mm rounds). This suggests a significant ammunition shortage, which likely prompted the transfer of cluster munitions to Ukraine. In the current phase of the war, when the AFU is focused on attrition warfare, artillery is crucial.*

The article has a link to a Financial Times article which is behind a paywall.  The Financial Times is a British daily printed newspaper.

The Bundeswehr has the potential to be a force for good and in addition to defending Germany help countries facing genocide and existential threats. Preserving peace in Europe obviously aligns with Germany's interests. 

Also, that guilt applies to the crimes Nazi Germany committed in Ukraine, too. As the German political scientist Claudia Major said:

>While Germans overwhelmingly support Ukraine in its fight, the hesitation on sending tanks reflects the deep ambivalence in a nation with a catastrophic history of aggression during World War II, and that remains profoundly divided about being a military leader and risking a direct confrontation with Russia. Opinion polls show that half of Germans do not want to send tanks.
>
>Those guilty memories are about a war against the Soviet Union. But even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Germans associated their guilt with Russia, as the successor state, not with other new post-Soviet nations, like Ukraine and Belarus, where the Nazis killed even more people, said Claudia Major of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “We did so much harm to the Soviet Union we can’t do this again, we say, but we equalize it with Russia and forget that Ukraine took it the worst.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/world/europe/germany-tanks-history.html

>Ukraine’s human and material losses during World War II were enormous. Some 5 to 7 million people perished. Even with the return of evacuees from the east and the repatriation of forced labourers from Germany, Ukraine’s estimated population of 36 million in 1947 was almost 5 million less than before the war. Because over 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages had been destroyed, 10 million people were left homeless. Only 20 percent of the industrial enterprises and 15 percent of agricultural equipment and machinery remained intact, and the transportation network was severely damaged. The material losses constituted an estimated 40 percent of Ukraine’s national wealth.

Yermak, said one person who witnessed the conversation, appeared as though he was trying to argue. Sullivan, this person said, “looked determined.” The exchange lasted about 30 minutes.""

There are more than 1000 ATACMs of various kinds in existence in US stockpiles. PRsM will start coming online this year. And far from being some sort of vital stockpile that can't be depleted over the past two decades the US has sold 10s or 100s of ATACMs to the likes of Bahrain, South Korea, Romania, Qatar and the UAE. So aks yourself that- why would the US be selling them goddamn Bahrain if they are supposedly desperately needed for US security?

And logically, what are the scenarios where a land based guided missile is needed by the US in large numbers in the next 12 months? Simply put, there are none. Any US expeditionary unit is going to rely on air or sea launched missiles for tactical support. The idea that if, eg, shit hits the fan in taiwan  would need them is just silly.- they have a large number of domestically produced and foreign supplied advanced anti ship missiles of multiple types. And unlike ukraine they have access to F16s and therefore can rely on more versatile air launched missiles as well.

The simple truth is the US could send 50, or 100 ATACMS to ukraine tomorrow with no loss of combat readiness- at all. And that would make an enormous difference to Ukraine, I doubt they have half as many Stormshadows and they've already signficantly changed the conflict.

People need to engage their brain and just be objective and dispassionate about what they hear the US administration saying. If their first stated reason for not sending tech is 'we think this will lead to escalation and we don't want to provoke russia' then all the subsequent excuses they provide are lies.

Whichever way its twisted it just comes back to this. The US hasn't provided them because Jake Sullivan is a feckless coward and his boss is too senile and timid to realise that and fire his ass. I wish that wasn't the case but it plainly is.

Truthfully I think one of the reasons Putin went ahead with the invasion at all even after his asset lost the last US election is he correctly assessed that Biden's national security team area fucking hopeless and would be too scared to intervene.",1690986543.0,1690986175.0,t3_15fy92m,t1_jugmt7d,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

On the contrary, this strenghten Putin's regime as historical evidence shows, inclding a research conducted by an Ukranian newspaper where they interviewed Russians supporting the war and you can find many former opposers or moderates flocking to Putin or not caring anymore because of the ""yeah, lets just antagonize all Russians and collectively blame them"" mentality.

Newsflash, turns out insulting people are not going to make them sympathetic to you, even if they KNOW you are right.

The ""pressure the Russian public"" angle is already happening with the econimic sanctions, the effect of which is uncertain but at least is professionally made by people who are supposed to know what they do.

That Germany carries the primary responsibility for the war is not controversial. The discussion between historians is what, if any, responsibility belongs to other powers.

As for sources from which I formed my opinion. In addition to several books written by historians, I have read with great interest the personal accounts of the people who were actually involved in the events. 

Since I can only read German and English, my selection is not quite complete. French and Russian sources in particular. (Also the tsarist government didn't survive the war.)

It's been about 10 years since I've looked intensively into WW1, so I can't remember every name and title. 

Some of of the personal reports I've read:

the monarchs of Germany and the UK (the Tsar is obviously missing) 

the American President and his closest adviser (Col. House?) 

the heads of government of Germany, Austria-Hungary, UK and the Ottoman Empire (one if the ""Three Pashas"") 

the foreign ministers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, UK, France and Russia (based on documents provided by the Soviet government) 

the German ambassadors to UK, USA, Russia, Austria-Hungary

the British, American and Austro-Hungarian ambassadors to Germany 

several German Generals, e. g. Moltke the Younger (published by his widow), Falkenhayn, Ludendorff, Liman von Sanders and Tirpitz... 

a Russian General in exile (who was understandably very embittered) 

the leader of the socialist opposition in Germany (Scheidemann) 

several reports from private individuals, e.g. the English wive of Prince Blücher (grandson? of the famous Prussian General) 

several diplomatic documents, letters, the Kaisers famous ""side notes"", etc. 

... 

After the war, especially on the losing side, people obviously tried to shift any personal blame from themselves onto others. Nevertheless, an interesting overall picture emerges. 

For example, Scheidemann had no reason to lie to make chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg or Secretary Jagow look better. Or the disgraced Generals to cover for their former supreme commander they partially blamed for losing the war. 

Nonetheless, all accounts are consistent in describing how mentally and emotionally devastated the German leadership was when all their efforts to preserve peace or localize the conflict failed and war broke out.

Cuba is for example particularily good at that, so is North Korea and China is there too. For example, Venezuelans revolted (and failed) against Maduro since it was a newly established dictatorship.

The police state in Russia is known to be exceptional, you get arrested for having blank cardboards, concentration of people that are nor even there to protest are dispersed.

Seriously, look at William Spaniel's videos of it. You need strenght in numbers and the ability to coordinate such in order to even attempt a failed protest. The conditions for protest existed in those Arab countries or wouldnt have happened.

It doesnt yet in Russia. But the war is steadily degrading the state and cracks are showing. Pressure on the civilian population is already there with sanctions placed.

What I can assure you will not crack the system is self righteous dicks thinking they are doing something righteous by treating Russiand like shit, on the contrary it strenghten Putin's regime as can be historically demonstrated and is also shown in a research conducted by an Ukranian newspaper where they interviewed Russians supporting the war and you can find many former opposers or moderates flocking to Putin or not caring anymore because of the ""yeah, lets just antagonize all Russians and collectively blame them"" mentality.
