He added: ""They've got nothing else to do. They've increased it [attacks] in the last few days because they are getting worried.""

**What does the data show?**  
In short, Ukraine controls 80.2% of her core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22 2022, and up from 80.1% three months ago. Prior to last year's invasion, control was at 90.9%.

Since the latest Russian push began in Bakhmut in late January, Russian forces have lost approximately 180 square miles of territory on net, despite some localised gains. In this fruitless period, more than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. As many as 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers have also been killed in this time.

🔴 Russian KIAs are an estimated 62,100 (± 6,200), with a 30-day average of 130 KIA per day, significantly down from February's 200 KIA per day average.

🟡 Ukrainian KIAs are an estimated 21,200 (± 1,200), with a 30-day average of 60 KIA per day, down from February's 80 KIA per day average.

Note: this territorial analysis and estimates of KIA both rely only on publicly available data and should be taken only as illustrating long-term trends. Week-by-week numbers are retrospectively revised as new estimates emerge.

**How is this analysis done?**

&#x200B;

**\*\*1. The Bakhmut Frontline\*\***

Within a day of making the decision, the Russians could potentially bring more soldiers into battle in Bakhmut. Initial reinforcements could include:

\- 2 motorized rifle battalions, each typically comprised of around 400 to 600 soldiers, hailing from a motorized rifle brigade.

Within the following day, they could additionally deploy:

\- A motorized rifle regiment of the territorial forces, usually consisting of 2 battalions (800 to 1200 soldiers).

\- 4 individual rifle battalions from the mobilization reserve, potentially adding another 1600 to 2400 soldiers.

However, these units are not at full strength:

\- Personnel: They could be operating at around 65-70% of their total strength.

\- Equipment: They might only have 30-40% of their standard military equipment.

**\*\*2. The Avdiivka Frontline\*\***

On the Avdiivka frontline, within the first day of deciding to do so, the Russians might deploy:

\- A separate motorized rifle brigade, usually a 3 battalion unit (1200 to 1800 soldiers).

And within the next day, they could introduce:

\- Up to 2 motorized rifle regiments from territorial forces, one with 3 battalions (1200 to 1800 soldiers) and another with 2 battalions (800 to 1200 soldiers).

\- Up to 6 individual rifle battalions from the mobilization reserve, potentially adding another 2400 to 3600 soldiers.

In terms of their readiness:

\- Personnel: They could be operating at around 75-80% of their full strength.

\- Equipment: They might only have 55-60% of their standard military equipment.

In total, the ""South"" unit's reserves officially includes:

\- 3 motorized rifle regiments from territorial forces.

\- 1 separate rifle regiment.

\- 7 reserve motorized rifle battalions.

In addition to these forces, there are Wagner units:

\- 12 assault detachments

\- Of these, up to four units are currently in recovery and considered non-combat capable, with losses exceeding 60% of their total strength.

Total Wagner reserves are up to 5k total.

What prevents Ukraine from doing the following:

1) Buy cheap android phone parts and drone controllers in China. 

2) use the same FPV drones they already have. 

3) buy Russian SIM cards in bulk via an intermediary.

4) put software on the android phone allowing it to relay remote commands to the drone controller 

5) put all the above in a box in ready to use format where all the user needs to do is power on the drone, phone, and controller. 

6) partisan goes somewhere. Finds an out of the way spot, opens the top of the box and powers on the components before leaving. 

7) minutes to hours later operators from inside  Ukraine power on the drone motors and go find and destroy a target. 

8) after the drone does its thing you can use a small explosive to blow up the phone and controller.

This whole thing would cost a few thousand dollars a drone. How the fuck do you possibly stop that? 

It’s just an android phone connecting to a tower. No one is near it when it takes off. Obviously you wouldn’t leave it somewhere with nearby cameras.

[US assessing potential damage of Patriot missile defense system following Russian attack near Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-16-23/h_cc3e58ec8ae626e6ae955ab1ae05b8ce)

> A US-made Patriot system was likely damaged, but not destroyed, as the result of a Russian missile barrage in and around Kyiv early Tuesday morning local time, a United States official tells C N N.

> The US is still assessing the extent of the damage, the official said. That will determine whether the system needs to be pulled back entirely or simply repaired on the spot by the Ukrainians.

> Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Tuesday in a post on Telegram that “a high-precision strike by the Kinzhal hypersonic missile system in the city of Kyiv hit a US-made Patriot anti-aircraft missile system.”

> Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday that they successfully intercepted all six hypersonic missiles fired by the Russians, but the Ukrainian military declined to comment on the Russians’ claim that a Patriot system was hit.

> “We cannot comment on this. We'll stay out of commenting on Russian sources,” Ukrainian air force spokesperson Serhiy Ignat said.

> Ukraine currently has two Patriot air defense systems in the country, one donated by the US and the other donated jointly by Germany and the Netherlands. It is unclear which of those systems was potentially damaged.

> *Some context:* Russia has targeted the systems with hypersonic missiles before, US officials told CNN last week, including once on May 4. That attack failed, and Ukrainians successfully intercepted the missile before it could hit the Patriot, the officials said. 

> But US officials believe the Russians have been able to pick up on signals that are emitted from the Patriot, allowing them to target the system using the hypersonic missile, known as the Kinzhal or Killjoy.

> *More background:* The Patriot missile system has a powerful radar to detect incoming targets at long-range, making it a potent air defense platform capable of intercepting ballistic missiles and more. 

> But the radar emission necessary to spot threats at a distance also makes it possible for the enemy to detect the Patriot battery and figure out its location. And unlike some shorter-range air defenses provided to Ukraine that are mobile and harder to target, the large Patriot battery is a larger and more stationary system, making it possible for the Russians to zero in on the location over time.",False,1684264865.0,t3_13iuf6z,t3_13iuf6z,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

There is a historical precedent for Russia needing to do this.

When Lockheed Martin's Skunkworks created their first stealth aircraft, their breakthrough came - from all places - from a Russian scientist who published a [paper](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0733203) about radar signatures on flat surfaces. The knowledge that Lockheed gleaned from this study led to their creation of multiple successful stealth planes

From [this article](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/history-of-stealth-from-out-of-the-shadows/)

>In an obscure technical paper in the 1960s, Russian physicist Pyotr Ufimtsev theorized that electromagnetic waves bouncing off a flat surface could be calculated and used to estimate the return on radar. His findings were ignored by everyone, including the Russians.

>...

>Lockheed and Northrop took distinctly different approaches in their development of stealth. Ufimtsev’s paper on calculating radar refraction had been translated by the Air Force Foreign Technology Division in 1971, and Lockheed engineer Denys D. Overholser blended it into his own work for a computer program called “Echo 1.”

>Echo 1, which computed the radar cross section from various angles over a range of wavelengths, was the enabling step to stealth for Lockheed. The catch was that the best available computers of the day could handle results only from flat surfaces. Thus, the calculations were spread out over hundreds of facets. The results were then combined to determine the radar cross section of the aircraft as a whole.

About 6-8 years ago, I read this lengthy article about how when Russian scientists go abroad for these conferences, particularly nuclear physicists, how they send all these Russian officials (FSB, SVR, etc.) part of them are to keep an eye on the Russian scientists, to make sure the CIA doesn’t recruit, and the other ones try to recruit western physicists.  And the author was at a conference, like in Vienna or Munich, and was talking about how easy it was to spot these guys.  The author said if asked, they always just say they’re from the embassy, and just observing.  And this is how nuclear physicists get poached, including Iranian ones.  Like everywhere does this somewhat.  But Russia and Iran do it way more.

(Ok the reason I remember it so well is bc during law school, my roommate was getting his phd in nuclear physics, we stayed friends, and talk every few months and he goes to all these conferences abroad and so he and I discussed this article, at length. And then we’d joke about it for years.  About the Russians being after him, spying on him if he talked too much to the Russians presenters, etc.)

But this foreign spying on own guys is what got these guys in trouble.  See, [their colleagues are upset bc it’s non-scientists who are charging them, who don’t understand](https://glavcom-ua.translate.goog/world/world-politics/trokh-rosijskikh-vchenikh-jaki-stvorjuvali-hiperzvukovi-raketi-uvjazneno-za-derzhavnu-zradu-927714.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui)

The issue with those Shahed drones was they were dirt cheap, something like 20ka pop, virtually any western air defense system is gonna cost as much if not more. Wearing down Ukraine's air defense may be the point, and if the leaked documents are accurate, it was decently succeeding. 

If theres one thing the soviets knew how to make, it was a metric fuckton of air defense, and thankfully they made a lot more air defense missiles than offensive missiles, so ukraine only now is starting to struggle, just as russia is running out (amusingly leading to the situation where russia is using air defense missiles as offensive missiles). Uncle Sam's SAM stash is also pretty deep, we have a lot of old missiles we don't use anymore that are just begging to fight russian garbage, hopefully that will be enough. 

There's actually a decent and cynical military case to be made towards allowing these drones to hit their civilian targets, civilian targets often don't hurt military capabilities, at least much less than possibly wasting air defense on them. Naturally I think Kyiv is well defended because the political difficulties from allowing this would cause chaos but its something to think about. 

Anyways, amusingly this strategy might actually work very well against Russia as well, it lets a weaker opponent layer the playing field against a stronger one, I think Ukraine understands this very well and is probably manufacturing such capability as we speak.

China and Russia's Scramjet engines block out some of the air flow going through the engine because they can't handle it so it slows the engine.

We know very early tests of the engine proved it can run at mach 8 and NASA has said it could potentially work up to mach 15.

The more they hit population centres, the more Ukraine has to spread out its AA. Slowly they whittle it down, as indicated in the American gov leaks (which might be mitigated by allies providing more AA). Either by simply using up UA ammo, or occasionally actually hitting an AA site. They also target infrastructure that aids them in the war. Eventually, if Ukrainian resources covering population centres atrite faster than Russia runs out of drones and missiles, then Ukraine will have to move AA from the front to the cities to prevent civilian casualties and infrastructure damage. If that happens, then their air force can hit frontline UA forces, which might allow a Russian breakthrough finally.

So far this hasn't succeeded. I hope it won't. But the relevant numbers are this: who runs out first (or hits a production wall that's slower than the other side's): Ukraine's AA, or Russia's missiles and drones? This is a big part of who wins this war.

That's why Russia does it.

The biggest issue in this equation isn't ever our bias, it's allied media giving a speaker to Russian news/officials.

Russia legitimately lies at least 90% of the time. Any other source with that track record that isn't Drumpf simply wouldn't be published in the way it has.

This feeds doubt and a questioning of facts.

While there are definitely arguments to be made about Ukrainian estimates to be a tad high, there have been occasional leaks early in the war from the Russian sources that corroborated Ukraine's numbers.

Allied estimates are by nature conservative.

We all need to consider the source and desires.

After my own guesswork number crunching I found Ukraine's estimates to be around 20-25% high at worst for Ukraine. I stopped crunching them late last year though. Even at such numbers, Russia is colossally failing.

I base my own estimates on density of troops, tactics used and rough terrain changes. Ukraine's KIA I don't have good guesstimates but would estimate in the realm of 30-40k at worst, maybe a tad higher.

Key point in all casualty counts is Russia likely has a bad KIA:WIA ratio, and Ukraine a good one. e.g. Russia could be as bad as 1:2, Ukraine as bad as 1:5.

When it comes to ground gained/lost, we can much more easily verify it given some time as it's questionable early and becomes clear within a few days.

At the end of the day, even on visually confirmed, Russia has screwed herself. But the equipment and troop quality we see in the field are strong indicators of Ukrainian estimates being more accurate than not.

Like someone else posted, this is also an information/propaganda war, on both sides.

They basically try to use the free and open values that enable minorities to have a voice to use against us.

Waiting to flood means having to keep troops around that area in case it fails. Even if it succeeds, those troops are not suddenly transported to the other (possible) fronts the Ukrainians could open.

All of these apparent disagreements between NATO about arming Ukraine with various weapon systems are for public consumption, no defense minister ever calls an accidental press conference and complains about so and so in public. All of these decision were made long ago behind closed doors and they develop a media strategy of how to get the public to accept the decisions while giving opponents and Russia itself as little chance to make a stink about it when they finally do.

And it works, last year when the war started how many countries were harrumphing about how ""Combat planes? Never!"" and ""Long range missiles, Ukraine doesn't need those!"" and ""Western tanks? We can't have German tanks rolling east again!""

America is the king of ""It's comin' right at us!"" defense technology.

Like that article in which Patriot intercepted 15 of 18 targets. Yeah, those 3 it didn't intercept weren't part of the defensive zone. Why waste a missile on a missile that isn't hitting anything important? It's less of an indictment of patriot effectiveness and more an indictment of Russian missile accuracy. I mean, why swing at a pitch outside of the strike zone? And last I saw, there's only two patriot systems deployed in Ukraine, which isn't enough to defend everywhere, but enough to defend everything in its zone of defense.

Patriot in Ukraine is a win for Ukraine and a win-win for the US. A) Ukraine has a robust missile defense system for Russian attacks, thus saving lives (granted, where it's deployed), and B) The US collects data on the patriot system to improve it without boots on the ground.

US missile defenses include *at least*:

* Patriot systems
* MEADS (the replacement for patriot)
* AEGIS (land based and sea based)
* THAAD (I believe the most capable)

Each of these systems has a different specialization - taking out missiles shortly after launch, in mid phase, in terminal phase, etc. And each has its own limitations. Each of these systems can deal with several hundred targets at once. This is the public information we have - and the US likes to underpromise.

Russia has less than 1,000 ICBMs from both land and sea launchers (some experts estimate fewer than 300), and less than 5,000 warheads. Not all of these are operational at once; not all of them are MIRV. There is no chance (or interest) that all of them could be launched to create simultaneous landings.

Everyone freaks out when I say this, but you can't win a nuclear war against the US. We've spent 75 years reconstructing our entire society to be nuke proof. Again, we have over 1,000 military bases around the world, we have moved all the industrial base out of dense urban centers and into dispersed clusters around random freeway interchanges in the middle of nowhere. Our entire population has been dispersed into low density suburbs. We've built transportation systems (interstates) that won't even be damaged by anything but being directly under the detonation.

The fact is, even for the nukes that get through, you would kill millions and destroy the glittering office towers in some cities, but you would not kill most Americans. You would hardly touch the industrial base that will come for you in the future. You will not even be able to hit every US military base.

Sure in the future there might be more flooding from rain with the dam gone but the most dramatic effects are probably in a few weeks *at most* after the dam is breached and the maximum effect is within a few days probably.

We saw that argument when Sievierodonetsk was lost. The reality is that Ukraine doesn't *want* to lose Bakhmut, but it looks inevitable, so they're conducting a fluid defence to allow for an orderly retreat. They're taking the opportunity to inflict significant casualties on the Russians as a consolation prize. But it was never the goal. The goal was not to lose Bakhmut.

Of course, the Ukrainians are smart and sensed an opportunity to attack the flanks - likely with the primary objective to relieve the defenders in Bakhmut and let them retreat or maybe even hold. If somehow they could turn that into a pincer movement around the Russians attacking the city, then that's obviously even better. But that's a longshot, and isn't the primary objective. There was no master plan to slowly bleed the Russians but let them take Bakhmut so Ukraine could surround them. The plan was to beat them at Bakhmut, and now the Ukrainians are doing the next best option.

In the grand scheme of things, I think these Pyrrhic victories keep adding up and Russia is really hurting for it. I think it's true that now their best case scenario is claiming victory in Bakhmut then freezing the conflict. They don't have the power for more offensives. I also think and hope that Ukraine's coming counteroffensive will be effective, and make even that best case scenario for Russia unlikely. I hope Ukraine can drive them out completely and trigger the collapse of Puty's shitty fascist regime.

(Note: You may assume trains are amphibious).""

  


stuck it in chat-gpt  


&#x200B;

To solve this problem, let's first determine the time it takes for the first two trains to reach London.  
  
The train that leaves Berlin at 01:00 travels for 12 minutes (0 hours and 12 minutes) before the train from Paris departs. Therefore, it has a head start of 12 minutes.  
  
Let's calculate the time it takes for the first train (Berlin) to reach London:  
  
Distance = Speed × Time  
Distance = 50 km/h × Time  
  
The second train (Paris) has a head start of 12 minutes, which is equivalent to 12/60 = 0.2 hours. So, we can calculate the time it takes for the second train to reach London:  
  
Distance = Speed × Time  
Distance = 75 km/h × (Time - 0.2)  
  
Since both trains are traveling the same distance, we can set the two equations equal to each other:  
  
50 km/h × Time = 75 km/h × (Time - 0.2)  
  
Now, we can solve this equation to find the value of Time:  
  
50T = 75(T - 0.2)  
50T = 75T - 15  
25T = 15  
T = 15/25  
T = 0.6 hours  
  
So, it takes 0.6 hours for both trains to reach London. Now, let's calculate when the train from Madrid needs to leave to arrive in London at the same time:  
  
Distance = Speed × Time  
Distance = 92 km/h × Time  
  
Since the time it takes for the Madrid train to reach London is also 0.6 hours, we can set up the equation:  
  
92 km/h × Time = 0.6 hours  
  
Now, let's solve for Time:  
  
Time = 0.6 hours / (92 km/h)  
Time ≈ 0.0065 hours  
  
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.0065 hours is approximately 0.0065 × 60 ≈ 0.39 minutes. Therefore, the train from Madrid needs to leave at approximately 0.39 minutes past 1:00.",False,1684241190.0,t3_13iuf6z,t1_jkcuslk,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

I don't necessarily disagree with your thoughts and I'm not the best person to speak to specific points, I focus on strategic and holistic trends.

Subsequently I don't focus on any singular reporting event but the whole subject.

If I had to pick one under-reported factor since Feb 22 it would be the surrounding of Kharkiv early on. It was an intense set of battles where Ukraine lost much and everything was at risk for the NE theatre... Sumy also comes to mind.

Mariupol stole the news at the time. I'm sorry I don't have more recent examples but small gains strategically often mean very little.

But as to a loss I would consider to any degree as negative as those that Russia has suffered it's hard to say as everything is perspective and expectations vs results.

In that sense Ukraine has 'won' just about every stage of the war. Winning battles doesn't win a war though, the true measure will be counteroffensives and to date, Ukraine has done exceptionally well.

We are about to find out how much this can continue.

For the future counteroffensive - there are many areas and strategies Ukraine could see success. My money is on the South.

The runtime cost of one system and the missiles themselves is nothing if it gets the US military data on the system's performance in actual combat conditions.  Hell they spend billions upon billions of dollars on weapons systems like the F22 decades before adversaries have anything comparable just to make sure they keep their advantage.  The US spends tons of money on its military R&D to make sure that no fight it goes into is even close to fair.  This is probably a good deal in the grand scope of US military spending.  

Every missile shot down isn't just Ukrainian lives saved, it's future American and allied soldiers lives as the data gets sent back for R&D work.  That's not even factoring in the deterrence effect of an enemy giving up before it starts shit because of the reputation boost this type of news will give American weapons systems.  Those are lives saved because the fight never even starts.

It's also the most effective advertising campaign possible for weapons sales.  European and other allied countries are going to be a lot more eager to buy Patriot batteries despite the ridiculous billion dollar cost because they know for certain that they work as advertised.   That will almost certainly counterbalance the cost of the expended missiles at least.

That is what they are doing and have been doing since the war started. Russia is not the only side playing the information war game. Sure NATO and the ""west"" doesn't say batshit crazy things like they do but they are still using media to achieve their goals. A big one is reducing the fear that Russia would actually use nuclear weapons, as unlikely as it is just talking about delivering tanks, planes or long range missiles. Remember how Russia used to threaten nuclear annihilation if the west delivered *any* of those? Well Ukraine has western tanks and long range missiles and Russia just muttered to itself and went back to crying ""see we really are fighting NATO"" to Russian citizens.

There was a time when Russia threatened anyone for trying to even deliver older Russian aircraft to Ukraine, now that's already happened and once again barely a peep.

I don't know what else to say other than do you really think that NATO allies actually debate these issues in public? That is all worked out behind closed doors. Once again press conferences are for the public, not other governments, their diplomats and military contacts already talked about it before anyone ever called a press conference over it.

And you're somewhat getting sidetracked that the goal behind the endless talk about delivering these weapon systems is about increasing over all support for Ukraine, these countries aren't intending to do that with these types of never ending back and forth, the conditioning I'm talking about is to have as few people as possible kick up a fuss about delivering planes, tanks, long range missiles and so on. Sure support was higher at the start of the war but what do you think happens if day one the US goes ""well we're going to give Ukraine Abrams, long range missiles, F-16's"" and so on? Russia and all the anti war peace at all costs type are going to freak out that the US is a warmonger and is escalating the conflict. Russia might even feel compelled to respond if it all happened at once. This long term back and forth totally blunts that, like I said now the reaction isn't ""Oh wow F-16's for Ukraine!"" it's ""finally they're giving F-16's to Ukraine."" (well probably)

Now why not give some of these weapon systems quicker?

Part of it was knowing they can trust the Ukrainian military with their tech and the other part that some people don't like to recognize is that any military really does have a finite capacity to learn to use and maintain high tech weapon systems. They can only train so many highly capable soldiers so quickly and they still have to fight a war at the same time. And maintaining things like a Leopard 2 or an F-16 is complex work, we'll find out after the war that they were being trained on these systems *months* before it was ever announced that Ukraine was getting them. I bet they've been training on Leo 2's and F-16's since last summer and only now have they been deemed ready to actually operate them and the spare parts and munition supply worked out.

Anyway the techniques these governments are using to lay the groundwork for announcements they know some members of the public or other countries will take issue with are very old, politicians and rulers have been using them for literally centuries. The means to communicate may have changed but the base tactics haven't. The best way to reduce opposition is to not surprise people with it but boil the frog slowly so when you finally do it it barely makes a ripple, or at least leas of one than it would have otherwise.",False,1684283317.0,t3_13iuf6z,t1_jkfpq6e,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

* not being 100% sure of our anti-missile technology,
* not being able to defend all NATO-friendly countries from nuclear attack by Russia -- including surprise attacks by Russian subs,
* NATO is not actually at war with Russia,
* Afghanistan and Iraq are recent examples of how not very good an idea it is to try to militarily occupy another country,

I will not put too much weight on that though, because for one US does observe Russian ICBM launches and so far at least their nuclear missiles remain credible.

The country with truly credible deterence is not Russia, but China. China is doing much better (especially corruption wise despite what redditors think) and US Intelligence estimates China wants to get from 200 nukes to about 1000 nukes. They have been observed building new nuclear silos and everything US has observed indicates they are serious and doing it properly.

 I first heard it in a panel discussion on the tv news, as *one* of the possibilities.  Obviously I can’t give a link to that...

I then recalled the [article that discussed EW and jamming](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/russia-jamming-himars-rockets-ukraine/index.html), the tweaking and cat&mouse game, from about a week ago.  And [initially](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13g6q0u/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jk13coo/) thought it was EW.

[This expert](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13h1zmk/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jk379og/) had said that the friend or foe system precludes Russian self-targeting.

Then, [this source](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13hwzuq/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jk7czaz/), who has contacts in the RF General Staff, is describing a failure on both sides (ie the aircraft and the ground controllers) indicating a double problem, compounded by a sudden inability for the air and ground to communicate with each other. 

A Russian source that I am unable to link because it’s dot ru points out that they were all within an hour’s time, and in the same region.  The takeaway for me from that was that it could be some sort of regional glitch.  

After this, I found the [statements made by UA](https://glavcom-ua.translate.goog/world/observe/chornij-den-rosijskoji-aviatsiji-povitrjani-sili-povidomili-novi-detali-aviatroshchi-927188.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui) to bolster the likelihood that it was EW, like this

> Ignat does not rule out that the Russians themselves are involved in the incident with the downed planes and helicopters in the Bryansk region. He suggested that the occupiers ""ran into some trouble.""

> ""The Russians have already commented on everything, they have recognized that it is a dark day for aviation. The Russians themselves have already told everything that happened. Helicopters, jammers, and an air strike group were involved, which had attacked Ukraine from the Bryansk region with guided aerial bombs. There is already talk about the third helicopter, so 5 ( aircraft, - ed. ) must have run into some trouble,"" said Ignat.

> At the same time, the spokesman for the Air Force agreed with the statement that Russian air defense could have shot down its own planes and helicopters.

> ""They admitted it, there is already an analysis of who is to blame, who they are going to fire for this, punish for this mess that is happening. It's nice to read such news from the enemy,"" Ignat added.

To me, the fact that he referenced jammers, but then says they did it to themselves bolsters the probability that it was EW, which caused Russians to misread their own aircraft, then subsequently target them. 

Similarly, Polodyak [dances around the issue](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13h1zmk/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jk315wb/), saying Russians did it to self, without ever stating UA had no participation.

Well, compare that to the Kremlin drone attack, or the St Pete cafe bombing—both were unequivocal, clear denials of participation.  

This openly attributing it to Russia’s self-downing, without addressing whether UA played a hand is exactly what would do if it were EW.

We chose this path because of the atom bomb. We are living with the consequences.

He also made clear that launching them with a Grad salvo was just a theory that made sense, not that it was necessary or something he knew the Ukrainian's regularly did. With the max range of Grad rocket salvos being as little 20 km with common types of rockets and GMLRS rockets being 80 km there are no doubt many situations in which you cannot launch a grad salvo with your M-31 GMLRS rockets because the grad salvo would land behind your own lines.

The M-31 GMLRS travels at Mach 2.5 and in a fairly low arc, by the time it is visible on your radar taking into account the travel time of your own missiles to hit it you have very little time to launch to intercept it. In fact depending on where your launcher is at it might simply not be possible to intercept it at all since chances are your own interceptor only travels around the speed of the M-31 or maybe up to mach 3.5 for most air defense systems. For instance a Buk missile travels mach 3, if your launcher is not directly on the M-31's flight path you better launch real quick to have a chance at intercepting it as your ability to close the distance disappears real fast when the rocket you are trying to hit moves almost as fast.

**TL;DR:** A Grad rocket salvo might used in combination with a launch from HIMARS to confuse enemy air defense systems but that won't always be possible, Ryan just guessed it might be effective and besides the mach 2.5 speed and low trajectory just make them difficult to hit in general.

Edit: For instance when Ukraine was targeting the Antonivskiy bridge they could not cover launches with a grad slavo because it would have landed randomly inside the city itself. Russia stationed air defense beside the bridge yet there was still video of successful GMLRS strikes on the bridge with air defense missiles exploding in the sky hitting nothing. So even with zero confusion with a Grad launch they're obviously just hard to intercept, at least with what the Russians have, another sign as to why they might have moved to trying GPS jamming instead.",1684267533.0,1684266917.0,t3_13iuf6z,t1_jkekfit,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Russian militarism is checked in Ukraine now. So the question for the European really is, how much more are they willing to pay.

They haven't even given Ukraine enough to take back Crimea, which is on Zelensky's list of wants so it's evident that European resolve is not as strong as you think.

So the question is where does it end? The only proper solution to all of this is go into Russia and remove Putin. That's a problem no one is even considering right now, Russia is a pot of shit but that region of the world is a pool of shit, and even a bad Russian regime is better than no regime.

Again, Patriot looks pretty good on both metrics.  It protects against large losses (A), and most of the threats it protects against cost a comparable amount to what the missiles cost (B).  But if the enemy starts to employ lots of $10k drones, you'd better find something better to do than to launch Patriot missiles at them, because if the enemy can spend $10k and force you to spend $4M, you're in an economically losing position, unless you can afford to spend 400x your opponent.

There is a reason that many in the military aviation community said that giving Ukraine new combat aircraft that they could use properly would take a year. If anyone believes they trained the Ukrainian military in the use and maintenance of Leopard 2 tanks in the little over *two months* between the announcement and delivery I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell them. Same for Bradley's and much of the other western equipment. 

> They needed this long to realize Ukrainians use their systems well? I don't buy it.

Not just use them well but as I said be trusted with the technology, AKA don't let this fall into Russian hands or have someone corrupt give it to them, and not just use it well but actually be able to maintain and fix common mechanical issues that occur. That's the reason M-113 armored personal carries could be given so quickly, simple 1960's tech that any Ukrainian engine mechanic can get a handle on quick, no complicated electronics. NLAWS, Javelins and Stinger missiles? Easy to use. That's what's in their hands a couple months of the war starting. HIMARS required some trust to be built before the US would sign off on it, they were worried Ukraine might use it in Russia let it fall into their hands, that's the kind of trust angle I was talking about.

> it's not really part of some long term plan

Militaries around the world *love* to make long term plans. They sit around for weeks playing imaginary war games, think of every possible outcome. Make long term plans for the maintenance and procurement of weapon systems and so on. And when the politicians come knocking and ask ""what can we give to Ukraine?"" the analysts present a bunch of notional timelines of when they think they could realistically have a weapon system up and running in Ukraine with the supply of spare parts and maintainers to make sure it runs and the skilled crews to actually use it successfully in battle. That does not happen in two or three months, that's window dressing for public consumption.

Sure things can change as new events occur but if Ukrainian's are driving Leo 2's in Ukraine March they didn't start training on them in January like they announced, they started training last summer. If Ukrainian's are flying F-16's at the end of this summer they didn't start learning to maintain and fly them this month, they once again started last summer.

Lend-Lease was also passed and this allows Biden to lend Ukraine weapons WITH the expectation that it is paid back. The important part of Lend-Lease though is that it doesn't require additional congressional approval. If Congress refused to allocate more funds for Ukraine then Lend-Lease provides some wiggle room (up to a point) for the US to continue supporting Ukraine. While Lend-Lease hasn't been used yet it remains important because it sends the message to Russia that congressional politics won't necessarily undermine US support. This is very important because the more Russia thinks ""the west is about to break"" the more likely they are to hold out. While Lend-Lease isn't being used to give Ukraine weapons currently it does increase the pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table by showing that congressional politics won't stop US aid. Ukraine isn't getting Lend-Lease right now because they have something even better than Lend-Lease.",False,1684278386.0,t3_13iuf6z,t1_jkfg24o,,6,2,0,2,0,0,
