Day 96 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today Kyivskyi district was shelled again, 1 person died and 5 more people were injured. While it was said that only Kyivskyi district was shelled, we are not so sure about it, because we live around 6 km away from that district, but we still heard the distinct sound of MLRS shelling somewhere pretty close to us. 

Curfew was also moved even farther back from 9pm to 10pm, now it’s basically the same as in the cities far away from the frontline, which shows that it is now a bit safer here, but shelling still continues. Seeing the likes of Lavrov spout bullshit about them not targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure is infuriating, while yes, he obviously only says lies, but even those lies hit different when you can hear that shelling that “is not targeting civilians” land close by, and then some people actually believe in it, which is even worse.

There doesn’t seem to be any progress in Kharkiv oblast, but those counteroffensives in Kherson oblast look very promising. Actually the biggest giveaway of those counteroffensives being threatening to Russia is their actions. Today they suddenly cut off Kherson from mobile connection and internet and started to play their propaganda on the loud speakers throughout the city. 

Their message is that the “Kyiv regime is obstructing the spread of objective information” and that they are “posing Russia as an aggressor and an occupant” Wtf? Lmao, are they even serious with this? What the hell are they if not an aggressor and an occupant? They are also saying that “Kyiv’s actions are inhumane and illegal” They are literally blasting this shit to people living under their occupation, what even? 

Of course they also said that Russia is “willing to protect the residents of southern Ukraine from Kyiv’s regime” and that they will soon connect them to alternative sources of mobile connection and internet.

>Between the Winter War and perestroika in the late 1980s, Soviet historiography relied solely on Molotov's speeches on the Winter War. In his radio speech of 29 November 1939, Molotov argued that the Soviet Union had tried to negotiate guarantees of security for Leningrad for two months. The Finns had taken a hostile stance to ""please foreign imperialists"". Finland had undertaken military provocation, and the Soviet Union could no longer abide by the non-aggression pacts. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union did not want to occupy or annex Finland, but the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.

Russia claimed they performed diplomatic action through the Minsk Accords, but that Ukraine violated them and threatened Russia militarily. Ukraine would have also joined a hostile foreign ""imperialistic"" NATO. Therefore the invasion was ""justified"" and Russia wouldn't have to abide by the Budapest agreement. Russia supposedly didn't want to annex/puppet Ukraine but only secure itself.

From CNN's Tim Lister and Yulia Kesaieva 

The Ukrainian military says it has begun a counter-offensive against Russian forces in the south and has claimed significant advances in the direction of Kherson.

Serhii Hlan, a deputy who sits on the Kherson region council, said on Saturday Ukrainian forces ""continued offensive operations and pushed the enemy back 9 kilometers (5 miles) in the Beryslav district.""

Hlan also claimed that Ukrainian units ""broke the enemy grouping into two parts and actually encircled the enemy grouping in Davidiv Brid."" 

Davidiv Brid has been on the front lines for weeks and became an escape route for civilians trying to leave Kherson, often under fire.

The Ukrainian military published video of artillery strikes, purportedly against Russian positions. It said on Facebook that ""the artillery war continues.""

""Ukrainian soldiers chase and burn the occupiers' equipment on the lands of Kherson and Mykolaiv regions,"" it said. ""Kherson hold on, we're close!""",False,1653887105.0,t3_v0rpuf,t3_v0rpuf,,0,76,0,76,0,0,

TL;DW Russia now seems to be laser focused on taking the town of Severodonestk. This seems odd given the relative lack of strategic value but it has great political importance: if the Russians take this town they will have fully conquered 100% of Luhansk Oblast. In addition this will allow something of a pincer move to cut the whole of Donbas off from the rest of Ukraine and cut the Ukrainians and Ukrainian soldiers inside it off from support. In the meantime the Russians cannot fully abandon Kharkiv as there are important rail connections into Russia that are important for their logistics in the area. And of course this has left Kherson somewhat exposed and the Ukrainians have called their bluff and begun their counter-offensive. It seems this week the heaviest fighting will be around Severodonestk, as Russia looks to capture all of Luhansk.

Arriving at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, he suggested the Commission - which develops laws for member states - had failed to properly negotiate the embargo with member countries.  
  
He said the oil ban had come “out of the blue” – without answering questions on Hungary’s energy security. “Energy is a serious issue. We need solutions and then the sanctions,"" he said.  
  
However, he also sounded a positive note about a proposed compromise that would exempt pipeline oil from any ban - describing that idea as “not bad.”  
  
“It’s a good approach but we need a guarantee that in the case of an accident with the pipeline... we have to have the right to get Russian oil from other sources,"" he said.

A short summary would be that 'The West' keeps thinking of Russia as the Easternmost part of the West, but in reality, Russia is the Westernmost part of the East.

They were enslaved by Ghengis Kong and the Mongols and learned culturally during that time that lies and strength were the only thing that mattered.

The Western reaches of the Soviet states didn't concede to the Mongols in quite the same way and retained some sense of 'democratic principles' and that the individual mattered.

Russia has a heavy authoritarian mindset. The top authority is everything, and the individual's job is to endure suffering to make the top authority and therefore the country great, and if there are any problems, it's the fault of the 'middlemen' between the Czar and the individual.

There's even still a public broadcast where the citizens complain about problems to Putin while he has all of the governors on television and he in turn lambastes them to fix the problems in a form of kabuki political theatre.",1653955490.0,1653952807.0,t3_v0rpuf,t1_ialhzzg,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Scholars at Yale Business School reported that more than a thousand international companies had curtailed or shuttered their businesses in Russia by the eighth week of the war. More will surely follow.
* A Closed Society — Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has hastened what had already been called the “Putin Exodus” of educated young professionals that had begun after 2015 (estimated to be 200,000).  There has been a loss of independent news sources.  Russian civil society is under assault with restrictions on internet and speech, where even holding up a blank piece of paper outside the Kremlin comes with certain arrest.
* Destroying Russia’s Standing in the World — Finally, Putin’s war has ruined Russia’s reputation abroad.  Putin’s strange speeches and laughable characterization of Ukraine’s president Volodymir Zelensky (who is Jewish) and his elected government as “Nazis” has led foreign leaders to question his sanity.

A lot of pubs, coffee shops, restaurants are working, the ones near my home are always packed. Shops are packed with goods, can't say we have some kind of shortage, maybe some specific products like gluten free bread or something like that. Salt is a problem, cause our factory suffered because of war and people bought it all in panic. Don't really know why you need 5kg of salt for 3 people family, though.

 Despite fuel shortage and high prices there are a lot of traffic. Public transport is operating in almost full level. You can still use undeground metro stations as a shelters during sirens, but now it also works as usual, just with longer intervals between the trains. A lot of people came back, month ago you wouldn't see so many people on the street as you can see now. 

Some museums, gyms, botanical gardens, concert halls and clubs are working. Kyiv zoo is also working, big lines every weekend.

Seems almost normal.


edit:
btw about zoo, I ment6it cause I live really close to it, and since the war begins me and my bf were really afraid that some russian blyat would hit it. anyway we have been buying online tickets to zoo during the war to show some support to them. we aren't going there (I am feeling anxious when I go outside, just can't do it right now), but we still buying tickets. so if you want to support our zoo you can do the same thing

Nuclear war time line:

1st missile launched from Russia.

10 seconds: another 1 - 100 missiles launched by Russia as per plan devised by leadership of Russia.

1-2 minutes: 1st response from west. Probably about 30 missiles aimed at pre-designated military targets with the goal to stop further launches from Russia.

3 minutes: First Russian bomb explodes. Then many more over the next hour.

3.30: if Russia has time, releases more missiles (around 5-30) as they see death coming toward them.

4 minutes: First western nukes hit Russia.

5 - 15 minutes: Further response from Europe and USA. Possibly 10-200 nukes in total, depending on the size of Russian launches.

5 - 20 minutes: European major cities including London, obliterated 

7 - 30 minutes: strategic targets in Russia gone, including probably Moscow and SPB.

30 minutes to 2 hours: somewhere between 50 to 400 nukes detonated. Most cities in Europe and Russia gone. Also targets in Alaska, USA and the Middle East.

…there won’t be time for comments.

Even the best case scenario of 50 nukes means the end of civilisation in Europe and Asia, with radiation killing half the worlds population.

Over 300 nukes means lights out for everyone, 90% of the worlds population dies from radiATION and the last 10% in the Southern Hemisphere die from the nuclear winter.",1653949486.0,1653949224.0,t3_v0rpuf,t1_ial7v2j,,1,-2,0,-2,0,0,

They were enslaved by Ghengis Kong and the Mongols and learned culturally during that time that lies and strength were the only thing that mattered.

Nah, not down with that garbage. It's just anti-Asiatic racism -- as if the entire Eastern half of the world only knows slavery, lies and strength. It also totally shortchanges the massive westernization shifts that occurred in Russia throughout the Enlightenment period with the Russian empire, which at its height was the most powerful land army on Earth and an influential member of the western European balance of power.

Much of Russia's decay was due to outdated Western European notions of peasantry. I mean shit, Russia's people were victims of hundreds of years of generational looting and abuse by predominantly Western European rulers who inherited or took the Russian throne -- the most prominent examples being Germans and Brits.

And of course it has fuck-all to do with the western brand of communism that found its home in Russia for nearly a hundred years. It gives no credit to the lopsided industrialization disadvantages Russia had to deal with while it was the target of Germany and Japan, or what would eventually become a fight for the survival of its people in Germany's war of annihilation against them.

Russia has an authoritarian mindset because it has been ruled by authoritarians who did not allow their country to develop when that development came at the expense of authoritarian rule. It has absolutely nothing with East versus West mentalities. The West has progressive minds in Russia to thank for much of its political discourse and development in the last 200 years.

Not necessarily always searching in nominative form. The search term translator is set up to translate sentences, so if it's smart enough then the search terms' sentence structure might indicate to it that the nominative form isn't the appropriate one.    
   
It's still never going to be as good as a translation from a native speaker, but when you're talking about search terms a well-formed sentence pretty much only matters if you're searching between quote marks.

> Half of all single adults from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador who have been expelled to Mexico under Title 42 have been apprehended crossing the border again. As a result, Title 42 has significantly increased overall border crossings. In fact, 1 in 3 apprehensions since Title 42 expulsions began have been of a person on at least their second attempt to cross the border.

> Despite claims that Title 42 is necessary for immigration deterrence purposes, it has actually had the counterproductive effect of significantly increasing the number of arrests at the border. That is because, under Title 42, individuals who are expelled to Mexico within hours after being apprehended at the border can simply try again a second or third time in hopes of getting through. Some individuals have made dozens of failed attempts to cross the border and been turned back under Title 42 each time. This increase in apprehensions has been seen most among single adults who are not seeking asylum.

It's a bullshit number.  There are relatively normal quantities seeking asylum inflated by the fact that they can try over and over again due to a dumb law being enacted in a dumb way.  If you're going to send them home, do it properly so they don't come back.

An [$800 drone](https://www.dji.com/mini-3-pro) is more than enough in a lot of cases since they can often fly pretty high (1000ft+) and are pretty small. In the event that the enemy even notices them, they're either shooting their guns at a tiny target, or wasting very expensive rocks on an $800 drone. Granted these drones have limited range of around 30min/battery (swappable) and 5-6 miles, but that's roughly the range of most basic artillery. Those drones also have GPS so you know exactly where you are, which means you can give GPS targeting to your weapons.

For a few thousand+, your options open up significantly which adds range, air time, altitude, and the ability to do things like attach grenades or artillery rounds to drop on the enemy. The same way to combat this is to use very expensive weapons.

You're reading a lot into things.

The serious investigative journalist and war reporter-types are always gunning for 'the unique angle', or 'the contrarian view'. It's in their nature. It doesn't mean it's reflective of the overall picture.

I'm wary of anyone presenting a one-sided view. I have myself been accused of being ""pro-Russia"" or ""Russian bot"" (which I'm certainly not, lol) in these threads due to my downplaying Russian casualties / attrition rate (by drawing comparison to the Winter War in which the Soviet rate of attrition was much higher, yet the Soviets still won the war).

Of course, I'm under no illusion that sitting in a trench being bombarded by artillery is a joyride. But Ukranian morale seems high overall and it's a big reason why they are faring so well. Military experts pretty much agree on that.

Also, propaganda doesn't mean ""not true"". You can show genuine expressions of high morale on video and then have it be used for propaganda purposes afterwards.

As far as more heavy weapons, I do wish that there would now be less restraint on providing Ukraine with equipment they ask for.  They want MLRS systems, give it to them.  Start training pilots on F-16s or other aircraft they want to request so those can be provided.

Its volunteer pilot, Nadiya Savchenko, was captured by pro-Russian separatists near Luhansk, transported to Russia and charged with killing two Russian journalists. On 8 September 2014 Amnesty International claimed that the battalion had committed war crimes, including abductions, unlawful detention, ill-treatment, theft, extortion, and possible executions. On 24 December 2014, Amnesty International reported that the unit was blocking humanitarian aid from Ukraine reaching the population of the separatist-controlled areas.

1) I wonder how much more banned trade there will be. It’s mainly oil. 
2) Russia had developed a way to disconnect russia from the internet. So they were planning on it for themselves. Not sure how much that hurts
3) sinking of the black fleet by nato makes no sense because it is supposed to be a defensive organization. Giving weapons to Ukraine (like the harpoon) is a different story. But if nato attacks Russian forces it galvanizes the people. Russia will attempt to strike back (justifiably in some respects because nato attacked russia). That will escalate. Probably will have some tactical nukes because russia can’t match conventionally. 

So no limits on hardware to Ukraine. But once again if it starts overpowering Russia then it gets tactical nukes in Ukraine. 

Dumping by China/India is less important to Putin than keeping power. If a tactical nuke can help him stay in power by wiping out a lot of Ukrainian forces, I think it’s on the table. He’s thinking short term survival. He knows he has to stay in power. 

Air campaign on Russian troops results in full blown war. With nukes because of the imbalance in conventional forces. 

Almost everything mentioned will lead to an escalation and more nukes. And once a straight up nato and Russia conflict starts now you could see Poland getting tactically nuked if many forces are being amassed there. 

This gets ugly. Uglier than now. And no one is going to be better off. This is why Ukraine isn’t getting all that it wants. Because smarter people than you or I, see that this needs to grind on and let time do it’s thing. Sudden swings in the fight may make one side very nervous and feel like it needs to escalate in order to stay in power at home.

""Another OHCHR report documented an instance of rape and torture, writing: ""A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence by 8 to 10 members of the 'Azov' and 'Donbas' (another Ukrainian battalion) battalions in August–September 2014. ""

Which it DID NOT. So I asked you if there was another report. It was odd that you posted the comment from Wikipedia, but provided the link for a report that DID NOT have those words.

>>Other documented cases appear to be linked to the military presence in densely populated civilian areas, such as towns near the contact line, and general impunity. A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence by eight to 10 members of the ‘Azov’ and ‘Donbas’ battalions in August-September 2014. The victim’s health subsequently deteriorated and he was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital[34].
