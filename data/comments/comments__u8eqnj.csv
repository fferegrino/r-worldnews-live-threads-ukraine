Day 57 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling continues as usual, and it’s still pretty quiet around my area. Two people were killed today when a Grad rocket landed on a civilian car, but it looks like nobody else died. Those MLRS barrages still destroy so much civilian infrastructure even when they don’t kill anyone.

While soviet apartment buildings are very sturdy and hard to destroy, there still are constant fires in them after each shelling. New official number of destroyed residential buildings in Kharkiv is 1929 out of around 8000. Pretty much 25% of them were destroyed in just 2 months, and that is without any combat in the city itself, just from being under constant shelling.  

Russian military research facility just randomly catching fire was pretty good, I wonder if the fire started by itself or did someone start it intentionally? Apparently that facility was the one that developed their S-400 and Iskander, so them losing it is great for us. And then the chemical plant burning down the same day was a nice bonus, I hope this trend continues.

Though the official wouldn’t specify which country provided the aircraft parts, the official said Wednesday that the US and other countries worked “to get them the parts they need to get them in the air.”

The flow of spare parts has allowed Ukraine to expand its fleet of operational military aircraft, despite Russia’s ongoing invasion. They have more aircraft now than they did three weeks ago, the official said.

One day earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Ukraine had received additional fighter aircraft to add to their existing numbers. 

But on Wednesday, the senior defense official walked that back, saying that Ukraine had not received more aircraft, but had in fact received aircraft parts to make more of their existing aircraft functional.  

Still, the official intimated that at least one country was considering sending Ukraine more aircraft.

Russia has taken initial steps — missile attacks, long-range artillery barrages and small detachments probing Ukrainian defenses — that may be laying the groundwork for a wider push.

So far, neither side has a clear upper hand.

Russian forces amassed near Izium have probed south, in the direction of the critical city of Kramatorsk. But they have been met by significant Ukrainian defenses to the south of Izium and have made little progress. In an apparent attempt to divert Russian forces from Izium, according to military analysts, the Ukrainian military conducted counterattacks east of Kharkiv, recapturing some small towns this week.

At a second front in the northeast, near Sievierodonetsk, Russian forces appeared to make limited progress after bypassing the city. Russia captured the town of Kreminna, according to Ukrainian officials, and have carried out attacks nearby in Rubizhne, which remains in Ukrainian hands.

Russian troops may try to head toward Kramatorsk from the southeast as well, from near Donetsk city, in an effort to cut off Ukrainian troops from two directions. Areas around Donetsk have seen near-constant fighting for the last month, with residents reporting frequent shelling.

In the south, Russian troops have been massing across a fourth front between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk. That front has been relatively quiet for weeks. However, Russian units in the city of Mariupol are expected to head there if they can capture the city.

> ""The Americans have been preparing for war with Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their power is declining. They no longer have the strongest economy in the world. The beginning of the end of their world dominance began with the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Their dollars are just green paper with a Masonic pyramid,"" Shura recently gushed.

> She's been calling the Russian incursion into Ukraine a pre-emptive operation for the last few weeks. ""If Russia hadn't invaded Ukraine, NATO would have occupied it. And it would have aimed missiles at Moscow. Our intervention makes sense. We will be safe,"" she explains her phantasmagorical theory to me.

> Shura repeats the slogans fed to the Russians by state propaganda. But she doesn't watch TV. On the contrary, she always reproached me when I appeared from time to time on Russian propaganda talk shows. Where she gets her nonsense about NATO, I don't know. ""It's obvious to everyone,"" she retorted.

> ""The war in Ukraine is a US war over the borders of the foreign exchange zone. It's a clash between the US foreign exchange zone and the Russian foreign exchange zone. When Russia wins in Ukraine, it will draw Eastern Europe and then part of Western Europe into its sphere of influence. Russia will be joined by Iran, Egypt, perhaps Turkey and Japan. Russia, with the most powerful strategic arsenal in the world and weapons that outstrip all other countries' defence systems, will be the leader of its own currency zone. At the same time, unlike the dollar-dependent West, Russia does not have to dismantle its system because it has enough resources,"" the Donetsk businessman wrote to me.

Putin gave the order to seal off the plant to Sergei Shoigu, his defence minister.

*In the first phase of the Russian war on Ukraine, the Russian navy largely succeeded in the basics of establishing a coherent naval strategy. It quickly established command of the sea by keeping Ukrainian ships from sailing. Once control of the waters of the southern coast of Ukraine and the Sea of Azov was established, the Russians began using it for their military purposes by blockading the coast, launching naval bombardments of targets both on the coast and well inland, and by landing boots on the ground with amphibious reinforcements of existing operations. Attempts to resupply Russian forces via the sea have been a mixed bag, with some success and some spectacular failures like the sinking of a Russian amphibious ship pier-side at Berdyansk.*

If Putin departs without a successor there's going to be violence as people compete to climb to the top of the hierarchy. With the war in Ukraine going badly and Putin looking unhealthy, there may now be a scramble behind the scenes to obtain as much power as possible.

Maneuvers that may have not been possible when Putin was firmly in control and not distracted, now become possible.

In Mexico, when a drug lord is deposed, violence often picks up as competing cartels try to move in on territory they coveted.

It's possible factories or research facilities burning down or seeming to be ""sabotaged"" are part of this too. If somebody's power base relies on a certain resource, destroying that resource weakens the rival too.

The murder/suicides may not have been Putin trying to clamp down and get more control, but a sign he's losing it.

The Estonian and Latvian parliaments adopted statements on Thursday saying Russia has committed genocide in Ukraine.

In its statement, Estonia said ""systematic and massive war crimes have been committed against the Ukrainian nation by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,"" according to its parliament, the Riigikogu.

It cited the towns of Bucha, Borodianka, Hostomel, Irpin and Mariupol as well as other settlements that were occupied by Russian forces.

""The Russian Federation has committed acts of genocide, inter alia mass atrocities against the civilian population. These have consisted of murders, enforced disappearances, deportations, imprisonment, torture, rape, and desecration of corpses,” the statement said.

Latvia's parliament, the Saeima, unanimously adopted the statement, saying it was based on ""extensive testimonies and evidence of brutal mass atrocities — the murders, torture, sexual violence and desecration of Ukrainian civilians, including women and children.""

US President Joe Biden, she said, will “have more to announce on the next round of security assistance in very short order. You’ll hear more soon.”

https://breakingdefense.com/2022/04/meet-phoenix-ghost-the-us-air-forces-new-drone-designed-for-ukraines-war-with-russia/

>WASHINGTON: The latest $800 million arms package for Ukraine includes a unique new item — the Phoenix Ghost tactical drone, a never-before revealed system designed by the US Air Force and tailored specifically to meet the battlefield needs of the Ukrainian military.

>The United States will provide more than 121 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, which are manufactured by AEVEX Aerospace, the Pentagon announced today.

>“The Phoenix Ghost is this was rapidly developed by the Air Force, in response, specifically to Ukrainian requirements,” a senior defense official told reporters. “This is a great example of adapting to their needs in real time.”

>The Phoenix Ghost is similar to the Switchblade unmanned systems previously delivered to Ukraine, the official said, in that it is a “one way drone” that is “clearly designed to give a punch” to a number of different types of targets. This likely means that Phoenix Ghost is a low-cost, single-use suicide drone that behaves like a loitering munition — flying around an airspace before ramming itself into a target.

>The official claimed to have “no idea” how Phoenix Ghost got its name, but noted that the new system would require minimal training for Ukrainian operators who are already familiar with Switchblade or other unmanned aircraft.

Update

P.S. Try to read the comments with the online translator, cause it is the good way to make quite clear  statements about what an ordinary Russian person really thinks about the current situation and war.

Spoiler: there is no mass support for the war from real people, not bots. The war is supported either by people who have been living in exile for a long time (I don't know, maybe it's some kind of illusion that it's very good to live where you haven't lived for a long time), or by the maximally brainwashed elderly.

Examples:

""Corruption is everywhere! I just can't get it into my head and veterans of WWII, Afghanistan, Syria are in houses without toilets or hot water!!! How do you sleep Commander-in-Chief?""

""This war is a bloody poverty tax. The vast majority of soldiers are from poor small province towns.""

""If you put them in jail for stealing and make them work it off, how many lifetimes would they have to serve to reimburse the people for what they stole from them?""

""The children of the officials who started this war, to entertain the bunker-owner, have to fight on the front line, because it does not take much intelligence to say nice words from stolen palaces.""

""Scaring our enemies from the outside they kill us from inside, but for years the motto of the tsars has not changed - steal and lie"".

""We can say that Ukraine is lucky to have a Russian defense minister. The man robbed the army of billions of dollars"".

""Even I do not want to live with my 12 thousand rubles (130$ per month), it turns out we are not human beings, and our children have only the right to fight without knowing what for. God, it hurts so bad”.",1650548947.0,1650543441.0,t3_u8eqnj,t3_u8eqnj,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Facts: 

1) Two family murder suicides of top executives (not oligarchs, just regular rich people) in 24 hours, one resignation of a Lukoil executive

2) Major, ridiculously massive forest fires across Siberia, specifically in Yakutia.  These forest fires are bigger than the fires across the rest of the planet *combined*, and are the largest fires ever seen according to local authorities. Yakutia is the largest country subdivision on Earth, with only a population of 900K people.  It is by far the most sparsely populated area on the planet. Oh, and also, it's been having the largest drought in recorded memory.   

3) This area is also an emerging oil supply area, with wellheads being built in 2015 and major production being started in 2018.   It's unclear how much the Russian oil industry relies on this oil supply, but the reserves themselves are supposed to be the largest on earth. 

3) Local authorities are claiming they do not have the manpower to fight these fires and keep them away from population centers and industrial areas.

4) Rossgardia, a military organization loosely equivalent to the US National Guard, has sent several large units from Yakutia to Ukraine.   These soldiers would usually be used in firefighting efforts.   

5) Cyber attacks from... someone... have been targeting Russian defense and chemical industries today and yesterday.  Not that much of a stretch to assume they're targeting oil as well.  Chemical plants aren't that much different than refineries or oil production. All of the companies where the suicides and resignations are, are US sanctioned companies. 

6) Russia, in February and March, had been having oil supply issues which they do seem to have ironed out. They seem to have quietly lifted the ban on international airlines flying into Russian airports for fueling reasons this week. 

7) When the sanctions initially hit, a Gazprom executive also committed suicide. 

8) Several sources, from US DoD to Ukraine, report less sorties by Russian aviation over the last week.

So Russia is in an alliance with Armenia. When Azerbaijan attacked Armenia in 2020 Russia played both sides and didn’t help their ally. Russia only stepped in when Azeris had won and when a RU helicopter was shot down. They enforced a peace deal in favor of Azeris who had won. In that war Turkey sent TB2s to Azeris to test in a conventional war environment. They were a massive reason Azeris won the war. So what’s funny about this? 

Well Russia is suffering from TB2s (tested by Azeris). Russia can’t get any Allie’s to help it (like how it wouldn’t help its ally). And EU is gonna ban Russian oil, which is something that could benefit Azerbaijan greatly. Also Azerbaijan fought a near peer in a conventional war with mostly similar weapons, and they actually made progress and win their war. Russia is attacking a near peer opponent with similar weapons and is getting embarrassed.

The former top manager of Novatek Sergey Protoseniya, his wife and 18-year-old daughter were found dead in Lloret de Mar, Spain, reports the Telecinco television channel.

According to the channel, the bodies of his wife and daughter with stab wounds were found in the rooms of the family villa. Protoseniya’s own body was found in the garden; he died of strangulation and an axe and knife were found next to him. According to Telecinco, the top manager allegedly killed his wife and daughter before committing suicide. The police press office confirmed to TASS that the version according to which the man could kill his wife and daughter and then commit suicide was under consideration.

From CNN's Julia Presniakova and Nathan Hodge in Lviv

The co-commander of one of the Ukrainian units encircled in the port of Mariupol said Thursday that Russian forces continued their bombardment of the city amid negotiations to evacuate civilians. 

Maksym Zhorin, co-commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment, said in televised remarks that Russian forces ""have not stopped shelling areas of Mariupol"" amid negotiations on so-called ""green corridors"" for evacuation from the city, limiting the number of people who can be evacuated. 

""Think about it, there are more than 100,000 people in the city, some of them under rubble, some in basements,"" he said.
""Many of them are in the territory of Azovstal [steel factory], there are a lot of children, a lot of women, the elderly. And today, while agreeing on a green corridor, the Russians simply cynically fired on fortifications, on shelters where civilians were. So, of course, the Russians cannot be trusted in any case.""

Two senior Ukrainian officials said Wednesday they were ready to meet their Russian counterparts to negotiate safe passage for civilians and Ukrainian troops holding out in the city. Zhorin expressed the hope that a third country could act as a guarantor for an evacuation agreement.

Ukrainian officials said they hoped they would be able to resume evacuations Thursday. 

""Today, indeed, a number of people were still able to find and get on buses, but they are still in uncontrolled territory,"" Zhorin said. ""And we can consider this evacuation at least a little successful when Ukrainians, civilians, will be in the territory controlled by Ukraine.

It is true that the longer they fight, the harder it is for Russia to pivot and make any gains elsewhere. Mariupol is a hugely important location for Russia's link between two fronts. A battle of attrition does no favours for Russia. 

The Estonian expert, who correctly predicted the Kyiv offensive failures before it even happened, was quoted here saying that Mariupol was more than prepared -- Ukrainians knew this battle was going to happen.

> ""Ukraine has experience from 2014 when it held onto the Donetsk Int'l Airport for six months. The area of the Azovstal steel factory is many times larger. Every possible war scenario indicated Russia would encircle Mariupol. Ukraine stocked it with ammunition and food.""

[Source](https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1516856736593891331?s=20&t=LI10pZO8BQpbmwJ3U5lNtA)

You likely will have noticed the uptick in desperate pleas for help, including food, medical supplies, and ammunition. It's constant and repetitive. Surely they must be desperate for help. But it's also very clear that Ukraine's Opsec has been vastly better than Russia's -- there is no doubt in my mind that Azov, the Marines, and the National Guard knew exactly what they were getting into when they began their defense of Mariupol. The claims that helicopters were sending in supplies in covert operations didn't seem too far-fetched.

But [Putin's recent comments about abandoning the Mariupol assault](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-1026-ukrainian-marines-surrendered-mariupol-2022-04-13/) now have me wondering if Ukraine was significantly more prepared for a battle there than we all realized, and that the pleas for help from the military members there were all designed to be smokescreens. It doesn't jive with the recent surrendering of Ukrainian forces in the area, namely one of the marine battalions (though I don't know if that was ever confirmed). If it is true that Ukraine planned well in advance of the assault, then Russia was never really going to take Mariupol, which is an incredible development in and of itself, regardless of what Putin chooses to do. 

I don't know what losses Mariupol has taken, I know their civilian casualties are going to be obscured by that incinerator, but based on what we know of Mariupol, it seems like the military losses in Mariupol are less than anyone is anticipating.

What happened today in Mariupol is from my point of view the biggest internal image loss that Putin has suffered so far during the war. Inside Russia, the imagine damage  that has happened will surpass that of the Kyiv retreat and will probably start a big demoralization wave among both ordinary Russians and the Russian military.

The fact that he is allowing the azovs and marines in the azovstal to live is a huge media and image blunder inside Russia. ""Denazification"" is an **OFFICIAL** goal of the Russian campaign which has been repeated by every Russian media outlet since the invasion began and by Putin himself. Both Russian official media and unofficial partisans have loudly proclaimed and hyped the so call ""denazification"" since February. To achieve denazification he has to eliminate the azovs. There is no other way. Without the azovs eliminated there is no denazification and hence one of the officially stated goals of the war is not being achieved. Everyone knows this including Russian supporters.

Every Russian telegram channel and every Russian media outlet for the past one and a half months has been blasting only images of Mariupol and Donbas to show how the brave Russian soldiers are dealing with the azovs there.

Russian sympathizers were anxiously awaiting for the Russian army to come out with the heads of the azovs in azovstal on a plate and present them to the Russian masses.

And now Putin lets them live to see another day? You can feel the hype being drained from Russian sympathizers like you can feel the air coming out of a tire that has just been punctured with a knife. This is the equivalent of a politician breaking one of his main campaign promises. This is literally like Trump not building the wall.

Not to mention the other things that Mariupol has influenced:

1. The genocide there has been a major contributor to Russian sanctions
2. By drawing troops from there he is admitting that the Donbas offensive, like the Kyiv offensive isn't going as planned.

Us here we are glad that the defenders of Mariupol will live to see another day, but for Putin internally this shows how out of touch he is not only with the military reality on the field but with the Russian masses in general.",False,1650561330.0,t3_u8eqnj,t3_u8eqnj,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

ebb0648fcbc0dccd480d54ec8eac431e,u8eqnj,i5m4v8a,"Maybe the following suggestion helps to think about military aid:

In WW2, a huge program was also put together with Cash/Carry and then Lend/lease. There were also extensive discussions about the type and scope of the deliveries.... and a ""basic line"" was recognizable: On the one hand, there is ALWAYS a need for immediately available and usable weapons. At the same time, the recipients (especially the SU) were already at that time not exactly choosy in what they could get. This emergency aid was important at that time in that it made units combat-ready on the one hand, and supported morale on the other. At the same time, it allowed them to cushion the collapse of their own production.

Strategically decisive, however, was the supply of goods and materials that were not direct ""weapons"". In the case of the SU, especially trucks, but also rails/locomotives, telephones/telephone cables, boots, combat rations (SPAM and the like), raw materials such as toluene, but also steel and aluminum. Why was this important? It relieved the Soviet industry, which was focused on producing weapons, while ""miscellaneous"" came from the Allies. What is interesting about this is that Stalin himself demanded guns instead of junk, but in the end junk had a decisive influence on the war in the East.

For Ukraine, I deduce from this: immediate aid ensures the short-term survival of the state, the country can no longer ""lose"". This is not enough to defeat an aggressor, i.e. to drive out the Russians, and the required systems show that Ukraine knows this. Without tanks there is no offensive. Ukraine itself cannot build tanks in the numbers that would be necessary (paradoxically, both sides only use old material), so they have to come from elsewhere. D can produce tanks, but not in the necessary numbers. Here the German Government should (and hopefully will) consider how to plug the requirements gap. Since money is obviously not a problem, why not now motivate the industry with orders to ramp up / rebuild the lines. In the end, I assume that in the face of Russian aggression, the numbers of units can be used/used even if they don't go to Ukraine. If the Eastern Europeans alone turn in 200-300 T-72s, then there will be a need for resupply that can be met from KMW.... The only thing is that production should be initiated NOW so that the first Leos are available by the end of the year.

I think some people here would do well to take another look at what has already been delivered from Germany:
https://twitter.com/CarloMasala1/status/1517031269611319296

In addition, Ukrainian artillerymen are now apparently being trained on the PzH2000 and associated systems.

And what are the others doing?

Tanks came this week from the Netherlands and before that from the Czech Republic, otherwise only the USA supplies large equipment. It makes sense to limit the supply to M113 derivatives in order to keep logistics simple.

Armored trucks effectively come from Australia and the UK.

All this is not being done on a national basis, but in coordination with NATO and Ukraine. In addition, there is massive financial support for Ukraine to buy new equipment or to buy used Soviet-designed weapons that can be used immediately.

And even the arms industry (surprisingly) is not solely interested in supporting Ukraine as efficiently as possible or is failing with its plans in the face of other NATO countries.

For weeks, the Ukrainian government has been asking Germany for appropriate Leopard and Marder vehicles. After all, they say, they are standing unused in the yards of industry or the Bundeswehr. But Germany refuses and would rather give Ukraine money for weapons orders. Checkbook diplomacy instead of tank deliveries - is this Germany's way of shirking its responsibility?

The answer is: not really
https://www.businessinsider.de/politik/deutschland/auch-nato-partner-halfen-nicht-warum-die-lieferung-von-deutschen-panzern-in-die-ukraine-an-der-fehlenden-munition-scheitert/

If you take a closer look, the situation is much more complex. Research by Business Insider shows that a German tank deal failed not only because of the political will of the German government, but also because of insufficient ammunition and the attitude of important NATO countries.

Among other things, the deal involved Leopard 1 A5 tanks, a predecessor model of the Leopard 2 used by the German armed forces. Ukraine had already requested such old vehicles from the German government at the beginning of March - apparently well aware that Rheinmetall and the Flensburger Fahrzeugbau FFG company had offered the German government 50 and 100 Leopard 1 tanks respectively for resale to Ukraine just days earlier.

But Scholz and the German government did not react, at least not publicly. For weeks, Ukraine therefore exerted loud pressure for Germany to finally supply heavy weapons such as the tanks - to no avail. However, until recently, Ukraine did not know what the vehicles were supposed to shoot with. According to government sources, Rheinmetall was only able to supply 4000 rounds of 105mm ammunition, and little more until weeks later. ""So much for the great offers from the German defense industry,"" an official tells us sarcastically. At the top of the defense ministry, there is talk of ""offers at the expense of third parties"" - meaning the German government - with regard to the arms industry.

According to information from Business Insider, the Bundeswehr also no longer has a significant number of ammunition in its depots. In the background, the German government asked other nations whether they could supply ammunition: Turkey, Greece, Israel, Brazil and several other countries that drive or have driven the tank. But they all declined - either unwilling or unable to supply, as several high-ranking government officials confirmed to Business Insider. Some of the 105mm ammunition is still in use, while others have been sold on to third countries such as Egypt. It is questionable whether these states would resell the ammunition to Ukraine - and how hard the German government is trying.

But the fact is that other states are also reluctant to sell their own ammunition shows that the operational readiness of their armies is sometimes not in the best of shape either. And that the unity of the West against Russia may not be as solid as claimed. For the chancellor, however, it is impossible to say this publicly as an explanation for the German position.

As things stand, the Leopard tanks, even if they had been delivered to Ukraine at short notice, could have fired virtually nothing. The same applies to old Gepard anti-aircraft gun tanks, the delivery of which has been discussed behind the scenes in the meantime: There is a lack of ammunition to make the main battle tanks useful.

In the meantime, Ukraine has also understood the problem. Government representatives are said to have now signaled to the German government that they no longer wanted Leopard 1 tanks. Thus, in an interview with ""Tagesschau,"" the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, actually spoke in the meantime only of Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Fuchs transport tanks, which Ukraine needs. However, the latter has not been discussed so far, according to parliamentary circles.

But there are also problems with the Marder issue, which has now been openly debated: The tank belongs to the infantry fighting vehicle genus and has no heavy weapons. The up to 100 decommissioned Marder tanks, which Rheinmetall has also offered to Ukraine from its own stocks, would first have to be extensively refitted and brought up to scratch. The condition of the tanks is unclear, not to mention the lack of ammunition. The Marder would not have arrived in Ukraine before the end of May anyway. By then it could be too late, should Russia succeed in its planned conquest of eastern Ukraine.",False,1650547950.0,t3_u8eqnj,t3_u8eqnj,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

What is the Crimean Bridge?

>  A pair of Russian-constructed parallel bridges, spanning the Strait of Kerch between the Taman Peninsula of Krasnodar Krai and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea. The bridge complex provides for both road and rail traffic, and has a length of 19 km (11.8 mi),making it the longest bridge Russia has ever built, and the longest bridge in Europe.
> 
> Having been considered since at least 1903, planning for the bridge began in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea. In January 2015, the multibillion-dollar contract for the construction of the bridge was awarded to Arkady Rotenberg's Stroygazmontazh. Construction of the bridge commenced in February 2016; the road bridge was inaugurated by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 15 May 2018 and opened for non-truck cars on 16 May and for trucks on 1 October. The rail bridge was inaugurated on 23 December 2019 and the first scheduled passenger train crossed the bridge on 25 December 2019. 
> 
> The bridge was opened for freight trains on 30 June 2020. A record amount of traffic was recorded on 15 August 2020 and totaled 36,393 cars.

a97a8ce135530f1b786117db088ed8e1,u8eqnj,i5l8sf3,"So some people have wondered, why is nobody from Putin's inner circle toppling him. Several reasons, I think, that I pulled from my arse and from having lived in an ex-Soviet country, next to Russia, all my life, as have my parents.

1. A deliberate weakening of military and oligarchs. With military, he keeps it so that no officer has an opportunity to become popular among his men. I'm not sure how it's done, but I imagine it's just cycling them through different units, and 'taking care of' those who manage to remain popular and competent anyway. Give military no one to rally behind. Silently endorse dedovschina, so no grunt loves or trusts his leader, and in turn, no grunt will trust him. Side effect being of course that the army will be good at two things: a terror campaign against civilians, and dying.
2. Oligarchs no longer have power. The oligarchs who were directly involved in putting Putin to power were pretty swiftly dealt with after when they realised that Putin's not going to be controlled. I think there was like one dude, and like 9 others in his circle. They all died relatively soon after. Since then, Putin has been playing oligarchs against one another, and making their wealth or fall dependent on himself. He makes or breaks them, and he lets them know. You will not find a coup leader within the oligarchs.
3. The whole state of Russia. Presently it's only held together by spit, blood and hatred. The only thing that unifies people from Murmansk, Moscow, Perm, Vladivostok and idk, Ufa, is Putin, and their fear of everybody else. If Putin falls, a succession crisis will follow. There is no other man in Russia presently enjoying the same prestige and popularity as him. Russian people are deeply misled and traumatised as a nation, but they're about as stupid as anybody anywhere else is. Who comes next will not have the gravitas or the influence of Putin. Especially if Putin is killed, this will likely see the whole country's governing apparatus devolve into a Year of the Four Emperors, except it'll go on longer. Nobody is stupid enough to take the reins when the race for the Führer's seat begins. Oh, they want to be the puppet master in the shadow, but the seat itself? Oh no. Except, again, a new leader will not have the gravitas to hold anything together, they will inherit a broken country, just like Yeltsin did. And they will end up like Yeltsin, except quicker.
4. So basically: as of now, Putin is offering at least a semblance of internal stability, but he has also deliberately or inadvertently ensured that he'll be near impossible to successfully succeed, because he hasn't given Russia anything but hatred and existential fear. No ideology. No hopes, no dreams. Goes Putin, goes the fervor, goes trust in the next guy, the bootleg Putin, the 'lesser' Putin. And that's why he's not been locked in his bitch bunker's bedroom and left to starve to death by his own people. Because nobody really wants *his* job. Nobody wants to inherit what he's created, they'd be fucking stupid to. Maybe Lukaschenko does, but Luka's a certified low IQ fucking moron struggling to maintain popularity even in his own country, fucking Colonel of Russia or whatever it was that he wanted to be. And most importantly, nobody wants to be the next to get shot to death because of the precedent.

So unless the fucker manages to pull a miracle out of his arse, regardless of whether he dies of natural causes or violently, what will come next is an internal bloodbath. Because that's what the man created. By ensuring that nobody has the balls to fucking try him or displease him, he'll have created a broken, hopeless, dreamless, broke country full of people bearing the same descriptors, and when you teach your sons that might makes right, then three out of your four sons are going to believe it.

[World War II Soviet victory flag begins to appear across parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-21-22/h_de5b5ad30159ad3d5d975d5707765b90)

Article- 

From CNN's Paul P. Murphy  
  
The Soviet victory flag from World War II is beginning to appear across occupied parts of Ukraine ahead of Russia's May 9 WWII Victory Day celebration.   
  
The red flag — flown over Berlin's Reichstag on May 9, 1945, when the Nazis surrendered to the Soviets — bears the Soviet hammer and sickle insignia with the inscription, ""150th Rifle, Order of Kutuzov Second Class, Idritz Division, 79th Rifle Corps, 3rd Shock Army, 1st Belorussian Front.""   
  
May 9 has since become a revered holiday in Russia and the flag an important icon.  
  
Russian troops raised a large flag as part of a staged propaganda stunt in occupied Kherson, videos published on Tuesday show. Propaganda videos published on Wednesday by Russian-backed separatists in Kreminna showed troops fixing the victory flag to a Ukrainian government building.  
  
Kreminna fell under Russian and Russian-backed separatist control earlier this week, Ukrainian officials said.  
  
The flag was also placed atop the regional council building in the Russian-occupied town of Henichesk in Kherson province. A statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin was reinstalled in front of the council building earlier this week, CNN has previously reported.  
  
Two European officials told CNN that Russian forces are feeling ""self-imposed pressure"" to achieve any semblance of a victory ahead of Russia's May 9 Victory Day celebration. Russia generally marks the holiday with a military parade through Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin.",False,1650516389.0,t3_u8eqnj,t3_u8eqnj,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

""Mariupol is ours!
 ⠀
 From the moment the city's defenses were breached, a similar outcome was inevitable.  The militants of the nationalist formations are firmly based in this city.  Before the arrival of Russian troops, the nationalists managed to explore every centimeter of the city, collect weapons and supplies in the event of a long siege, and prudently took tens of thousands of civilians hostage.  It would seem that the Nazis had foreseen all the options for the development of events.  They did not take into account the most important thing - our valiant fighters.  A banal underestimation led to the successive fall of the Bandera fortifications.
 ⠀
 Employees of the Chechen security forces under the competent command of my dear BROTHER, Adam Delimkhanov, who is responsible in the Mariupol direction, along with Russian servicemen and DPR fighters, worked at the highest level, the city was taken completely and irrevocably.  The entire territory was systematically cleared of nationalists, Bandera, shaitans and all other trash, the administrative building of the Azovstal metallurgical plant, which is of particular strategic importance, was taken under control, and the entire adjacent territory was cleared. The remains of the Nazis were blocked under a thickness of concrete and iron on the territory of the plant  and I'm sure these walls are the last thing they'll see in their lives.
 ⠀
 Due to the inhuman methods of the nationalists, our fighters periodically had difficulties.  The fascist rabble deliberately chose firing positions in the immediate vicinity of residential buildings or in the residential building itself.  Based on this, the tasks of liquidation became doubly difficult.  It was impossible to allow civilian casualties, but at the same time destroy the threat.  In the shortest possible time, response measures were devised and subsequently implemented.  Our security forces promptly smoked the Bandera dogs from their positions, after which the task passed into an easier phase - destruction.
 ⠀
 I sincerely thank every commander, fighter, volunteer who made an invaluable contribution to the liberation of Mariupol!  Thanks to your valor, courage and courage, the inhabitants of Mariupol are forever freed from nationalist oppression.
 I am sure that Russian soldiers, as well as fighters of the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics, have even more bright victories ahead.  After all, we are busy fulfilling truly great goals, and good luck always accompanies a just cause.""",False,1650564018.0,t3_u8eqnj,t3_u8eqnj,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

India is not the enemy here. We don't support Russia, formally not informally. We are business partners. We buy military aid, they buy stuff like medicines.

The only reason why our country has a huge gdp is because of our middle class which is basically getting fucked because we are basically running the country, atleast our money is.

There's clearly some kind of $800,000,000 limitation, because each aid package is exactly $800-million.

The thing is, artillery is soooooo cheap. You can give so much artillery for so little money, so of course it maximizes the supplies.

We gave $800,000,000 worth of Javelins / Anti-tank stuff a few weeks ago. It ""looks smaller"" than this aid package because... well... its physically smaller. Artillery is optimized to deliver the most explosives to the enemy as cheaply as possible. Its a totally different game / tactic.

-------

I've been saying that USA miscalculated. This is why. We should have been sending artillery systems earlier. But its an understandable mistake: artillery only works if you have front-line troops holding the enemy down. The USA's assumption was that the front would collapse, so we needed to send man-portable anti-tank weapons to support the cities / guerilla fighters.

That never happened. Instead, the Ukrainian front has remained firm. Artillery is clearly more useful if the Ukrainians can hold the front.

* Anonymous oligarchs question Putin - yet when you read the article, it concludes:  1) No serious opposition to Putin, 2) Widespread public support, and 3) might use nukes. Isn't that the Kremlin line?
* Some FSB / GRU analyst is pessimistic about RU chances. Gets into all sorts of details about RU military power, including their ineffective artillery. He specifically mentions how well armed the Ukrainians are. He does not mention the destroyed cities, war crimes, or civilian casualties degrading the Ukrainians. To me, it seemed his basic msg was ""don't worry UKR has this, no need for the West to keep arming them.""
   * Sure enough the next day we get information about Russian advances in the east, taking innumerable villages, Germany feeling they have done enough, and lots of aid announced and promised by other countries, but shortfalls in actual disbursements.

This would actually be quite simple for developing a cheap subsonic vehicle with low maneuverability, I still have a paper stowed away somewhere from college that contained simple hand-calc algorithms for sizing different types of planes based on their expected range, payload, service ceiling, maneuvering rates, etc. Hell, even as an undergrad I was able to write such a program for a simple sounding rocket. I just had to input the desired altitude and payload, and the software would output all the geometrical information of the rocket, including the internal tanks and plumbing. Sizing an aircraft is a fair bit more complicated, especially if you want to minimize radar cross-sections, but it is still well within the range of technical feasibility.

Manufacturing techniques have become so much more flexible in the last decade that you wouldn't even need that many constraints on your aircraft design. It used to be that you wanted to constrain your cross sections to simple curves like parabolas and hyperbolas, since subtractive manufacturing machines algorithms had issues milling along complex curves. Nowadays you can layup a composite skin over a 3d printed cast, or cast a part in a 3d printed mold, or even print composite/metallic/plastic parts directly.

I like an analogy of the Moscow dildo factory, if its a export market then basically the factory will probably have to shutdown once it stop filling export orders, depending on how much stock they have on hand. If they have too much stock then they have to drop price and restructure the whole business to adapt it to domestic only.  maybe exports only cover 5% of russian business (i would assume its much higher) its still a massive hit, plus transportation industries, ports, and supporting jobs, imagine unemployment rising pretty fast. It'll eventually domino, because eventually companies will report their losses and owners and mangers will have to respond.

Assuming that not every one of the stored units is operational, my guess is that they can spare 15-18 units and maybe 10,000, 155mm rounds. 

Truthfully, that's not enough to make the necessary difference. That's not a slight at the Dutch either, as they're doing what they can. But what Ukraine needs is 100 of these units and maybe 250,000-300,000 155mm rounds and the only way they could get that many, is if Germany and Italy would be willing to donate some of theirs as well. I don't see that happening. What Ukraine needs in terms of artillery and ammunition is as follows...

100 Panzerhaubitse 2000 (Germany, Italy, The Netherlands), with 300,000 155mm rounds. 

100 M777 (USA, Canada, Australia), with 300,000 155mm rounds. 

50 SPGH DANA (Czech Republic and Slovakia), with 200,000 152mm rounds. 

25 Caesar (France), with 100,000 155mm rounds).

25 Krab (Poland), with 100,000 155mm rounds. 

200 BM-21 Grad rocket artillery (from all over the world), with 2 million grad rockets. 

That's th3 kind of artillery power that could change the war significantly, especially with the vast usage of Ukrainian drones. 500 pieces of assorted artillery and several million artillery rounds.

* Ukrainians survive
* With as much territory and civilians, intact as possible.

There's a few rough edges here: should Ukraine try to retake Crimea for example? But even if Ukraine fails to take Crimea (or even never makes an attempt), we'd call that a ""win"" for Ukraine.

--------

In contrast, what is a ""win"" for Russia? Lets say Russia teleports a bunch of troops into Kyiv and manages to kill Zelensky and take over the capital (a serious concern a month ago, but no longer seems feasible by most military analysts). Is this a ""win"" for Russia?

No. The world is unified in what must happen if that unfortunate scenario is to happen. Ukraine would continue to get the support, a secondary government would be propped up behalf of the Ukrainians following their order of succession (vice president or whoever), and the Military command would also continue.

So even in a nightmare ""Kyiv falls"" scenario, Russia still hasn't ""won"". So what exactly are the Russians fighting for?

-------

The Russians seem to have rolled back their ""Win"" scenario further and further back. It seems like the Russians want the ""land bridge to Crimea"". I expect that the Russians can temporarily establish such a bridge with a strong enough fight (!!), but it seems impossible for them to hold such a position for an extended period of time (1 year  or 2 years).

------

EDIT: An important thing is, ""both sides can still win"", and this is the key to diplomacy. Ukraine can indeed call it a win if they hold the Russian lines as they are. Russians would complete their capture of the Sea of Azov, obtain their land bridge and call it a win. Both sides **could** stop fighting at that point.

However, with Ukrainian strength growing day-by-day, why would the Ukrainians accept that level of peace? Its a ""win"" for Ukraine, but they can ""win better"".

>The Air Force drone program, which was already under development before Russia’s invasion, matched Ukraine’s specific requirements and has “similar capabilities” to the AeroVironment Switchblade drone already in Ukraine, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday. The Switchblade, which the U.S. began sending to Ukraine this month, is a 5.5 lbs. drone that can loiter over an area for 30 to 40 minutes before an operator slams it into its target, detonating a small warhead.

The answer: It is critical.

We have seen the Ukranians use artillery defensively to great effect in this war, in fact.

Artillery serves three main defensive purposes:

1. Counter barrage. This is the most important for the Ukrainians. When artillery fires at your position, your artillery fires back to try and take out the attacking batteries. This can either destroy their artillery or at least make their fire missions difficult. Without defensive artillery, attackers can pick apart defenders at leisure from a distance, and defenders would need to counterattack into artillery fire to respond. This is what Russia has been doing so far, and is the reason for Zelenskyy's increasing frustration and desperation to get proper artillery.

2. Firing at advancing columns. In this war, we've seen drone-spotted artillery severely damage advancing Russian convoys and columns or new forward operating positions. Advancing columns need to come towards defending artillery which is normally pre-aimed at key locations (roads, bridges, key choke points). This allows defenders to slow attacker advances, allowing them to reposition key units and resources, and also can take a lot of attackers out.

3. Cover and suppression fire. When defenders are badly pressed and need to retreat or reposition, artillery barrages can force attackers to cover, allowing defenders to reposition.

Hope that helps!",False,1650553985.0,t3_u8eqnj,t1_i5mhp8w,,1,29,0,29,0,0,

Artillery is hard to use offensively because it takes something like 10-minutes for the M777 to be setup in the field. By the time artillery is setup, the enemy may have retreated already, or otherwise moved out of your expected position.

In contrast, defending artillery positions are just a bunch of dudes sitting around an already setup gun. When they get the radio call, they can respond within 1 or 2 minutes (depending on how good their training is). Not only that, but if the enemy retreats from their position, you've successfully defended. (So the gun is always useful)

They where the first states that pushed fast and hard to free themselves, so fast and hard that Bush Sr. didn't want to recognize them in the beginning due to the dangerous implications of a fast collapsing nuclear super power with ethnic tensions, among many other dangerous factors. 

3. Let's be frank here, none of the conquered territories of the Russian empire or the Sviet Union bear any live for Russian imperialism to this day. There is a reason there is a cycle of popular unrest and rigged election for pro russian strongmen surrounding Russia. No one wants to work with a state that regards everyone else as subhumans or serfs, uses every dirty trick at their disposal and in general has little to offer exceot oil, so strongmen are needed.

Technically, you could still consider the conflict on going as u.s troops are still in Iraq and Iraq is still dealing with insurgency, so the deaths are not done going up. This not mentioning those displaced as a result of the war.

Saddam was a monster who deserved the fate he got. If America had only invaded to depose him and help the Iraqi people create a more free government with no string attached, then I could say the wars are completely different, but that was not the goal. The goal was to create a u.s dependent state in the middle east and to gain access to Iraq's then nationalized oil industry. Everything else was just a prerequisite or a way of manufacturing consent for that.

Sure, u.s troops were far more well behaved (still alot of fucked up shit happened), but between the drone war and the insurgency that occured as a result of the u.s invasion, hundreds of thousands of people died, millions were displaced, and the country is still not at peace.

I can say the u.s invasion of Iraq was ""better"" in nominal terms then Russia's invasion of ukraine. For example, the u.s disposed a horrible dictator while Russia is trying to overthrow a democratically elected government. The United States was fine with Iraq maintaining its sovereignty so long as its government aligned with u.s interests while Russia would likely dissolve Ukraine or put in a pure puppet government, the u.s actively avoided killing civilians (though exceptions were made to this rule and accidents occured alot, that's war) and Russia purposefully targets civilians, the differences go on.

 However, I can actively say neither is a good thing in the end, both are imperialism, both are illegal wars, neither needed to happen, both were for selfish reasons, and thousands of people are dead and millions displaced because of them. Performing a more human version of imperialism is not something a country should be commended or forgiven for.

You can support a country in some things while not supporting it in other things, and you can be critical of a country in some things while not doing so for other things. The world's really really fucking grey and few things have easy answers. What I hope we can all agree on though is that Putin can choke to death on a horse cock and so can Dick Cheney and GWB and fuck anybody who uses other nations imperialist actions to justify other nations imperialist actions. If you do that, you have no morals beyond ""it's fine when my side does it"".",False,1650526480.0,t3_u8eqnj,t1_i5kysfe,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Poroshenko was the newly elected president, and there was no signs that his government was any less corrupt than the previous one (a problem still rearing its head now when you hear about traitors and mafias).

The trigger for the conflict was the ousting of yanukovich after the euromaidan protests. Putin did not have the forces staged to do a full blown invasion (see how many weeks it took to stage troops at the border since December) or didn't believe a full invasion was necessary, so it did a quick assault using local pro russians and garrisons from Russian bases after which a ceasefire was quickly agreed to. 

Ukraine, a fresh and unstable government, could not get help from any other countries as that would risk expanding the conflict and break the ceasefire. Therefore no country would send weapons.

8 years later the situation is different. Ukraine has been given training and military guidance and it leans to the west the furthest it has ever been. The government has displayed stability for the most part, and integrity (remember the quid pro quo incident that got trump impeached? Biden remembers…). and most importantly, they have pushed back the Russians giving other countries more confidence in their support.

* Ukraine says ""Repay or else"". 

* Russia then says: ""Or else what?""

Ukraine needs the ""or else what"" figured out. If its just ""USA / Europe will keep sanctions on"", Russia will do the calculus and easily conclude that sanctions are cheaper than reparations.

Reparations worked (in the short term) vs Germany in WW1 because Germany surrendered. In the long term, it just caused Hitler to rise in political power and led towards WW2. I'm honestly not seeing Russia pay for this unless a proper invasion of Russia happens somehow (and even then: that just risks a WW2-like event of Russia rising up as a military power 30 years from now to take revenge upon the world).",False,1650521765.0,t3_u8eqnj,t1_i5l2ptm,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Ukraine would have to push to save Mariupol and they just dont have the resources without giving up Kyiv. I could be wrong about that as I don't really know their logistics or numbers in depth, but if they were going to save Mariupol now would be the time and there appears to be no real ability/attempt to do so.

Sanctions will only further isolate Russia from the West and lead to increased trade within Asia.

China is probably the big winner here. While Russia will have gained important territory while foibling NATO's 30 year attempt to destroy them. So for Russia it will be a bit of a Pyrrhic victory but a victory, while EU is ultimately the loser due to oil supply issues.  US is largely unaffected, although could see increased European dependence on trade.

I guess the caveat is still Ukraine's ability to wage long term resistance. Can Ukraine win a Guerrilla war over the next generation over control of Crimea and Donbas?

It is not only the vehicles themselves, but also the spare parts and personnel trained to maintain these vehicles. Leopard 2 tanks are hardly ever produced from scratch, but only upgraded. To produce a Boxer or Puma takes time and the maintenance can only be done by absolute specialists.

No matter how you look at it, we have now reached a point where we have to distinguish between immediate aid and the organization of sustainable, victorious follow-up solutions. It is precisely the latter that must now be addressed. We have to agree with the UKR on what they want and what is basically producible (not immediately deliverable), and then the assembly lines in the west have to be started up in three shifts.

In that case, the best solution is to procure used M1s from the USA: cheap, available, another user state in Poland, definitely better than anything the Ukrainian and Russian forces have now. Almost 400 M1s from the USMC are currently being decommissioned.

Which country in its right mind will order a Leo2 in the future if it can't be sure that the manufacturer (aka the country of origin) is not willing to keep the expensive tank running? It could be that the SPD is in power in the country of origin, or that the potential opponent is the biggest energy supplier of the tank country of origin, or that the country of origin is of the opinion that the tank cannot be operated anyway...

Maybe if there is a certain obligation between buyer and seller via Art 5 NATO contract, but otherwise I would always buy the M1.

We don't produce enough Leopard 2s here and the M1A2 SEPv3 is in no way inferior to the Leopard 2, the Abrams never was (same origin, similar cycles etc.). With 400 Abrams from the USMC or even from other stocks, one would get an army equipped that is unparalleled in Eastern Europe. In the long run, Ukraine cannot feel the advantage of having a mix in its equipment pool like the Poles: T-72 Twardy, Leopard 2A4, 2A5, 2PL and Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 (which replaces the Twardys). The T-64 is completely without future and after the war they should be largely used up. T-72A and sub variants as well as T-80 are also all obsolete. At most, it makes sense to think of reuses: pioneer tanks of all kinds or chassis for SPAAG and SPG. With something like that, you can keep your own industry in the game, but that's about it.

Fuchs is now a barely supplyable multivariant clusterfuck, Marder is cannibalized within the force to ensure eFP and VJTF; they have stopped planned retirements to still be able to generate the necessary spares. Boxers were never enough, Leopard 2, the Bw is just in the middle of the retrofit/upgrade dip... the whole Bw had just under 300 on the books over the last 10 years, about 170 in the available inventory, of which 100 were operational, of which 50+ were at eFP/VJTF and the remaining 50 or so for training/exercise at the school and in 6 PzBtl to put numbers to the whole drama, Puma ... no comment... with luck in strength 2 Btl operationally available, almost everything booked for NATO.

A few other arguments, in addition to soldiers' behavior:

* The US never said the Iraqi's, etc. don't have an identity of their own, unlike Russia who denies Ukrainians are a separate nation. 
* The US never had intentions to annex any areas or change ethnic makeup, unlike Russia who deports anti-Russian Ukrainians through filtration camps, organizes fake votes, etc. 
* The US does not force genocidal or dictatorial symbols - unlike Russians who are raising communist banners, who restored the statue of Lenin, etc. as they claim Ukraine's destruction of such symbols violates their historic WW2 legacy. You don't see the US putting up KKK banners or confederate flags in areas they took over. 
* Ukrainian elections were free and they are rallying behind their president, unlike those other countries who were basically dictatorships. Compare the Afghan president who was first to run, and how the US predicted Kabul would fall in 3 months, a few days before Taliban takeover.

""Upon suffering a stroke in 1975, Brezhnev's ability to lead the Soviet Union was significantly compromised. As his ability to define Soviet foreign policy weakened, the General Secretary increasingly deferred to the opinions of a hardline brain trust comprising KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov, longtime Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, and Defense Minister Andrei Grechko (who was succeeded by Dmitriy Ustinov in 1976).[128][129]

The Ministry of Health kept doctors by Brezhnev's side at all times, and Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive. Even though there was an increasing number of officials who were frustrated with his policies, no one in the regime wanted to risk a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death.[130] Western commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.[131]""",False,1650583316.0,t3_u8eqnj,t1_i5ohc72,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

They are now effectively funded by Europe and the US, and they are increasingly getting equipped by them. And thats not to say they dont have a ton of military equipment themselves, because they do. So while Russia may think they can declare Mariupol and parts of Donbas as a victory, then freeze the conflict, it would take Ukraine being willing to. If not Russia would have to face continued large scale warfare from Ukraine. Now what has the last 2 months shown you about Ukrainians willingness to fight? So far, Ukraine has gotten a few billion in support. The EU are working on a 50 billion package for the next installment. Noone wants to drop Russian sanctions, they are negotiating to increase them instead. Strangling oil first, then gas. So for this to work as you think it will, Ukraine would have to want to stop fighting. A country with a fighting spirit that has awed the world, that is getting full-funded for war, rapidly increasing and continous weapon deliveries, that has already had massive victories against Russia, that is losing far less troops and equipment than Russia, that has everything to gain by continuing to fight and that will gain an EU membership with guaranteed rebuilding support and rapid economic growth if they win. If you think a stalemate like the last 8 years in Donbas can happend again, you havent paid attention. That was under a deal where both sides were supposed to withdraw heavy weaponry from the frontlines, and only Ukraine adhered to it properly. Now they can use every weapon type in their arsenal, and the Nagorno-Karaback war proved decisively how little viable a fixed frontline to stall an enemy is in the age of drones. 

&nbsp;

This is only going to go one way. Russia will continue to bleed, with no ability to replenish equipment losses. Ukraine will be continously supported by 2 continents worth of economy and war production and inevitably the cost to Russia will lead to inner turmoil.

We know that the Russians have lost a lot to try and take Mariupol, and any forces that come put of that to try and reinforce other areas such as the donbass will likely be nothing more than a broken token force.

If this was a month ago, I would have agreed with you, but every time the Russians seem likely they've learned from their mistake and are about to out maneuver the Ukrainians, the Russians fuck it up. Even this offensive on donbass is stagnating, because they didn't take the time to regroup like they should have.

The Russians are outnumbered, they're being out-maneuvered, and they're suffering from extremely low morale due to heavy losses and lack of coordination.

I also never really mentioned Russia's sanctions situation, all I said was that Ukraine will demand frozen Russian assets be given to Ukraine, which Zelensky has mentioned before.

There is also a HUGE change to the statusquo, as NATO is set to expand, and further stretch Russian forces. There is nothing to indicate that Russia's current occupation of newly gained territory is permanent, and indeed they're seeing problems already as the Ukrainians are pushing into Kherson (which was temporarily halted due to the Russian Donbass offensive).

While Russian offensives seem to be taking smaller towns with great difficulty, Ukrainian counter offensives seem to be targeting larger towns and cities with relative success.

Mariupol may fall, and I fully expect it to, but it's probably gonna be temporary.

Also, I'd like to mention that there are also massive holes in the territory that Russians have taken, which the Ukrainians have been exploiting to ambush Russian forces, or get supplies across to vital areas.

Nah. Ukraine only has to kill Russia's soldiers to prevent Russia from entering another war of conquest. This Ukrainian war itself is preventing Russia from being able to start any other war of conquest for another few decades.

How long will it take for Russia to replace the 3000 vehicles and 40,000+ soldiers (killed and wounded), and 1000+ missiles used in Ukraine? Especially if they remain in a sanctioned state?

If Russia was unable to take Ukraine with 170,000 soldiers and 10,000 tanks, why would they try again with 130,000 soldiers and 7000 tanks? At a bare minimum, Russia needs to build forces back up to pre-war levels (ie: 170,000 soldiers and 10,000 tanks again).

I had a looooong story written out, but it's difficult to source because so much of what my opinion is came from personal experience and watching defense lawyers dealing with Harris and her office pulling every sort of unethical trick you could name. Missing and even fabricating evidence, suborning obvious police perjury, shopping judges for specific hearings, changing charging documents at the last minute, etc. You really can't get an appreciation for what her office pulled unless you were there watching it. And granted, every field has it's bastards and assholes, but then there are the bastards and assholes whose corruption spreads over everything they touch. Harris was that kind of bastard. if you happen to know any CA defense lawyers who practiced during the 2000s, ask them about her and be prepared to buy drinks.

If there's any one specific thing, I'd point to the current debate in California over bail reform. 

Harris was notorious as a DA in the 90s and early 2000s for pushing punitive bail conditions for defendants - but not any defendants... just the ones who obviously couldn't afford it. If a defendant with only a misdemeanor or minor felony charge had money to make bail and hire an attorney, she'd just drop the charges... and why? To preserve her conviction rate. Because people who can't make bail and only get a public defender get desperate, and they take bad plea bargains.

Her high conviction rate led to her getting attention as a ""tough-on-crime prosecutor"" and moving up in the office, so other DAs copied her tactics. By the time she was AG, her coercive bail practices were unofficial policy of the entire state.

However, by the same time she became AG, the California prison system had grown by millions of inmates since 1990, and aside from the human cost, people started to notice that what they called a ""justice"" system had little or nothing to do with justice, but seemed to have a lot to do with who had money. Poor people were jailed for years for minor offenses, while rich defendants walked with all charges dropped before the first hearing.

So what did Harris do? She called for a repeal of marijuana convictions, and she started a political media campaign to present herself as a ""progressive prosecutor"". It was a particularly twisted and sick joke... literally like watching an arsonist claim heroism for throwing a tiny bucket of water on a huge conflagration they started.

And granted, I know that no one person is fully culpable for a problem like what has happened to the CA legal system over the past three decades, but there are few if any people whose contributions were more individually damaging than Harris's were, and I don't believe for a second she cares in the slightest about any of the lives she destroyed.

The night of the announcement of her nomination for VP, I exchanged a few txts from my IP friends in CA.

We all know (and he knows it I guess too) that it's helpless. Putin keeps rabbling over middle age propaganda and borders of Russia from their former Empire like a true mad man. It's laughable at this point to even start a discussion.  


Thing is, any piece of intel, discussion, diplomacy winning has some value. Of course it's totally infuriating to picture anyone dealing with this murderer. However what will happen if this end one way or another?  


We all agree in France that US intel was incredibly beneficial and helped traumendously especially with this new method of calling thing out publically. My point is that there's no right way to solve this puzzle that will most likely settle in months, or maybe years and we will have to deal with all the possible outcomes anyway, we cannot just consider to be at war with Russia as long as we don't crush this empire it would not be realistic to think so.  


 So yeah, from the US standpoint calling Putin a genocider, butcher, war criminal makes sense since he needs to get called that way. But if Europe takes this rout too, the whole dialogue can be seen as ""good vs evil"" and on the world checker right now we as western people are not that popular unfortunately. China, Africa, or Arabic countries are frankly not backing us out. Keeping a somewhat ""reserved"" stance helps in not pushing everyone in the arms of this kind of countries.   


And no, Macron is not helping Putin. He is trying his best in Europe to stay focused toward sanctionning as quickly and firmly as possible Russia. He is fighting to cut gas and oil imports while Germany, or Czechs desperately needs it. There's no ""one good way to fight this and anything else is helping the ennemy"".  


Once and if Putin is gone, if everyone turn their back to that country, what will happen? Europe can't just ignore this massive nuclear and military power that every decades or so pushes for exactions and killings outside his boundaries.

1) People in such top positions, which these guys held, are extremely stress-resistant. In Russia, if you want to survive in general you need only two main qualities: Patience and Stress-resistance. Probably a typical non-Russian businessman could really ""break down"" in such a situation and make a decision like that. In our country, this rarely happens and all these ""family murders and suicides in Forbes Tops"" are almost never real murders for personal reasons.

2) If we were a more Asian country like Japan, where there was a practice of suicide as a way to atone for guilt, perhaps he could only kill himself. But here suicide is very frowned upon, orthodox Christianity does not accept suicide. So...I doubt, mentally, that a strong, rich, powerful person would do such an act even if he were seriously depressed. To kill just yourself, yes. The whole family murdering is unlikely.

P.S. My great-grandfather was a famous athlete in Europe.

Not just the trajectory. It also changes the amount of charge / propellant per shot.

The first shot is aimed very high with the most propellant: leading to the most ""hang time"" since its aimed so high. The last shot is low with the least propellant, so the shell is literally moving slower... but aiming lower means that it has much less distance to travel to reach the target.

It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English-language edition (c. 1706–1721), which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights' Entertainment. The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central and South Asia, and North Africa.

Leopard 2 tanks are hardly ever produced from scratch, but only upgraded. To produce a Boxer or Puma takes time and the maintenance can only be done by absolute specialists.

No matter how you look at it, we have now reached a point where we have to distinguish between immediate aid and the organization of sustainable, victorious follow-up solutions.
It is precisely the latter that must now be addressed. We have to agree with the UKR on what they want and what is basically producible (not immediately deliverable), and then the assembly lines in the west have to be started up in three shifts.

In that case, the best solution is to procure used M1s from the USA: cheap, available, another user state in Poland, definitely better than anything the Ukrainian and Russian forces have now. Almost 400 M1s from the USMC are currently being decommissioned.

Which country in its right mind will order a Leo2 in the future if it can't be sure that the manufacturer (aka the country of origin) is not willing to keep the expensive tank running?
It could be that the SPD is in power in the country of origin, or that the potential opponent is the biggest energy supplier of the tank country of origin, or that the country of origin is of the opinion that the tank cannot be operated anyway...

Maybe if there is a certain obligation between buyer and seller via Art 5 NATO contract, but otherwise I would always buy the M1.

We don't produce enough Leopard 2s here and the M1A2 SEPv3 is in no way inferior to the Leopard 2, the Abrams never was (same origin, similar cycles etc.). With 400 Abrams from the USMC or even from other stocks, one would get an army equipped that is unparalleled in Eastern Europe.
In the long run, Ukraine cannot feel the advantage of having a mix in its equipment pool like the Poles: T-72 Twardy, Leopard 2A4, 2A5, 2PL and Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 (which replaces the Twardys). The T-64 is completely without future and after the war they should be largely used up. T-72A and sub variants as well as T-80 are also all obsolete. At most, it makes sense to think of reuses: pioneer tanks of all kinds or chassis for SPAAG and SPG. With something like that, you can keep your own industry in the game, but that's about it.

What really annoys me about this whole discussion is the government, which simply doesn't have the guts to communicate this.

Another Topic: It was about national and alliance defense why it was argued that Germany can't deliver anymore. If Germany reports tomorrow that it cannot operate VJTF and withdraws troops from the Baltics soon because spare parts are missing - especially in the V-case with its ""additional consumption"" - or training equipment is in short supply, I don't want to know how the Poles and Balts will think about this.",1650540856.0,1650540374.0,t3_u8eqnj,t1_i5lpwtx,,5,-4,0,-4,0,0,

The firing of the Howitzer is the easiest part of the job.

The harder part is emplacement / displacement. Unhitching the thing from the truck, preparing the land (digging a flat area so that the Howitzer sits up straight), placing the steel plates down to stabilize the Howitzer, etc. etc.

You want to emplace / displace as quickly as possible. That's how you stay alive on the battlefield. If enemy artillery start firing upon your position, or if enemy troops start to charge into your area, you will live/die entirely on how quickly you hook up that M777 howitzer back onto the truck.

------

There's nothing ""difficult"" about these jobs conceptually. But its something that training can grossly speed up. Doing it in 10 minutes is fine, but doing it in 2 minutes is safer, more effective, and increases survivability of the crew. You want these soldiers to practice as a team to do the job and speed things up as much as possible.

There's also a degree of manual labor / muscle building involved. Those shells are 50lbs after all. Practicing until your muscles grow into your job is also beneficial (but that muscle-building can happen in the field in this case. The goal is to get the bootcamp conscripts to a ""competent"" state, fast enough so that they won't die but it'd be wasteful to keep them training to reach elite/crack speeds of 2-minute emplace/displacement times and 10-rounds per minute firing speeds)",1650571076.0,1650570787.0,t3_u8eqnj,t1_i5npxgn,,6,3,0,3,0,0,

American merchant mariners were targeted with ferocious attacks by German submarines and naval ships attempting to stop the flow of goods into the UK for more than a year before the US officially entered WW2.  The US Merchantmarine was being shot at longer and had even higher casualties than any of the American military branches; the US Marine Corps was just behind them.

Cutting off shipping to and from your adversary is completely normal during a war.  There is effectively no distinction between civilian and military transports in wartime, which is something that all merchant mariners know.  This has been the case for at least a thousand years, it's not a new concept.

In this case, similar to the pirates off of Somalia, legal privateers would likely use speedboats full of armed men to board targeted merchant vessels, preferably at night, and any resistance would likely be extremely short-lived and not particularly bloody as the threat of extreme violence would be enough to make low-paid seamen give up the ship.  At that point, the privateers seize control of the merchant vessel, take the crew hostage, and navigate back to a friendly port.

It makes little sense to attach much diversity of Ukraine. The vehicles of the British and the Netherlands are ""only"" armored vehicles, the equivalent would be the DINGO 2 or the ""Fox"". The M113 exists almost only as mortars in the German Army. The Bushmasters of the Australians are a whole 20 pieces - but better than nothing. The majority is simply old Soviet material or is taken over from allies, because they don't have them themselves, because they either use different calibers or have switched to something else in the meantime.

Fuchs is now a barely supplyable multivariant clusterfuck,
Marder is cannibalized within the force to ensure eFP and VJTF; they have stopped planned retirements to still be able to generate the necessary spares.
Boxers were never enough,
Leopard 2, the Bw is just in the middle of the retrofit/upgrade dip... the whole Bw had just under 300 on the books over the last 10 years, about 170 in the available inventory, of which 100 were operational, of which 50+ were at eFP/VJTF and the remaining 50 or so for training/exercise at the school and in 6 PzBtl to put numbers to the whole drama,
Puma ... no comment... with luck in strength 2 Btl operationally available, almost everything booked for NATO. Thats the difference between a 700 billion Budget to a 50 Billion Budget.

Heavy equipment would escalate conflict

- Eastern Europeans supply T-72s and S-300s

-> That was after the U.S. and all other NATO partners had made it clear once again that they stand by each other, they had diligently calculated what combat troops were left on NATO's eastern flank, and Finland and Sweden were thinking aloud about whether they would join. At the beginning, the U.S. also said that it would not supply heavy weapons.

BW cannot deliver anything
- German armament industry: So we would have here about 50 Gepards, 100 Marder and some Leo 1 for general overhaul or stored.

-> Right, Ukraine can buy from the industry now. But Gepard, Marder and main battle tanks the Bw has no longer too much. 

Yes, but the logistics! They can't maintain the NATO stuff!
- UK deliver 120 armored vehicles alert type, M113 from USA and derivatives from BeNeLux

-> For M113 there are spare parts like sand at the sea, for Marder not. What the British deliver is modern and above all light stuff with spare parts from the industry or from the truck market.

One could consider whether the Fuchs tanks for Algeria could somehow be used for Ukraine.
