Two US officials anonymously confirmed to Politico on August 1 that no traces of US-provided High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Ukraine’s most precise artillery system, were found at the prison site.[4] The Kremlin alleges that Ukraine fired HIMARS and precision-guided rockets to kill Ukrainian POWs and deter Ukrainian defectors. Satellite and other imagery from the site indicate that the attack only damaged one building, did not collapse the walls of that building, and did not leave any shell craters in the vicinity, very strongly suggesting that the destruction of the prison was the result of either a precision strike or an internally planted incendiary or explosive.[5] One US official told Politico that “the evidence showed the attack was not conducted by Kyiv.” If Ukraine had used something other than HIMARS to conduct the strike, the attack would almost certainly have left collateral damage around the facility, including craters and other damaged buildings. Given the US assessment that HIMARS were not used in the attack, ISW assesses that Russia was responsible for this attack on Ukrainian POWs in violation of the Geneva Conventions.

Day 160 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was actually very quiet, there was no shelling, and the missile strike was not aimed at Kharkiv. With that missile strike they targeted Chuhuiv again, and destroyed a factory and some garages. They also destroyed a residential building. Thankfully there were no casualties.

There was no new missile strike yet, and it’s already almost 4am, the one yesterday happened at 3:45am, they started changing up their missile launch times more than usual. Honestly when it’s quiet it feels like there’s no war at all, as there are kids playing outside, and you see a lot of people everywhere you go. Yesterday our trams started running for the first time since the war started, at first we were weirded out by the sound, we thought there was a jet flying above us, but it turned out to be just a tram.

Also what is Russia thinking by letting Medvedev say the shit he says, why would he say that stuff about Georgia and Kazakhstan not being countries and that they need to be annexed by Russia? It’s one thing saying that about Georgia, they are not exactly on the friendliest terms after Russia attacked them before and tried to annex their territories, but why the hell would he try to piss off Kazakhstan? 

They are supposed to be allies, they are even in the same defensive organization, but Medvedev is saying that they are not a country and that they need to be annexed. Is that them being angry about Kazakhstan not supporting their invasion and not recognizing DPR and LPR? Russians did say that Medvedev was hacked, but I don’t believe that, as that text is exactly what he would say without being hacked. But still, him trying to make enemies out of Russian “allies” is too dumb even for Russians.",False,1659487563.0,t3_we1ofz,t3_we1ofz,,0,137,0,137,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

🪖 The battle lines didn’t move much on Monday and it was a slow news day, but [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1554260433380442116), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554150683816886272.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554260299737350150.html) go over all the details.  Today's special guest star is [Oleg Zhdanov](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554152647124475904.html) who brings a Ukrainian perspective to the assessments.

🚧  Apparently russia has moved [30 battalion tactical groups](https://twitter.com/UKikaski/status/1554194801221844998) into the Kherson area and may be gearing up not to defend Kherson, but to mount a counter-offensive.  This is [fine by Ukraine](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554209003999199238.html).  As russia moves stuff in, people are sensibly trying to [leave](https://twitter.com/NLwartracker/status/1554188121767649281).  While we all wait to find out what happens next, there’s more information coming out about that [train hit](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554025026822803456.html) over the weekend.  And finally, since the counter-offensive began (not specified), Ukraine has [liberated 46 villages](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554080884046823424) in the Kherson Oblast.  

👉 In regards to the executions of the Azov battalion prisoners of war: The US on Monday said its investigations show that [Ukraine did not fire](https://twitter.com/laraseligman/status/1554144486149816322) a HIMARS rocket at the prison camp.  russia claimed “[irrefutable evidence](https://twitter.com/mschwirtz/status/1553639763755892737) of Ukraine’s responsibility” however, the evidence is [fairly conclusive](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553346547739410432.html) that this was a deliberate, pre-meditated war-crime committed by russia. The Red Cross has not posted an update since it stated it had [been denied access](https://twitter.com/ICRC_ua/status/1553402454473117697) to the prison.

👉 As of Monday, the Ukrainian Postal Service has [stopped serving](https://twitter.com/HarZizn/status/1554143569081933825) territories occupied by the russians.  This will be very hard on pensioners who [depend on the post office](https://twitter.com/maria_avdv/status/1547196375200407552) for their checks.  Reasons cited were the threat to postal worker’s lives and risk of robbery by russian forces.

👉 According to official russian combat statistics, for every single moscow resident killed in the war, 712 ethnic minorities [are killed](https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1554157473422000130).

💰 Europeans pay Gazprombank for oil and gas, Gazprombank [pays russian soldiers](https://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt/status/1554026796668043267) in Ukraine.

💰 Ukraine earns [$20 million](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554150530255126530) in the first month of exporting electricity to western Europe.  It helps that Europe’s caseload electricity contracts are [at record highs](https://twitter.com/JavierBlas/status/1554154382522028032).

💰 A little known Belgium company is single handedly propping up what’s left of russia’s banking system and could [paralyze russia](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1554159102925873152) if it left.

💰 France freezes [€1.2 billion euros](https://twitter.com/uawarinfo/status/1554177580789538818) worth of russian assets.

🇺🇸🎁  The US announced a [$550 million dollar aid package](https://twitter.com/SecDef/status/1554197040904785921) for Ukraine consisting of 75,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition and the rest for HIMARS rockets.   75,000 is roughly a [month’s supply](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554177134058504193.html) of artillery shells.  Additionally, the 4 HIMARS promised last week have [arrived in Ukraine](https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1554076054435889152).

🇩🇪🎁 The MARS II MLRS systems announced by Germany last week [have arrived](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554073029122072576) in Ukraine.

🔥🇩🇪 Despite russia’s games with the Nord Stream pipeline, Germany is still [making good progress](https://twitter.com/jakluge/status/1554098200713248770) filling up its gas stores for winter.  In perhaps unsurprising news given the [costs of gas](https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1553478435112161281) and electricity in Germany right now, [70% of Germans](https://twitter.com/thorstenbenner/status/1553642681695440898) favor extending the life of their nuclear power plants.

🌾 The [first ship](https://twitter.com/maria_avdv/status/1554001516519989248) with Ukrainian grain [left Odesa](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1553994821295304704.html) on Monday.  It’s being monitored by the [coordination center](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554139528025309185) in Turkey, set up to ensure the safe passage of grain shipments.   Even if all the parties cooperate, the grain shipments are still dangerous as [sea mines continue to be found](https://twitter.com/CNBCPolitics/status/1554119689571389440), even in neutral waters.

🌾 The Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce said that last week’s report that Egypt had canceled their grain contract with Ukraine was [fake news](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554011553208434688.html).

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 2 August 2022
 
- The Sierra Leone-flagged cargo ship RAZONI left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa on 1 August, headed to the port of Tripoli in Lebanon loaded with 26,000 tonnes of Ukrainian grain. This marks the first grain shipment from a Ukrainian port since the invasion began, enabled by an agreement on a grain export transit corridor between Ukraine, Turkey, the UN, and Russia on 22 July.

- The reported strike on Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol on Navy Day is the latest setback for the Black Sea Fleet in the five-month-old war against Ukraine, which included the loss of its flagship, the cruiser MOSKVA, in April 2022.

- Following the reports of cancelled parades, it is unlikely that the Black Sea Fleet can manage high profile public events alongside its wartime activities.

> Russia’s strategic positioning as a commodities exporter has irrevocably deteriorated, as it now deals from a position of weakness with the loss of its erstwhile main markets, and faces steep challenges executing a “pivot to Asia” with non-fungible exports such as piped gas.

> Russian gas exports to Europe (and the revenue that is derived) have plummeted to near-record lows.

> Despite some lingering leakiness, Russian imports have largely collapsed, and the country faces stark challenges securing crucial inputs, parts, and technology from hesitant trade partners, leading to widespread supply shortages within its domestic economy.

> By far and large, the flow of imports into Russia has drastically slowed in the months since the invasion. A review of trade data from Russia’s top trade partners –since, again, the Kremlin is no longer releasing its own import data –suggests that Russian imports fell by upwards of ~50% in the initial months following the invasion. 

> Despite Putin’s delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent; the hollowing out of Russia’s domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst.

> As a result of the business retreat, Russia has lost companies representing ~40% of its GDP, reversing nearly all of three decades’ worth of foreign investment and buttressing unprecedented simultaneous capital and population flight in a mass exodus of Russia’s economic base.

> Putin is resorting to patently unsustainable, dramatic fiscal and monetary intervention to smooth over these structural economic weaknesses, which has already sent his government budget into deficit for the first time in years and drained his foreign reserves even with high energy prices – and Kremlin finances are in much, much more dire straits than conventionally understood.

> Russian domestic financial markets, as an indicator of both present conditions and future outlook, are the worst performing markets in the entire world this year despite strict capital controls, and have priced in sustained, persistent weakness within the economy with liquidity and credit contracting – in addition to Russia being substantively cut off from international financial markets, limiting its ability to tap into pools of capital needed for the revitalization of its crippled economy.

> Rapid inflation has eaten away the purchasing power of Russians and cut consumption. Industrial production has been supported by the military industry, while other production has developed more poorly, the Bank of Finland institute for Emerging Economies (BOFIT) said in its weekly update.

> According to the Russian Ministry of Economy's preliminary estimate, the country's GDP shrank by 4% in May from a year earlier. In the June survey by Consensus Economics, the average of Russia's GDP forecasts was -8% for this year and -2% for next year.

> Consumption demand has decreased as uncertainty increases and purchasing power weakens. The amount of retail trade in May was 10% lower than a year earlier. Consumer prices rose in Russia in April-May by 17–18% y/y. In April, the average real (ie corrected for price increase) monthly salary of Russians was 7% lower than a year earlier.

It seems to be: If we don't ask our allies to circumvent their own Russia sanctions, we are giving Putin an excuse to stop gas deliveries. By asking our allies to circumvent their own Russia sanctions, we are calling ""Putin's bluff.""
>
>If Moscow wants an excuse to stop delivering gas, they'll make up an excuse to stop delivering gas. You could ask a thousand allies for a thousand sanctioned pipelines and that wouldn't change.
>
>The Chancellery obviously knows this. So what is this supposed to change? The idea seems to be that voters will be more forgiving if they think Berlin isn't to blame for a halt in gas deliveries. Within that logic, Berlin avoids blame by meeting Moscow's demands.
>
>But is that really the best way to maximise voter support? I doubt it. People are going to be unhappy either way and if they'd like to blame the government, they'll just say Putin had to do this because Germany delivered weapons to Ukraine or whatever.
>
>At the very least, it seems absurd to me that Scholz now wants to be praised for calling ""Putin's bluff"" given that he did exactly what Putin wanted. Putin can still cut gas anytime he wants but he also used Germany to pressure an ally [Canada] into circumventing sanctions.
>
>Here's an alternative: ""Germany will not be blackmailed. We will not weaken sanctions. Russia has no justification to stop delivering gas but if they do, we stand ready. This winter will be difficult but we will get through it together.""

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.

I read your daily updates every chance that I can.  Like /u/Unimpressionable_, I am sure you are much more knowledgable about these things than I am (a random American with only a passing knowledge of Eastern European History).  My perspective is that Putin seems to see all of the former Soviet members as illegitimate countries that are, in his view, lost territories of Russia.  IE the Soviet Union was not in fact a union so much as it was Russia and its surrounding vassal states.  Perhaps there is more nuance to it than that, but it seems to me that even allies such as Belarus are only allowed to be ""independent"" so long as they are acting under Russia's banner.  I do not think this is a logical perspective so much as it is one born of pride, avarice, and jealousy.  Perhaps that explains some of the hostility being shown toward Georgia and Kazakhstan?

Russia doesn't just want to control Ukraine, it wants to wipe the concept of Ukraine off the map.  It wants to subjugate its people and have them live in poverty and fear while stealing their resources.

Anyone that stood up for themselves under Russian rule would be murdered or taken away and tortured.  People would disappear just for owning something that some Russian wanted.  Others for saying something that is overheard by a person working for the regime.

Imagine living a life where it feels like an invisible set of hands are on your shoulders constantly pushing down on you and you feel like you have to take a deep breath and hold it in whenever you went outside.  Where you're afraid of people coming to get you in the middle of the night for something you might have said.

Does anyone really think someone like Zelenskyy could have cut and run and sold out his country and future generations to that fate?  That someone with as much compassion and love for his country as him could abandon it like that?  He would never have been able to live with himself after doing it.

Trump, the psychopathic greedy pig and Russian stooge, trying to lecture Zelenskyy on what to do.

Edit, okay, I guess you could have unequal hours light around the earth if a sun orbited it at a point that is unequal to the earth's center, or perhaps if the sun's orbit was an ellipsis? Anyway, this take is still exotically wrong. :-D",1659437116.0,1659436612.0,t3_we1ofz,t1_iimj5co,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

The mistake in his reasoning is that he doesn't realize that the full scale invasion of Ukraine much like Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 was the sign to the world that diplomacy was over and that there was no point in bargaining anymore. Yes I get it's not a perfect analogy, the Russians invaded Poland as well and then things sort of oddly paused over the winter in mainland Europe while the Soviets invaded Finland but more in terms of a turning point in how the world viewed Germany occurred. Appeasement was over, trying to deal with Hitler as a rational actor was over, there wasn't going to be any more carrot, from then on it would be all stick.

The world let Russia get away with the 2008 invasion of Georgia like they let Hitler get away with remilitarization of the Rhineland, then we let Russia get away with the 2014 invasion of Ukraine much like we sold out Czechoslovakia. But after Poland the world finally woke up to the fact Hitler would not stop, just like we have finally woken up to the fact Putin will not stop.

I think that the west has finally realized attempts at friendly diplomacy and trade with Russia were mistakes and were mistakes not to be repeated.

But towards the bottom it says that emigration slowed down in 2022, and below is a graph. Of course it is off an ever decreasing base and using simple math one could figure out the actual rate. Ie. percentage and absolute number are not as useful as emigration per capita but I cannot find this number.

Perhaps a more useful measure in the graph below is the lower one showing % change YoY. So far the change in 2022 seems to be insignificant.

That doesn't make them targets, nor does it result in a dead male automatically being counted as a combatant kill. An excerpt: 

>Military-age males refers to all boys and men over the age of 16, irrespective of whether or not they are actually participating in hostilities. It is important to note that this does not automatically equate all boys and men with combatants. However, it demarcates boys and men for different treatment in conflict.

But just for you, let's discuss the differences.

1. The Holocaust was directly and intentionally ordered by Hitler. It was done by the German Armed forces. The killing of South Koreans suspected of communist links was done by the South Koreans. Are there some instances of the US Army approving executions? Yes. Should the US have done more to stop the executions? Yes. Did the US Army directly execute 100,000 South Korean civilians? No.
2. The Nazi leadership recognized racial purity as a long term goal. Killing groups they considered lesser races was central to their ideology. The goal of the Nazis in Poland was not to improve the lives of the Poles - they wanted to kill all the Poles and give their land to Germans. The US has never had any goal of genocide towards South Koreans. 
3. Hitler started the war in Poland. The US did not start the Korean War.
4. North/South Korea and East/West Germany are two extremely unique examples in history where we can look at countries with similar starting points and see what different economic and political systems do. In both cases, the liberal democracy won, and it wasn't close.

The gist here is that the Korean War lead to large numbers of innocent people getting wrongly executed. The US should have done a better job of protesting and stopping those executions. At the same time, the largely positive outcome of South Korea does give credence to the idea that US intervention in the Korean War was largely a positive for the South Koreans who would otherwise live under what can only really be described as a fascist monarchy.",False,1659476625.0,t3_we1ofz,t1_iioruq5,,7,4,0,4,0,0,
