The Russian budget had a deficit of forty-seven billion dollars in 2022, one of the highest since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although the Russian government conveniently decided not to publish data on the government spending this year, it is safe to assume that military spending contributed to the bulk of the increase in spending.  
>  
>Going into 2023, Russia’s budget deficit may be higher than Russia claims. Moscow anticipates its budget deficit in 2023 to be 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), based on the assumption that Russia’s flagship crude blend Urals is traded at seventy dollars a barrel. However, if the oil price cap lowers the Russian oil price to the maximum of sixty dollars while spending remains the same, the deficit would be closer to 4.5 percent, according to Financial Times estimates.  
>  
>To keep filling in the budget deficit and financing the war in Ukraine, Moscow will have to redirect funds from other domestic programs. In 2022, additional budget revenue came from Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the one-time taxing of Gazprom, and issuance of largest-ever Federal Loan Obligations. However, in 2023, as the European Union (EU) works hard to diversify away from Russian gas, Gazprom is likely to have less revenue, therefore less tax revenue. Meanwhile, diverting sovereign wealth fund money toward the war takes away Russia’s rainy day fund and might result in slashing funding for schools and hospitals next year.

1. We don't know what that military facility is exactly (is it  a factory, depot, command center, barracks, etc...)
2. We don't know who's behind the attack, despite nebulous claims by Russian and Iranian state media it's ""from a NATO or NATO-Linked Country"". Please remember Russia/Iran don't have free media like western countries and that their state media is pure propaganda. Yes, it's at the direction of the state. But anyone that follows Julia Davis knows Russian state media =/= state policy. If it was, the world would of been nuked a hundred times over.  Current speculation is it could be Israel, Azerbaijan, or even from the ongoing domestic protests/revolution.
3. We don't know the motivations of said attack, given we don't know #2.

Learning from the Polish Downed Missile Crisis and all the worry around ""will NATO invoke article 4 or article 5?!"" (spoiler: it was neither), let's hold off assuming ""because a drone was involved, and an Iranian military facility was involved, and Iran's military supplies drones to Russia in its conflict with Ukraine, it's 100% due to that, and thus 100% relevant.""

It *might* be the case that's exactly it. But if it's not, then it's not relevant to the Live Thread.

No doubt the truth will have nuance. Which requires facts. Which we collective lack.

**The only confirmed facts we have as of this comment is there was a drone attack against a military facility in Isfahan.**

Without fail these WILL pop up in a discussion because the nature of what they believe is forged on these fallacies.

But 2 decades of failed nation-building and mission-creep and false pretenses surrounding Iraq? No thanks. In fact those events were a key reason why my family switched from Republican to Democrat and never looked back.

These days, those wars are deeply unpopular in the US and anyone who adamantly supported them tend to stay *very quiet* these days from embarrassment or pretended they didn't buy the propaganda of the Bush administration in the first place. My point is that many of us aren't being hypocrites. We hate America for what we did to Iraq and we hate Russia for what it's doing to Ukraine. Period.

He's afraid that he will be toppled should democracy come anywhere near the Kremlin. He sees it as a tool used by America and the CIA for toppling dictators. His ultra paranoid KGB mind sees American and CIA conspiracies behind even the slightest thing which goes wrong for him.  

He's deadly afraid of being toppled like other dictators. He's obsessively watched tapes of the last moments in dictators lives, such as Gaddafi and Saddam. He sees his own fate when he watches those tapes. He actually ranted about it to people in the Kremlin.  

The Euromaidan uprising in Ukraine scared the hell out of Putin. He saw the public rising up. He thought democracy may be demanded by the Russian people. He had to stop that at all costs. That's why he has declared war on Ukraine. To keep democracy away so he can continue to live.  

The problem is that he cannot win the war as easily as he believed. There's a group who have really taken the Kremlin propaganda and gone to town with it. They're like the American QAnon types, ultra nationalistic and bloodthirsty. They brand anyone who so much as hints at withdrawing without a total victory as a coward, and unpatriotic traitor to Russia.   

Dictators tend to hide behind a tough man act. Just look at Hitler and Mussolini strutting around. Putin is no different. He has a carefully crafted image as a strong tough man of action, a bare chested man, desired by women with memes and songs about him.  

Any failure to annihilate Ukraine would be seen as Putin being a weak coward, a traitor to Russia and in league with Nazis. That's dangerous as it could damage his phony image and put his life in jeopardy.

This is comparable to the thinking behind the Battle of Verdun but not exactly the same. With Verdun, the German High Command thought that the French would defend the culturally significant area of Verdun so fanatically that the entire French Army would basically wither away all of France's manpower, and that the French would eventually sue for peace after enough of their men had died.

The fallacy of Verdun was that Germany took almost as many casualties as France did, completely mooting the point of their strategy. They did not realize that it would be as costly for them as it was for France, and the planner behind Verdun, General Falkenhayn, was soon sacked for incompetence. Russia, by contrast, knows ahead of time that their own losses in assaulting Bakhmut will be worse than Ukraine's losses in defending it, but they are doing it anyway because they have calculated that they have enough manpower to last through an extremely expensive attritional campaign.

Ironically, France did actually come fairly close to breaking as a result of Verdun, which is why France demanded that the British launch an offensive to the north. The purpose of this offensive was fix German reinforcements in place and take pressure off Verdun, at the cost of enormous British casualties. In essence, the French wanted Britain to do their own version of Verdun to the Germans.

The British eventually obliged, in a tiny little battle you may have heard of, called the Somme. The shallow textbook version of the Somme is that it was a British failure. The actual truth of the Somme is that it more or less succeeded in its real aims: to stop the Germans from continuing the attack on Verdun, split German forces between two costly sub-fronts, and caused a number of casualties that ultimately proved more unsustainable for Germany than the members of the Entente.

Ultimately, the success or failure of the Russian assault on Bakhmut comes down to two objectives: (1) preventing a Ukrainian counter-offensive until it is too late, when Russia has built up an overwhelming number of trained conscript forces to hold what they have; and (2) avoiding unacceptably high casualties. It's too early to know if either of those objectives are falling within acceptable margins for Russia's strategists.",1674924672.0,1674924293.0,t3_10n5ktz,t1_j68xs04,,1,39,0,39,0,0,

Many of you are not, many are. 

As for the false equivalence: The *ongoing* US-American behavior towards war-crimes commited by US troops simply makes it hard to be in the camp of *""the west would never behave that way""* and when it comes to war it devolves into for us/against us argument which tends to ignore the own war crimes and overemphasizes war crimes of others.

As a European iÍ see little moral highground for the USA when it comes to invading other countries, black sites and bombing of civilian infrastructure. But the USA is our ally and the rule of law is at least broadly followed in the US military and russia is simply commiting untold atrocities in Ukraine (and in Africa and in the middle east and in Russia itself).

My dad told me a funny story about that. Many years ago in an exercise in West Germany a tank was disabled by a tin of powdered potato hitting just the right spot between the turret and the hull which jammed the turret in place. It was deep in a forest and not being able to turn the turret it needed a tank recovery crew to take it back to base.  

They were all meant to be firing blanks but the other team cheated and was ignoring the umpires when they marked them as dead. The tins where the same diameter as the barrel so they used the blanks to fire the tins at the cheating team. Power is rather explosive when compressed.  

Also during that exercise, a crazy guy on the cheating team tried throwing a thunderflash in the commanders hatch on one tank. Luckily the commander managed to deflect it away. The commander ordered his tank after that guy, flattening any trees that got in their way until they pinned him to a tree with the tanks tow hook and held him there like that.  

The RSM got tired of the cheating and the umpires inability of controlling the situation, so he call his men into formation and to attach bayonets. Then, on his horse, he drew his sword and charged at the other team. The other team ran off.

I have a very strong suspicion a lot of those European F-16's are going to get given to Ukraine both as planes and to be used as spare parts.   

I also suspect a number of Eurofighter Typhoons will be sent too as the older models are getting replaced. The reason why I suspect the Typhoon is because Europe will want to send European weapons that the F-16 isn't certified for and there simply aren't enough Rafale or Gripens out there.  

A Typhoon is far better for air to air with Meteor than an F-16.

- Guide the feed tray cover to the latched position. Never let the cover slam down. If you slam the cover down, the cover lock is damaged. Then you can’t lock the cover in place. If that’s not enough, slamming also knocks the primary drive lever out of alignment with the secondary drive lever. That causes feeding problems.
- Push the secondary drive lever all the way to the right and then guide the cover down, making sure the two levers mate. If they won’t mate, you probably have a problem with the feed slide guide rod spring. Your small arms repairman should check it out. 
- Align the feed tray cover pin prong before pushing the pin in place. If you jam in the pin without aligning the prong, the prong could be snapped off. Then the pin can work out during firing and the cover comes loose.
- Put the rear sight bar down and push in the elevation screw knob before you push down the sight. If you forget either step, you’ll soon be without a sight. Protect the sight by locking it down when you’re not firing.
- Charge overhanded. Charge with your hands on top of the charging handles and your palms down. Use a steady and smooth pull for a good charge.

What needs to happen to fully recover and build back after this conflict? 

>What happens to a childs education in a time of war? We learn about Irwin’s efforts to keep Ukrainian kids in school and to continue to think about their future development. What is technology’s role in all this? We explore the playbook for addressing future conflicts and disasters and the importance of asking a kid what they want to be when they grow up.

Utter nonsense.  Ukraine using cluster munitions can help end the war faster (or could be the difference between losing territory to Russian human wave offensives and taking back Russian held territory), meaning there will be *less* threats to civilians in the future.

Ukraine is defending Bakhmut because they don't have a better choice. If they give up Bakhmut, Russia will use the human-wave tactics on the next line, and the next after that, and the next after that, for as far as Ukraine is willing to pull back. They are defending Bakhmut because it is a large urban area that makes defending against the human waves easier, but ""easier"" does not mean ""easy.""

People are dying just sitting in trenches, and they are starting to get pissed. Ukraine does not have unlimited artillery shells and men to send into this quagmire. At a certain point they are going to have to start sending in more and more of their elite units to hold this area, and that's bad because it means those elite units can't go into an armored offensive in the spring.

I have little doubt this is why the West is reacting so quickly now to the need for tanks.

The F-16 started off life as a cheap alternative ""interceptor"" to the F-15.  Only after some tinkering in the 1980s did multi-fighter capabilities get bolted on as variants.

The F-16 is easier to maintain, easier to fly, has greater range, and is cheaper than the Eurofighter.  The Eurofighter is faster, has better thrust to weight ratio and can carry more weapons than an F-16.  The F-16 does have a lower cost per flight hour and is a lot cheaper.

For 25 years the F-16 was the gold standard for air-to-air maneuverability, only dethroned by the Eurofighter when it went into production in the early 2000s.

Having said that, Ukraine will get what NATO countries have to spare.  The USAF is phasing out F-16s in favor of F-35s (the F-15s that the F-22 replaced were already handed over to the state's Air National Guards).  The Other NATO nations are not phasing out Eurofighters in favor of F-35s, but will use any F-35s they buy in a supplementary rolls to the Typhoon, like Spain uses the F/A-18.  But all of this is dependent on how well and quickly the European NATO member can bring their 6th Gen. fighters ([FCAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Combat_Air_System) for France/German/Spain and [Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Tempest) for UK/Italy) into production.  If they face the same delays as the Eurofighter did, and those countries look to ""rearm"" now rather than later, they are going to buy more of what they have in production already.

Sorry this took so long, but what it means is that Ukraine will probably get F-16s.  The US is phasing out operational ones right now, while there is a panic in Germany, Italy, France and Spain over defense spending because of the invasion, and the UK's domestic economic issues brought on by Brexit has their government pinching pennies.",False,1674932109.0,t3_10n5ktz,t1_j698s9h,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

They *were* getting ground down. This was before Ukraine had a chance to capitalize on Western long-range artillery and missiles. If HIMARS had not arrived by mid Summer, Ukraine would have continued to take unsustainable losses, and they very well could have been looking at a collapsing front line.

The problem now is that Russia has adjusted to Ukraine's artillery tactics. Their adjusted strategy is to literally throw so many bodies into the front that Ukraine has to expose and use up its artillery killing those untrained human waves while Russian elite forces slip through the gaps and attack the Ukrainian trenches.

Russia's tactics *are* effective here, at least for a short-term timetable. Obviously they are horrifically costly and are a bad idea if you are a leader who cares about Russia's future, but Russia's current leaders do not care about that issue. Russia's leaders are gambling that this extremely expensive crime against humanity will break Ukraine in the next 6-12 months. If this gamble fails, then Russia is going to be way worse off. If it works, then Russia might just get its off-ramp.

>What's more likely is that Ukraine has a lot of well-trained soldiers by virtue of being at war for the past year, unit rotations, and training programs abroad. 

You should read some of the interviews embedded journalists have been doing with Bakhmut units. That is *not* the conclusion those units are expressing. They are saying the opposite -- that units have taken so many losses that much of their experienced manpower pool is sapped up, and the replacement leaders are resorting to increasingly ill conceived frontal counter-attacks that waste more lives than their previous commanders did.

Undoubtedly, Russian propaganda efforts want to capitalize on this picture, but it's false to say that this narrative is only coming from Russia. It's also coming from the Ukrainian units themselves.

It's almost certainly true that Ukraine is holding back most of its best forces. But there's an open question *how many* of its best forces are being held back, and for how long they will be held back, and for how long they can be held back.

And that is exactly what they're good for: the short term. Apparently sending waves of men to their deaths is only effective for prisoners (just look at how the regular Russian forces have been getting annihilated in Zaporizhzhia trying to use the same tactics), and if sources are to be believed, Wagner has chewed through 40,000 prisoners, and is having difficulty recruiting more.

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.
