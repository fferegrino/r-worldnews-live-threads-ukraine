64% of the 34 million tonnes of grain exported under the deal went to low- and middle-income countries. Unsurprisingly then, Kenya called Russia’s withdrawal a “stab in the back” of countries in the Horn of Africa already impacted by drought.  
  
Russian missile attacks on Odessa, Chornomorsk and Mykolaiv destroyed over 60,000 tons of grain. That is enough to feed 270,000 people for a year or to double WFP \[World Food Programme\] shipments under the BSGI to both Sudan and Somalia. Russia has destroyed dock equipment, making it harder to load grain on ships.  
  
Now, Russia has gone further, burning food at the dockside, and making threats to murder civilian sailors.  
  
There is no possible justification for these punitive acts.  
  
Moreover, Russia has benefitted from the Deal. Russian food exports are significantly above pre-war levels. Russian food and fertiliser exports have never been sanctioned. The UK has worked with its banking and insurance sectors to facilitate transactions. And the UN has worked tirelessly to address Russian concerns.  
  
We know that Russia’s so-called reasons for ending the Deal are nonsense.  
  
Ukraine has made no demands. As Foreign Minister Kuleba said in this room, Ukraine wants nothing more than to make its food available to the world. Up to 24 million tons of Ukrainian food may not now reach world markets because of Russia.  
  
Russia’s actions have already raised prices, with immediate impact on the world’s poorest and hungriest people.  
  
And Russia’s latest demands are tantamount to holding the world’s starving hostage.  
  
We thank Türkiye, the UN and Ukraine for their efforts to protect the deal. We call on Russia to rejoin it and to end the war.  
  
Food is not a weapon.

Warsaw’s increasingly hostile attitude requires more attention to ensure the security of Russia and Belarus, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after Poland decided to deploy its military troops on the Eastern border on Tuesday.

The presence of Wagner Group mercenaries in Belarus prompted the Polish Defence Ministry to redeploy some military troops to reinforce the country’s eastern border, Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak announced.

Very interesting insight from two well known military analysts. 

Something bad: Ukraine came out in speed and force at the beginning of June and that was indeed the big counter offensive that put it's brakes on quick to preserve combat power due to various short fallings. Lack of inter-unit cooperation, lack of probing and battlefield surveillance, disorientation at night operations leading to advanced through mined areas instead of demined paths, lack of coordination and launching attacks hours after they should have happened, amongst other issues 

Something good: It appears Ukraine didn't commit a large amount of is combat power to the start of the offensive due to the inability to scale it beyond a few companies here and there. Instead of scaling at the battalion or brigade level. Hopefully as the troops get more combat and soldiering experience, they'll be able to scale the offensive in the future provided the brigades don't suffer major attrition.

Something interesting: Russia is using a lot more mines than is typical in Russian or Soviet doctrine, like a lot more. Everything is caked in Anti-Armor and Anti-Personnel mines to a high saturation. Because of this, Ukrainian demining systems are high value targets.

On March 13th, I wrote a detailed message, advocating for a more restrained outlook on the then-upcoming counter-offensive and proposing an alternative strategy. Other analysts also recommended emphasizing a long-term approach as well.


>As the war rages on, both sides gradually deplete their assault capabilities. Operating a large army, equipped for operational maneuvers, becomes increasingly challenging over time. Many observers tend to focus on equipment forgetting that there are humans operating it. In light of this situation, several potential paths lie ahead:

>A) The Frozen Conflict Scenario: Some find the idea of a frozen conflict attractive, as it appears to offer an illusion of a problem resolved through a simple signature on paper. However, such a view is overly simplistic and fraught with difficulties for several reasons:

>- Per the Constitution, neither the President nor the Parliament can cede territories of Ukraine. Territorial changes require an all-Ukrainian referendum, which is practically impossible to conduct, especially in occupied regions like Donbas and Crimea, under Ukrainian supervision. The population of Ukraine is extremely unlikely to vote in favor.

>- Past experiences with negotiated ceasefires and security guarantees have shown that they are unreliable. Ukraine has been deceived by Russia in the past, losing territory despite agreements like the Budapest Memorandum and Minsk Accords. The presence of United Nations blue helmets has proved ineffective in preventing conflicts, as evident in Mali, Congo and other countries.

>- The lack of tangible security guarantees or a clear path to NATO membership raises doubts about Russia's commitment to honoring any truce or peace deal. Without broader acceptance and assurance, such agreements are unlikely to be embraced by society.

>- Embracing this scenario would create a sprawling, thousands-kilometer frontline perpetuating a sluggish war. As we've seen in Syria since 2011, such conflicts can endure for years, fueling instability, poverty, and escalating immigration crises. Russia could continue to exploit this leverage to further destabilize Ukraine and pursue its political objectives.

>Now, let’s take a look at the second scenario: 

>B) Ukrainian Victory and Regime Collapse in Russia

>The objective of this scenario is to induce a regime collapse in Russia through a series of continuous military defeats. Recent events, such as the Wagner Group mutiny, suggest that the Putin regime might be more susceptible to collapse than previously assessed. 

>To achieve long-term goals, I think that the following strategies and approaches should be applied:

>- Rather than fixating on the notion of a single game-changing weapon, we all should focus on adapting production, economics, weaponry delivery, logistics, experience exchange and long-term security policies to ensure victory and a new post-war reality.

>- Multiple countries must increase ammunition production to meet the demands of the front. Instances like Bakhmut, where artillery shortages resulted in avoidable casualties, underscore the need to prioritize human lives over ammunition.

>- Extensive worldwide training programs are essential, extending beyond soldiers and sergeants. Emphasis should be placed on developing larger and improved combat medic, pilot, and senior officer training programs.

>- We should foster experience exchange programs to share valuable combat insights with our partners. Additionally, allies can contribute their expertise, particularly in the maintenance, operation, and logistics of Western equipment.

>- Our allies should assist with more Anti-Air assets, not only to challenge Russian air supremacy but also to safeguard civilian infrastructure. Investing in protection is more cost-effective than dealing with the aftermath of destruction.

>- Increase pressure on russian oligarchs and elites through tougher sanctions. Address the issue of certain individuals potentially circumventing sanctions by spending money in Europe and continuing business operations through shell companies.

>- We must procure additional engineering and mine-clearing equipment to bolster our capabilities. Additionally, we need more cooperation to efficiently demine liberated territories, ridding them of landmines and unexploded ordnance for the safety of people

>- Demanding changes from our allies must be accompanied by our own progress. Long-term commitment deals with partners should include conditions like adopting anti-corruption laws and aligning the legal system with EU standards for a smoother transition into the European system.

>- An essential step towards progress involves hiring  retired Western generals and experts to enhance and later rebuild the current command structure. Their valuable insights can aid in eliminating remnants of the Soviet system within our military approach.

>- To attain air parity, a mere few dozen jets won't suffice; a larger fleet and additional maintenance crew programs are imperative. Teaching pilots to operate machinery and cooperate effectively as a team is essential, but we must go beyond that. A comprehensive training program in NATO-standard combat arms is vital to ensure optimal utilization of these assets. This strategic approach will be instrumental in achieving the desired air parity objectives.

>Neither option proves appealing nor straightforward and easy. Although various alternatives and potential events may arise, discussing them becomes pointless as our efforts should center around operating within the realm of likelihood rather than entertaining black swan events.

>Starting this conversation within the community is vital to work towards the right outcome. I urge everyone to actively participate by liking and sharing, engaging a larger audience in the conversation. Your constructive suggestions and opinions are highly encouraged as we collectively strive for positive change.

government representatives from basic values.

I'm sure many of the calculations the Kremlin made as far as what world reaction was going to be was based around that rather arrogant assumption that Russian forces would run Ukraine's resistance mostly into the dirt within a week.  (And to be honest - I suspect that's the same assumption most of the West and the US made as far as planning to support Ukrainian resistance in a conflict.)  Putin probably thought that maintaining enough economic flexibility to outlast maybe a year or less in Western sanctions and a beating in the global  political sphere would be sufficient - then it would all die down and they'd be able to carry on being Russian.

But that didn't happen - not in the least.   So Putin started looking for 'decisive' solutions - first to win the war (the mobilization), then to try and push for a painful negotiation from a position of strength (where we are now, approximately).   But global persistence in resistance aiding a dogged Ukrainian resolve to outright win has been denying him at every turn.   And now that the economic instruments he had available are all but useless, and he could count the number of global allies on the hairs coming out of his right ear, he's in a desperate spot that he hasn't had a plan for.

He's completely winging it at this point - he's trying to play off of any former tools, position and status Russia had looking like a world power, even though the shell around him is more thin and hollow than the chocolate Easter bunnies you buy at the rundown dollar store down the street.

Small changes, little more in September, little more in October, than complete failure for  Russia.

This year so far is the same. One part is different, it is not only Kherson. It is Kherson left  bank, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, up to Bakhmut.

&#x200B;

* In Bakhmut Ukraine got control over the heights around Bakhmut rendering fire control over the city. Ukraine can now put real pressure on poor Russian soldiers in the occupied city. Putin will never let them retreat but fill up the losses with fresh ""meat"" to the Bakhmut cauldron.
* Vital pushes in the south starts to endanger Russian supply routs. Ukraine hits on daily bases so far south as Berdiansk. Russian land based supply lines is in danger.
* Kerch bridge is hit again. Russian officials recommends the land based route. See the  above bullet.
* Almost 700 Russian artillery pieces destroyed last month alone. Many trained artillery men dead. Numerous reports from Russian soldiers lacking artillery support. Bring 700 new artillery pieces back to front and train new men is not sustainable.
* Some 4000 soldiers liquidated the last month. With a slight uptick last days. How many wounded? How many surrendered?
* Hits on vital train hubs, the one north of Crimea was huge including the ammo depot. Hitting bridges, hitting ammo depots, hitting fuel depots. All more frequent than before.
* Hitting command posts. More high ranking officers liquidated now than in a long time.

Other factors:

* Coup attempt, making Putin & Kremlin revealing how week they are.
* Russia's Central Bank made statements on the weak Russian economy.
* New types of weapons, more weapons, more ammunition delivered to Ukraine.
* Sweden Closer to NATO, so is Ukraine.
* More sanctions, more sanctions towards those who help Russia evade sanctions.

Keep up the great work Ukraine! Imo it looks great, even better this year compared to last year!

The only time I remember Air Defense being pulled out of Turkey was 2013 when US had to do some maintenance on the Patriot systems in Germany. They sent F15s and had other allies send AD systems to cover the void.

It's not a Turkey issue it's an Erdogan issue. Turkey was on it's way to buy Patriot systems until Erdogan was elected PM and started to involve himself in negotiations. He threatened to buy a Chinese AD originally but backed off after NATO told him outright that it would never be integrated into NATO's systems. This all happened during the Obama years.

Then comes along Erdogan's fake little coup he pulled in 2017 in order to purge the military and other government offices of his opponents. He blamed the coup on one of his opponents that had been living in USA because it was an easy scapegoat. He got all butt hurt when USA wouldn't extradite him to support his narrative with the US citing an extreme lack of evidence. 

Cue in Putin. He's at the height of his game still. He got his chosen candidate elected in Washington. This is a prime opportunity for him to embarrass the US and NATO. Putin calls Erdogan up sweet talks him and offers to sell him an S400 system and meet all of Erdogan technology transfer demands. Turkey then agrees to purchase the S400 immediately breaking from tradition of taking their time to work out a deal. 

Now with Trump in office Erdogan assumes that their won't be an issue with Turkey buying the S400s. He was able to fool Trump into believing that Turkey had no other option than to buy the Russian system. There's speculation that Trump may have given reassurances that he did not have the power to give. Meanwhile NATO and the rest of the US government is telling Erdogan if they buy the S400 then they will not be able to purchase F-35s, they will be sanctioned due to doing business with Russia, and their S400 system will never be integrated into NATO's AD systems. 

Of course Erdogan ignored all of this believing Trump had his back. Erdogan then proceeded to FAFO and purchase the S400 system and received delivery. Then 5 days after receiving their first shipment for the S400 system US followed through on their threats leaving Erdogan shocked realizing Trump is a liar just like himself. Later Turkey was even blocked from purchasing F16s.

ETA: Word on the street is that Turkey's S400 systems are sitting in warehouses collecting dust. They have already stated intentions of replacing it with their own home built system.",1689956629.0,1689956243.0,t3_155cswi,t1_jsvahhv,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

They did? Source on that?

US sent F-15 fighters to Turkey before the incident to help them out. After the incident the US backed Turkeys claim of an incursion. 

After a few months of Russia squeezing Turkey, there was a convenient ""coup attempt"", then the pilots involved in shooting down the Russian plane were arrested and accused of being Gulenist.

Propaganda 1. Nuclear threats. RU hoping and praying the world scares itself into backing down. Nothing but hot air. RU elite and leadership and their families have absolutely no incentive to actually do this.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

Propaganda 2. Russia is irrational. RU is very rational, their goals are taking over Ukraine or as much land as they can manage. That's it. But it helps their scare tactics of brinkmanship if everyone thinks they're irrational, just because they're doing horrible things that normal people would never condone, and the simplest explanation most people naturally fall back to is ""oh they must be crazy"" so RU leans right into that perspective and reinforces it. If they were actually irrational they would do actual irrational things, like disband the military and outlaw pretzels and change the national religion to Scientology.

Ask yourself this - if you are Russia right noe and you really don't want the west to escalate and damage your military even more, what do you do?  You can't actually stop the west from taking these actions, so you try your best to scare them into not doing it and *especially* to scare the general public into not supporting it by promoting statements like ""they're so irrational that they really might have launched their nukes if the west pushed for full escalation"".

 Second, a prolonged war is going to be much more expensive for nato as well.

It's not similar - it's exactly right. They haven't used their real air forces yet, at least not to the full extent of their capabilities.
