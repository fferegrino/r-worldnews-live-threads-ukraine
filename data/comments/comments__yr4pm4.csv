Day 260 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had no missile strikes and no drones, so it was very quiet yet again. We only had a single air raid alert today, and it was uneventful as usual, which is a good thing. Apparently the part of Kharkiv oblast that is closer to the Russian border still continues to get shelled every day, and that probably won’t stop until the war ends, but at least it doesn’t go unpunished, as Russian positions in Belgorod oblast are shelled regularly as well.

Even though people are still skeptical about Russian retreat from Kherson, so far it looks to be the repeat of Kharkiv front; it certainly does seem to disintegrate just as fast. A lot of people were predicting that it will take them weeks to leave Kherson, but at the pace it’s going right now I don’t think that it will take them more than a week, because we are getting reports of a new town being liberated almost every hour.

Mykolaiv’s governor is already hinting at Chornobaivka being liberated, which would mean that we are already just outside of Kherson; there are also reports of gunfights happening in Kherson’s suburbs right now. Another good thing that will happen once Russians leave Kherson is that they won’t be able to shell Mykolaiv any longer, which is what they were doing daily all this time. Same thing happened when Russians were thrown out of Kharkiv oblast, they weren’t in range anymore, so the shelling just stopped.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,yr4pm4,ivsreo4,"*Marine Gleb Stryzhko, defender of Mariupol:*

He and his unit entered the outskirts of Mariupol on Feb 27.  They were stationed at the Ilych Metal Plant (the largest of the steel plants).  In April, he was still there. While positioning himself on the 4th floor of a building to gauge the enemy, he encountered Russian fire, fell four floors, landed with a stove and rubble on him.  He had to wait till nightfall for his guys to evacuate him to the medical unit. 

He’d cracked his pelvis in six places, broken his jaw, chipped numerous teeth, and his eyes were severely damaged and he couldn’t see.  Things then got worse:

> Unfortunately, the breakthrough from the combine units was not successful. The ring around us narrowed. Our medics entered the room where I and about 15 other wounded people were lying and said, ‘The plant is surrounded, a flag with the number 300 has been raised over the hospital. In order to save your life, you will be handed over to the Russian side, which has pledged to provide you help. This is an opportunity to survive.’ Since we could no longer resist the enemy and did not even have weapons, we took this as an order.

Still unable to see, move, or articulate words, Gleb was loaded in an ambulance with another wounded defender.

> That guy asked the driver: ‘Are you ours?’ He answered: ‘Now it is not clear who is ours and who is yours. You are under the protection of the DNR.’ Then I realized that the situation is interesting. We arrived at Novoazovsk hospital. 


Gleb’s condition was both a blessing and a curse—he wasn’t sent to prison, tortured, etc—but he also wasn’t given adequate medical care.

He was moved around to various hospitals, not even given a cast, bc hospitals were overwhelmed, and also he’s an ‘enemy’.  He says he got lucky, someone walking by asked him something, and when he tried speaking, the man recognized he had a broken jaw, revealed himself as an oral surgeon and said that he needed his jaw stabilized. “Don’t go anywhere,” the doctor unintentionally-humorously said to the invalid, later returning with a second surgeon. He’s grateful because had that not happened, he’d never be able to speak right as it was healing incorrectly. 

Despite being unable to move, having a colostomy bag, a catheter, his severely fractured pelvis was not set, stabilized.  He also wasn’t given pain meds.  

After a month in captivity, he was among wounded POWs sent back.  He’s now had surgeries, had pins put in, had months of rehab and physical therapy. He’s regained vision, but it is damaged. 

Asked his plans for his future—he wants to return to the front.

Look, I know the *meme* is that if you want to predict Russia's strategy, you just come up with the dumbest plan possible. But in reality, I think the actual best predictors are 1) the sunk cost fallacy, and 2) not wanting to get NATO (even more) involved. So many of their decisions make some sort of sense if you look at it as Putin desperately trying to get *some* sort of victory that won't have him ousted, but without prompting NATO to do something like putting boots on the ground or promoting the entire Black Sea fleet to submarine. And we've seen this throughout the war, like with dirty bombs, biological weapons, secret US nukes... Russia will claim something as potential pretext for a false flag, NATO reminds them why it'd be a horrifically stupid idea, and they back down. So because everyone largely stopped talking about the Kakhovka dam (although I'll grant that Zelenskyy mentioned it recently), I think it's safe to assume it's another case like that. Russia may have been *considering* it, but NATO scared them straight, and because rule 2 is ""don't get NATO involved"", they're probably not actually going to blow it up",False,1668092467.0,t3_yr4pm4,t3_yr4pm4,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

>
>Milley also did something which, I think, no US official has done so far during this war…he went public about the extent of Ukrainian losses. Saying they were comparable to Russian losses, which were approx 100,000. This public statement would have been unthinkable weeks ago.
>
>So let’s look back to last week… First, the @washingtonpost was briefed that US officials had told @ZelenskyyUa to drop the “no talks ever with Putin” rhetoric.
>
>Then the @WSJ ran a piece about contacts between @POTUS’s National security advisor Jake Sullivan and his Russian counterparts about avoiding escalation.
>
>Zelensky seemed to, subtly, oblige early this week by stating he’s open to negotiating, but he mapped out Ukraine’s clear red lines, saying that (I paraphrase) Ukraine’s sovereignty is not up for grabs.
>
>The US Ambo to the UN then comes to Kyiv with a message of reassurance, and makes clear reference to @ZelenskyyUa’s remarks which I reference above.
>
>Meanwhile, Russian rhetoric begins to dial down from September’s bellicose nuclear threats. They try and frame any potential negotiation as one between Russia and the US. That’s disingenuous but clearly the US has real leverage.
>
>And then, after weeks of briefings by “western officials” about a possible Russian retreat from Kherson, Moscow makes the announcement.
>
>A Russian retreat would create - in the south - a hard frontline, with the vast Dnipro river dividing the two sides (the Ukrainians on the western back and the Russians on the eastern bank). The caveat here is that this “retreat” still needs to play out.
>
>The point here is that once the Ukrainians take up new positions on the western bank of the Dnipro, any military offensive across the river would be incredibly hard and incredibly risky.
>
>It is entirely possible that this hard boundary separating Russian and Ukrainian forces in the south will be seen by some as another reason why a negotiated solution (however hard that is to imagine) has to be found. I’ll explore that in a bit…
>
>Then, up steps General Milley with his comments last night. These were not casual remarks. They would have been carefully thought through. It’s also important to note that he also said that if negotiations fail, the US will keep arming Ukraine.
>
>Any path to a negotiated settlement will be fiendishly hard to achieve. Ukraine negotiated with Putin for the best part of 7 years and it only brought a full-scale invasion.
>
>The atrocities committed by the Russian military, on a mass scale, in Ukraine have hardened attitudes and the belief that Putin can never be trusted and that the only way out of the war is to defeat Russia on the battlefield.
>
>It’s hard to imagine Zelensky could accept anything less than pre-February lines. But that would surely be unacceptable to Putin. This is an overly simplistic characterization but it illustrates how difficult any negotiation would be - especially when you throw in public opinion.
>
>Just to be clear, Ukraine (as a whole) would NOT be happy with pre-February lines - the notion that they should have to give up any of their land to a murderous dictator who doesn’t even recognize their nation’s right to exist is anathema for them.

I know you mean well, but I think we could all use a refresher on information hygiene here. It's helpful to distinguish a claim that is being reported but not yet visually verified with video or photos. I recommend that, if you want to copy paste a tweet directly into an update, just put quotes around the claim you're pasting so that it's clear you're just citing a claim someone is making, rather than appearing that you're interpreting a report or video.

I read your post to be a link to a video of Bayraktars attacking Russian formations, so I was confused to find it's just a tweet saying the same thing you're saying. And the tweet you copy-pasted isn't even necessarily accurately interpreting the Russian report that it is citing. The Russian report says that air defenses have been moved out of that area, and then the tweet you pasted is interpreting that to mean that Bayraktars have been destroying Russian forces.

I realize this may come across as finicky, but it's helpful during another big wave of breaking news. When people don't put quotes around the claims they are sharing, it can cause others to assume it's verified information and then they share it with others and largely untrue rumors spread and cause frustration later when they are inconsistent with other reports.",1668138131.0,1668137194.0,t3_yr4pm4,t1_ivwgj1y,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

Russia will likely have to make sovereign concessions  of the Arctic to the West, to the point of joining our “sphere of influence.”

It is punishment for their crimes. They will be deprived of Eurasia and will trade exclusively with the West (maybe we can make an exception for China?) to compensate it for the losses it incurred due to the relentless information warfare and the invasion of a now Allied nation, Ukraine.

Kherson on the other hand was a foregone conclusion. As soon as Ukraine had the ability to interdict any fixed crossing point of the Dniper, maintaining such a large force in the west bank of the river  became ludicrous, i think it may have happened earlier than Russia was planning, probably because they didn't expect the Kerch bridge to get hit.

So i think losing the west bank of the river will ultimately not feel like a huge deal for Russia. It's a big hit in terms of propaganda, considering that Russia jumped the gun by publicly ""annexing it"", but in terms of the overall military situation is not that big of loss. The river will hold Ukraine from attempting any crossing because it would be ridiculous for Ukraine to attempt to cross the river in force in order to continue the counter attack all the way to Crimea - like i've seen some suggest over the past few months - .

2. Ukrainian sympathy or apathy. They made the assumption, probably based on intelligence from their agents in Ukraine, that Ukrainian citizens would be largely demoralized by the removal of Zelenskyy, if not enthusiastic about his replacement. Instead, grandmothers started making molotovs and welders started making tank traps.

3. Western subtlety. It's hard to say what they expected from the West, but they appear to have at least anticipated minimal reaction, particularly from US intelligence prior to the invasion.

0c344ca33f7c6dbc3748813e874cac5d,yr4pm4,ivwfgln,"Russia expected three things that didn't happen the way the planned.

First, they expected Ukraine to collapse quickly after the Russians had taken Kiev in the first few days of a skilled and efficient operation.  After all, that's exactly what happened in Crimea.  Instead, the corruption of the Russian oligarchs over the past 20 years took it's toll on the remnants of the old Soviet military and the operation got bogged down, giving Ukraine time to mobilize and fight back.  That turned a 3 day operation into a long-term war.

Second, the Russians expected that Germany would do everything in their power to ensure that no real action was taken to stop them because they were so dependent on Russian natural gas.  If Germany refused to stop importing gas, the rest of Europe would have followed suit.  The Russians were right on this one, but they completely underestimated the third factor, Joe Biden.

So third, the Russians thought that Biden would react much like Obama did in 2014 when they invaded Crimea.  They expected a few harmless sanctions and a lot of saber rattling, but no real action.  Instead, Biden was nearly a lone voice sounding the alarm even before the invasion began.  His team used propaganda effectively by announcing Russian plans before they could even give orders to the troops.  He pushed a NATO command that had somewhat fragmented during the Trump years into action as a single, cohesive team.  This in turn forced Germany to grow a spine and join the rest of NATO in helping Ukraine with real aid, both civilian and military.  I've criticized Biden for a few things, but in this, he played the game like a true master.  He beat back Russia's puppets in the US media and took the lead on ensuring Ukraine had a fighting chance to beat back the invader.

Basically, Russia's plan made a lot of sense, except that they didn't think that the West would actually stand up with real aid.   Obviously, they were wrong.",False,1668134542.0,t3_yr4pm4,t1_ivvxxam,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

It wasn't in Georgia or in 2014. People weren't thrilled, but NordStream 2 was announced in 2015 so the Europeans couldn't be too bothered by it. Russia took 20% of Georgia in 2008 and Obama has a big show about 'resetting' relationships afterwards. 

Was there good reason to think it would be different this time, yes. But there was also good reason to think it would be the same. It was a gamble, and Putin is a gambler. You have to be to dictator. A more cautious and careful person would never get the power Putin has. You've got to be willing to take huge risks, be a good judge of risks, and have luck. 

Unfortunately, luck runs out. You never know when you're about to make a wrong bet, and Putin did this time. 

>I don't see a scenario where this war could ever end with them in a good position, even if they had taken Ukraine.

The plan wasn't to take Ukraine. The plan was regime change. Jump in, change the government, jump out and dare anyone to do something about it after the fact. The US had just lost a 20 year long war in Afghanistan. There's a good chance we were going to enter a isolationist phase and leave europe to europe. And Europe, well, Europe relied on Russian energy. Covid hammered european economies. Ukraine was seen as a corrupt backwater that was basically russian, why would europe risk it's economy for that? Oh sure Poland and the Baltics might scream bloody murder, but they don't control the EU. France and Germany do. And France and Germany like us. France is, in 2021, preparing to sell us warships. They obviously don't care about Ukraine. 

And Ukraine? Putin believes what he says. He doesn't think Ukraine is a real country. He thinks Ukrainians are Russians with some western backed elites on the top, that the actual people of Ukraine, russians, don't care about. He thought the Ukrainian government would crumble just like the western backed Afghan government did.

Putin didn't plan for a war. He planned for a coup. He got a war, and has been scrambling to come up with a plan ever since. In this he is like Hitler. Hitler didn't plan to fight Poland. He didn't plan to fight France and Britain. He didn't plan to fight America. He planned to have the Poles ally with Germany and fight the Soviets. He planned for less than half the war he got.

FUCKING YES.

That's exactly what Ukraine needs. Tie down as many as possible. Last thing they want is all those assholes getting to fight another day. Better to just tie them in place completely and not pick a fight, but still stop them leaving, but even if that's not possible it's better to fight them now with supplies cut off than in a month from now where they have freer logistics.

The second area is the south-eastern front. Its the worst kept secret in the world that Ukraine would love to push south toward Mariupol ASAP and break the ""land bridge to Crimea"", something that has been rumored to be a major goal of this war.

The US has interests in protecting its embassy in Kiev and can use that as justification for a stationing action there consisting of aircraft, special forces, and air defense artillery. 

Depending on the outcome of the war, the US, UN, or NATO can vie for a peace monitoring force at the agreed upon border. 

One of the other turns in the post negotiations settlement is leasing a part of a port to US or NATO. The justification could be the rebuilding of naval logistics capabilities damaged by Russia and the basing of a naval peace monitoring force but what a permanent base would do is give NATO ships stationed there right of passage under the Montreaux Doctrine to pass through the Bosporus. 

There are other opportunities. Russian peace keepers should be ejected out of Transnistria on the South West border of Ukraine.

She felt that voting for Russia would betray her son [in Ukraine’s military], but she feared voting no. “They’ll shoot me if I don’t vote,” she said. Her husband intervened, accusing the soldiers of impersonating election officials, and they left without signatures.

So for example for two weeks (roughly last week of October and the first week of November) it will give you a number of around  6700 soldiers, or 478 RU soldiers per day MIA, KIA or captured. That's actually surprisingly close to the numbers that Ukrainians are posting. Long term the trend is pretty close and as we cannot get all the information about such findings, we can safely assume that's the lower bracket with Ukrainian data being the higher bracket. As I checked the data long-term it there is a correlation between what Ukraine is saying and the data collected with the methods listed above. So as a rule of thumb it's actually pretty close to take the Ukrainian published number, substract 25% and be in the ballpark of actual value. Which honestly comes as surprise for me.

Firstly consider the useful military population. Ukraine’s is 100% committed to this war on their home soil, they don’t need to defend the Polish border, they don’t need to fight in Syria, they don’t need a fleet, a space force, submarines, ICBMs, satellite analysts, any of that. Russia pretends to be a global power and that means they have all of these military commitments other than Ukraine that are large draws of manpower and materiel. Ukraine doesn’t do any of that stuff, that’s all being done by the west on their behalf, they don’t need thousands of intelligence analysts, they just need to read the reports given to them by NATO. They don’t need nuclear armed bombers circling the Arctic or nuclear subs, the US has those. Their military is far more focused on the task at hand than Russia’s.

Secondly the wider national context is again far more focused on the task at hand. Russia needs to function as a state outside of war, war is just one of the things it does. It also needs to maintain industry for both war and civilian needs, it needs to feed itself, to export to balance its budget, to police internal dissent, to do all of the other shit it needs to do so that it can go fight in Ukraine. Ukraine has a much better time there too. Ukraine doesn’t need to reserve a large portion of its manpower to meeting the needs of the war machine, everyone else is donating what they need, all of those men are freed up to fight. They don’t need to worry too much about domestic needs either, again, the west will pay. They don’t need a strong export industry to supply dollars for vital imports, we just give them the dollars. They basically only need to do one thing, kill Russians.

That’s why we’ve seen such a numerical superiority for Ukraine on the battlefield. They’re committed to the war in a way that Russia can’t be. Russia has to do dozens of non military things so that it can spare the resources needed to engage in military things, and half of those don’t actually help them win in Ukraine. Ukraine doesn’t have to do those. It’s population directly involved in fighting is many times higher than Russia’s.",False,1668079259.0,t3_yr4pm4,t1_ivswg58,,2,22,0,22,0,0,

It's possible that it was Ukraine that was waiting; and once they realized that Uncle Joe was going to continue to have their back if they pushed through Kherson, they went ahead.

For example; had the trumphumpers won decisively, and immediately started dismantling support for Kyiv, then Ukraine might have found themselves overextended 2 months from now.

I've seen it argued here dozens of times (as pro trump election propaganda) that Republicans were going to continue to support Ukraine because this was supposedly bipartisan and popular among Republicans - but that was only because the Democrats held power, and the Republicans had to deal with them to reach compromises (on other issues).  

But it was very clear that the trumphumper faction of the Republicans were planning, on obstructing EVERYTHING they had the power to obstruct - including the budget ceiling measure. They could have, for example, shut down the government due to hitting the spending ceiling. (yes, it's a fucking stupid law, but it's their creation and they're going to use it).  They can literally blackmail the entire country into letting them get what they want.  When they withhold that ceiling resolution, the government literally can not spend any more money until there is an agreement. So even money that congress has already appropriated, CANT BE SPENT.  That includes lend lease. That includes Biden's appropriation measures. The only money the government can spend are bare minimum essential things like social security, and public safety measures. 

I can tell you, that defense contractors literally have to stop working on whatever contracts are on.  They basically have to sit on their asses doing nothing for 2 or 4 weeks or longer. Sometimes getting furloughed, and losing pay.  Projects die during these shutdowns. Jobs end, as workers seek more stable employment in the private sector (lol).  Careers end. The effect of these shutdowns ends up costing way more than if they just let the government continue.  

So yes - there was a very real possibility that the Republicans could have halted aid to Ukraine.  Luckily, the voters finally showed some common sense for once.

McCain had basically no time. Flipped through a rolodex and some pictures. Sarah Palin sounded fine on paper. Alaska governor. Photogenic. Quick phone call. Okay. Done deal.

The answer to that is *no,* at least *not yet.* *Never,* unless we have the Arctic as leverage.

This isn't the same for Ukraine.  It's in Ukrains strategic long term interests to stockpile heavy equipment, both allied supplied and captured, and to deny Russia the use of theirs.  Ukraine can do this most effectively by putting just enough pressure on Kherson that allows platoon sized units to abandon equipment cross over on foot into relative saftey.

- amphibious landing (not going to happen, not equipped for it, won't be equipped for it, and would be too slow if they tried)

Of course there's a cost, but it'll be smaller in men to kill them while they're weakened and cut off than to let them go. And cities can be rebuilt. It's probably going to be shelled over the next few weeks anyway, same as Kharkiv was.

>fuck them up while they're weak

They are as strong and well equiped as they'll ever be, in a highly defensible position.

Edit: I mean, why do you THINK they're hunkered in the city proper?  Because that's where the Russians feel the weakest?  Or because that's where they feel the strongest?  The city is where they think (and their right) they have the best shot to hold on. You don't want to fight them just because they're there, you want them to move from a position of relative strength to one of relative weakness.",1668122146.0,1668121311.0,t3_yr4pm4,t1_ivvjogp,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
