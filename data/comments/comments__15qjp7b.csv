>  
>Wagner mercenaries were within shouting distance when the ambush began.  
>  
>From the high ground, they raked a column of Ukrainian military armor below. An antitank rocket punched through Ilia Mykhalchuk’s vehicle, and the 36-year-old recalled quickly taking stock of his injuries.  
>  
>They were ghastly.  
>  
>Right arm: ribbons of shredded flesh. His left: pocked with shrapnel.  
>  
>Mykhalchuk stumbled from the burning wreckage, fell to the frozen ground and, using his fractured teeth for leverage, tightened a tourniquet onto each of his mangled arms. Moments later, his attackers drew near, shooting him through the legs. They moved closer. Death, Mykhalchuk believed, was imminent.  
>  
>“I was sure,” he recently recalled, “they wouldn’t capture me.”  
>  
>Yet that is exactly what happened.  
>  
>Mykhalchuk spent six weeks as a prisoner of the Wagner Group, Russia’s contract army whose savage campaign to capture the eastern city of Bakhmut cost thousands of lives over the winter and spring and left thousands more, including Mykhalchuk, grievously wounded. The months-long siege so disillusioned and enraged Wagner boss Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who personally oversaw the fighting, that in June he took the extraordinary step of staging a rebellion, marching on Moscow in a stunning — if fleeting — threat to President Vladimir Putin’s hold on power.  
>  
>Mykhalchuk was freed in a prisoner exchange in April, having spent 46 days in captivity, during which he lost both arms to amputation by Wagner medics who, he said, neglected to suture his skin after the procedure. In interviews with The Washington Post, he gave a breathtaking account of his captors’ alleged barbarism and mind-bending efforts to break the will of Ukrainian soldiers they had taken off the battlefield.  
>  
>Following corrective surgeries in Ukraine, Mykhalchuk was brought to the United States by a consortium of charitable groups for intensive rehabilitation. He’s now in the Washington area at a specialized facility outfitting him with arm prosthetics from a company with deep expertise treating American troops who lost limbs while at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The interrogations were unrelenting. When he would lose consciousness, he said, he was injected with an unknown substance to keep him awake so they could continue.  
>  
>His captors did not appear interested in tactical information, such as Ukrainian troop locations or other potentially useful intelligence. There were higher-ranking prisoners whom Wagner could have pressed for such information, Mykhalchuk said. Instead, he surmises that his value to Wagner was merely to be tortured psychologically. His interrogators made light of his amputations, telling him, he said, that he would never fight again...  
>  
>Wagner’s strategy, he said, appeared designed to undermine the Ukrainians’ values and to make them question how their countrymen would view them after release from captivity. The Wagner fighters sought to splinter the soldiers’ solidarity and, alluding to their experiences fighting in other conflict zones, showed cunning proficiency when it came to manipulation.  
>  
>“They tried to make us believe that we couldn’t trust each other, and that it was a kill-or-be-killed situation,” he said. “They were just playing with us, the way a cat plays with a mouse — when he catches it before he kills it.”  
>  
>Wagner fighters are known to be a volatile mix of serious soldiers and unpredictable convicts drawn from the Russian prison population, Mykhalchuk said. But the Wagner soldiers in the basement of his makeshift prison were professional, he said. He didn’t know their names. Many appeared to exhibit greater respect for Ukrainians like him who were captured while fighting, but less for those who had surrendered — they were treated with derision.  
>  
>Some prisoners were physically tortured, he said, but he did not witness it. The harshest abuse came in moments of capture, rather than in the basement. Some Ukrainians had their fingers cut off, he said. One man detained alongside him in the basement was set on fire with gasoline before being taken.

On the night of August 12th/early 13th initial reports came out about a Russian withdrawal from Urozhaine. This was mentioned by various smaller Russian TG channels, including the Vostok Battalion, a DPR unit fighting in the village. They said they were in the process of losing the village after several days of fierce fighting. 

The main Ukrainian push against Urozhaine started 2 weeks ago when RU were pushed out of Staromaiorske. UA began attacking Urozhaine directly from the north adjacent to a local road from Velyka Novosilka, and once they solidified control of Staromaiorske they crossed the Mokri Yaly River and attacked Urozhaine's western flank. 

The attacks across the river didn't achieve much territorial success (thus Urozhaine wasn't encircled), but it did spread the Russian defenders thin and further attrit them. ~Aug 8th UA started clearing the minefields north of Urozhaine and attacked the trenches in the settlement's northern outskirts. By August 10th it was confirmed that the 37th Marine Brigade overran these defenses and RU retreated towards the village center. 

The Russian defense consisted of elements of the DPR's Vostok and Kaskad Battalions, the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade + 247th Air Assault Regiment and 60th Motor Rifle Brigade reported more generally in the Vremivka salient. 

UA overran the defenders by sending small groups deep into Urozhaine. Eventually they were spotted and firefights broke out. UA squads then withdrew and fired artillery on the known RU positions. A major complaint from RU sources on the ground in Zaporizhia for a while now has been the lack of counter-battery fire, and it seems this was also an issue for RU's defense of Urozhaine. 

We still haven't seen any footage to confirm the entire capture of the village, and the pro-Ukraine Deep State map still shows RU in control of the southern warehouses, but official reports/footage always lags behind the actual developments on the ground. So we'll just have to wait and see if more new comes out today. 

Urozhaine's capture will allow UA to continue advancing south along the Mokri Yaly River valley on both sides of the river towards a local RU defensive node/logistical hub Staromlynivka. UA can now also push south through the fields east of Urozhaine to the Staromlynivka-Kermenchyk line, a minor trench line 5km north of the main defensive line in the region.

>His account provides a rare window into the fighting in Ukraine from a Russian inmate’s perspective. Units made up of convicts have become one of the cornerstones of Russian military strategy as the prolonged fighting has decimated the country’s regular forces. Aleksandr’s descriptions could not be independently confirmed, but they aligned with accounts from Ukrainian soldiers and Russian prisoners of war who said that Moscow used inmates essentially as cannon fodder.

Criticisms of Russian brigades in Donetsk arose after Ukrainian forces advanced in the area of Urozhaine on Aug. 10. One author claimed that Russian soldiers ""prematurely withdrew"" because ""the unit's personnel were drunk,"" the ISW reported.

While some objected to this characterization, other voices in the Russian information space echoed and expanded these complaints, according to the ISW.

One author attributed Russian defensive failures on the front to the dismissal of a unit commander, Major General Ivan Popov.

The bloggers ""targeted their complaints at the personnel of these units rather than the unit or theater commanders, suggesting that Popov’s removal and other rumored command purges may have removed mid-level Russian military commanders as a readily available scapegoat for Russian military failures,"" the ISW wrote.

The ISW also said that Russian commander Alexander Khodakovsky, who leads a battalion near Urozhaine, acknowledged on Aug. 13 that ""Russia expended its resources too early in the war.""",False,1691990287.0,t3_15qjp7b,t3_15qjp7b,,0,68,0,68,0,0,

Dagestan, one of the most corrupt regions in Russia, is just the first domino to fall due to systemic failures that affect the rest of Putin's crumbling empire. The root cause of a lot of recent disasters is wide-scale construction without investing into infrastructure. Typical for Putin, his officials double-dip: they profit off of illegal construction, and they flat-out steal from utilities. Secondly, Dagestan is a majorly non-ethnically Russian region that has been one of the hardest-hit by war casualties and conscription. There aren't enough qualified specialists left to smoothly run the already skeletal infrastructure. 

In the latest chapter, a giant explosion took place in the capital Makhachkala a few hours ago. The explosion was right next to a newly constructed mall. There are scant details:

> A building caught fire near the Globus shopping center, the city administration reports. Eyewitnesses talk about a loud explosion in a car service. The fire later spread to a gas station.

> According to the Dagestan Center for Disaster Medicine, five people were killed in the explosion and another ten were injured. At the same time, the telegram channel Baza reported that more than 50 people were injured as a result of the incident. According to Shot there are at least 70 victims.

https://t\.me/rtvimain/81881

Other telegram videos show post-apocalyptic scenes in a hospital as more and more victims are brought in.

https://t\.me/ostorozhno_novosti/18689

This is happening in the background of a major heatwave. Large swaths of population have been without electricity and water on and off, sparking spontaneous protests.

> Dagestan’s ongoing utilities crisis saw another major protest on Sunday night. The residents of Karaman-2, a settlement outside of the region’s capital Makhachkala, blocked the federal Makhachkala–Astrakhan highway, trying to draw attention to the dire water-supply situation in the area.

> According to some participants, their homes had been without running water for the whole summer. 

> On August 9, Makhachkala residents resorted to similar tactics to protest power supply disruptions that left many Dagestani homes without electricity for three days in a row,

>The Case for a Ukrainian Nuclear Deterrent  
>  
>John J. Mearsheimer  
>  
>THE LOGIC OF PROLIFERATION  
>  
>Most Western observers want Ukraine to rid itself of nuclear weapons as quickly as possible. In this view, articulated recently by President Bill Clinton, Europe would be more stable if Russia were to become ""the only nuclear-armed successor state to the Soviet Union."" The United States and its European allies have been pressing Ukraine to transfer all of the nuclear weapons on its territory to the Russians, who naturally think this is an excellent idea. President Clinton is wrong. The conventional wisdom about Ukraine's nuclear weapons is wrong. In fact, as soon as it declared independence, Ukraine should have been quietly encouraged to fashion its own nuclear deterrent. Even now, pressing Ukraine to become a non-nuclear state is a mistake.  
>  
>A nuclear Ukraine makes sense for two reasons. First, it is imperative to maintain peace between Russia and Ukraine. That means ensuring that the Russians, who have a history of bad relations with Ukraine, do not move to reconquer it. Ukraine cannot defend itself against a nuclear-armed Russia with conventional weapons, and no state, including the United States, is going to extend to it a meaningful security guarantee. Ukrainian nuclear weapons are the only reliable deterrent to Russian aggression. If the U.S. aim is to enhance stability in Europe, the case against a nuclear-armed Ukraine is unpersuasive.  
>  
>Second, it is unlikely that Ukraine will transfer its remaining nuclear weapons to Russia, the state it fears most. The United States and its European allies can complain bitterly about this decision, but they are not in a position to force Ukraine to go non-nuclear.

They are actually a bit bad against trenches as they have a high Area of Effect but low damage output meaning if the explosions are not directly on the person it does not move the earth enough to hurt them.

A classic shell even if it does not land in the trench could push enough earth to collapse it.

They are ideal for hitting moving unsheltered troops such as walking or vehicles as they might not destroy a vehicle but could easily take out tires or weak points.

That is my understanding of the weapon. If they could control the way they explode, such as exploding in a rectangular fashion that lines up over a trench they might be better than a regular shell. If they explode like a circle over a linear trench they do a bit less. Could be good if a trench whinds over itself.

Anyhow just having more shells is great for them in general since they don't need to conserve ammo.

So there will be around 3100 Ukrainian children losing an arm or dying slowly for each child that gets splattered by a full conventional shell during the 2030s.  (Most of the child splattering a limb removal will come from Russian ammunition.  We are talking per shell effects)  

Ordinance has unique properties.  In general the area of effect follows a square-cubed law.  Blast energy dissipates by cube of distance.  The expanding sphere is a surface so its squared.  633 munitions 633^(1/3) =  8.6. So your source fot 8x as effective might be a reasonable source or at least they can do basic math.  

However, cluster munitions would be near useless for something like demolition.  Recall the pictures of bridge deck with holes through the deck and wider circle of crumbled concrete.  A spread of small explosives would create chips over an 8.6x larger area but not create the big hole at all.  The Russian could have just swept it with a broom and continued driving on it.  

Ammunition effectiveness is usually the radius where it can create a small hole.  For fleshy targets it generally does not matter if the hole is large.  If you had a brad nail buried in your thigh you would have to go to a doctor to get it removed.  Light armor can stop small shrapnel.  The DPICM gets around that by using a shaped charge along with shrapnel.  So, for example, if you dug a hole and covered it with a door and a little dirt the shaped charge might still put a small hole through the door and cause an injury.  The mini bunker would still be intact and usable.  Whereas a direct hit with a 155mm shell could covert the door into wood chips and leave only a crater.  

Top down can be more effective against trenches.  People tend to dismiss this when talking mortar vs howitzer.  

The M31 AW rounds are better because the burst height can be adjusted.  It sends a shower of 180,000 tungsten ball munitions.  They are quite effective against vehicles and body armor/helmets.  They could use a higher burst level if aiming for fleshy targets which would cover a much larger area.  A guided missile can attack from any angle unless the target is at maximum range.  .",False,1692027711.0,t3_15qjp7b,t1_jw54mai,,1,-22,0,-22,0,0,

At the same time their exports are being reduced because of the sanctions, especially refined products have dropped a lot leading to import export disparity. China and India are not interested in importing any more of refined products than they used to, so the reduction of customer base has linearly cut back the sales of these categories.

>  
>Nabiullina explained that the ruble — which had initially plummeted beyond 100 against the dollar as war broke out in Ukraine — managed to restrengthen last year thanks to a surge in export proceeds and a fall in imports. However, now the situation has reversed, as a sharp fall in exports means far less foreign currency is entering Russia.  
>  
>“If we compare the positive current account in the first quarter \[of 2023\], then compared to last year's peak, it fell five times, so the floating rate is changing under the influence of foreign trade,” Nabiullina added.  
>  
>Meanwhile, Bloomberg economist Alex Isakov said months of capital outflows from Russia were the primary driver of a weakening ruble, but also pointed out that Russian companies were bringing less foreign currency into the country.  
>  
>“Some of this is due to increased settlement in local currencies that results in revenue getting stuck in import countries' banks. But increasingly exporters also prefer just to keep their export proceeds offshore,” he wrote on Twitter.

> Most important of all: Putin understood that Ukraine’s fate was more important to Russia than it was to the West. Please note: It is by no means more important to Russia than it is to Ukrainians, who are making enormous sacrifices to defend their country. But Putin has the advantage over Ukraine’s principal supporters when it comes to being willing to bear costs and run risks. He has an advantage not because Western leaders are weak, pusillanimous, or craven, but because the political alignment of a large country right next door to Russia was always bound to matter more to Moscow than it was going to matter to people farther away, and especially to individuals living in a wealthy and secure country on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

> This situation also explains why Ukrainians— and their loudest supporters in the West— have gone to enormous lengths to link their country’s fate to lots of unrelated issues. If you listen to them, Russian control over Crimea or any portion of the Donbas would be a fatal blow to the “rules-based international order,” an invitation to China to seize Taiwan, a boon to autocrats everywhere, a catastrophic failure of democracy, and a sign that nuclear blackmail is easy and that Putin could use it to march his army all the way to the English Channel. Hard-liners in the West make arguments like this to make Ukraine’s fate appear as important to us as it is to Russia, but such scare tactics don’t stand up to even casual scrutiny. The future course of the 21st century is not going to be determined by whether Kyiv or Moscow ends up controlling the territories they are currently fighting over, but rather by which countries control key technologies, by climate change, and by political developments in many other places.

> Recognizing this asymmetry also explains why nuclear threats have only limited utility and why fears of nuclear blackmail are misplaced. As Thomas Schelling wrote many years ago, because a nuclear exchange is such a fearsome prospect, bargaining under the shadow of nuclear weapons becomes a “competition in risk taking.” Nobody wants to use even one nuclear weapon, but the side that cares more about a particular issue will be willing to run greater risks, especially if vital interests are at stake. For this reason, we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that Russia would use a nuclear weapon if it were about to suffer a catastrophic defeat, and this realization places limits on how far we should be willing to push it. Again, not because Western leaders are weak-willed or craven, but because they are sensible and prudent.

> Does this mean we are succumbing to “nuclear blackmail”? Could Putin use such threats to win additional concessions elsewhere? The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears. Imagine Putin calling Biden and saying that he might launch a nuclear strike if the United States refused to cede Alaska back to Russia. Biden would laugh and tell him to call back when he was sober. A rival’s coercive nuclear threats have little or no credibility when the balance of resolve favors us, and it is worth remembering that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union ever engaged in successful nuclear blackmail during the long Cold War—even against non-nuclear states— despite the enormous arsenals at their disposal.",False,1692023236.0,t3_15qjp7b,t1_jw4udla,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

A literal moron.  There are many children reading this page right now with more common sense, and certainly more knowledge, than that man.  

Neuralink started out (not by Musk) doing commercial research for the visually-impaired.  And most of what they were into had already been done before, so it wasn't novel work quite yet, though it could be important one day in the right hands and some of it is interesting, *on that basis*, helping the blind a tiny bit.  Musk bought them, rebranded them, decided they should do highly invasive and illegal surgery (which hasn't happened yet because the US government will not allow it) to insert electrode nets *inside* the skull, for undisclosed reasons.  Highly dangerous and stupid and offers zero reward.  Musk, again *based on absolutely nothing*, seems to think it'll lead to mind-computer interfacing, knowing nothing about either computing or biology.  So the company draws up the shit he wants them to on paper, doing nothing with it, accruing more and more bullshit ideas, while churning out corporate TED-talks (that is, advertisements) to investors sponsored by his social media sector.  The investors know almost as little about cog-sci as Musk does, and give him money, which he takes and keeps.  Neuralink is a full-fledged ponzi scheme.  It is operating outside of reality and has no hope of real world application.  What little is left of its workforce are work-from-home paper pushers who are in on the idea of milking the rich and ignorant for primarily Musk's own benefit.

The unexploded munitions is the entire ""issue"" with DPICM.  Without explaining why they suck the discussion does not even make sense.  If you just say 5% it is misleading.  It is 5% *per munition*.  If we are comparing shots fired then you expect 31 unexploded munitions.  

Alternatively we can apply the same squared cubed law.  A single high explosive warhead has 73.7 times the lethal radius.   This would also be highly misleading.  A 200 kg shell is obviously far more lethal than a puny DPICM.

You have people here trying to argue that 8 times the lethal area is ""too fantastic to be plausible"".  It really is a plausible order of magnitude estimate.  You get similar results for straight TNT blast radius.  A ton of TNT at 10x distance is about the same over pressure as a kg of TNT.

First off is the regular army organized into BTG, plus VDV, air forces etc. Roughly 190k combat troops plus some amount of support personnel back inside Russia/Belarus invaded Ukraine on Feb 22.

On top of that you have the force-conscripted colonial militia forces of the DPR/LPR which were roughly 20k strong on the same date, and were the primary cannon fodder of the Russian army in the south against Ukraine's strongest defensive lines even as the battle for Kyiv took all the headlines. As of _a year ago_ there were reports that areas of the DPR/LPR were entirely depopulated of adult males, and even with expanding the conscription to the newly occupied areas to supplement, we've stopped hearing _anything_ about these forces, and they were never integrated into the rest of the Russian armed forces. They have been utterly annihilated, and unlike forces from Russian proper there are no good estimates of the total unique individuals forced into service and subsequently killed or maimed, but based on the reported attrition rates they burned through that 20k number multiple times over. But they're not _Russian_ deaths and aren't counted by any of the official estimates (from non-Ukrainian sources) I've seen . Easily could be 50k+, potentially up to 100k. I don't think anyone really knows.

Second, you have the feudal and mercenary forces, Kadyrovites, Wagner, etc. Wagner lost upwards of 10k KIA in Bakhmut alone, though much of this was prison fodder. Add in the operations they performed elsewhere and that number doubles, 20-25k total deaths. Also not counted as Russian military losses.

Third, you have the Russian-commanded prison units, after they stopped letting Wagner take them all and tried to incorporate them into the normal military structure. Based on the reported scale of this effort vis-a-vis Wagner's losses on Bakhmut, could be 10k also not part of the official counts.

Finally we come to the Russian Army proper, the 190k original invasion force plus the thousands of additional army troops scrounged from across the empire, training instructors, whatever warm military bodies they could bully into going into Ukraine. Supplemented with reactivated reservists and the waves of mobiks (which continue to trickle in), all in all amounting to about 300-500k additional troops. From this group we have over 30k uniquely identified dead individuals, and given the amount of effort the Russian military has put into obfuscating losses and denying death benefits the actual number could realistically be double.

So all in all you are looking at 120k to 200k deaths, which puts it in the same general ballpark as the Ukrainian figures.

Again this is all super speculative on my part, but I feel the logic is sound and extrapolations from minimum confirmed  numbers of deaths.

Then the most reliably sources K:W ratios I have seen put it at 1.5 wounded for every killed soldier since so many Russians die from lack of medical treatment, you have 200-300k more wounded. Out of 600-800k total Russian forces committed which matches with the reports there are maybe 300-350k Russian forces remaining in Ukraine.

Probably because part of you knows that compelled speech, aka forcing people to say something whether they agree or not, is a very slippery slope. Sure it sounds good in this case but once you set a condition where the government can force you to agree with a certain point of view and kick you out if you don't you've given them a power that might be hard to put back into the bottle. One of the things that separate a lot of democratic countries from dictatorships like Russia is that people generally enjoy free speech and can speak their mind, no one demands them to have a certain viewpoint. Forcing someone to agree with a very specific statement targeting one war and country is disregarding one of the underpinnings of a free society.

No, the introduction of a second person doesn't change the percentage possibility of the first person getting a brain tumor.

The only way to stop a nuclear power from gaining something that they deem sufficiently important that they’d take a nuclear risk for is for another nuclear power to also deem it at least as important to themselves so that they’d take a larger nuclear risk to prevent that gain - that’s what Thomas Schelling meant by everything becoming “a competition in nuclear risk taking”. 

It’s a brutal reality, but between nuclear nations that’s the way things inevitably play out: on any specific interest, whoever genuinely wants it more (aka who deems it more essential to their nation’s interests) will prevail - it’s unfortunate and perhaps unfair, but it’s simply what the balance of interest, power and resolve dictates. 

Not only is there no point in ignoring it - arguably the greatest risk to mankind lies in one party simply pretending it weren’t true and trying to bluff in this context, because the party with the upper hand in the balance of resolve (real or perceived by them) will inevitably call that bluff and put us all on the precipice.",False,1692032406.0,t3_15qjp7b,t1_jw5qc2m,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Indeed.  Glad you recognize it.  Each DPICM has a 5% chance of not detonating according to the United States Army.  

>...The amount of wheel winners/munitions duds does increase with more players/munitions,...

Indeed.  Thank you for putting in the effort to state the facts clearly.  I hope anyone reading this will become aware.   

Suppose we (USA is local to me) ship an additional 9000 M31 missiles (1500 HIMARS pods, M31A2 the 200kg HE not the AW) instead of an additional 9000 M26 missiles.  What is the statistical mean number of unexploded munitions in each case?

Edit:  it.occurred to me that no ammunition can kill a Russian soldier more than 100% dead.  No HIMARS missile can kill a Russian soldier more dead than slitting his throat with a bayonet knife.  I am not sure how much that contributes to the discussion of ""weapons effectiveness"".  If we had the ability to kill them, resurrect them, and then kill them again in one strike that weapon would probably get banned in the EU for being unnecessarily cruel.",1692064730.0,1692063620.0,t3_15qjp7b,t1_jw6vewe,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

I see they always need more AA, I saw vids how they had to supply troops on foot - either lacking vehicles or not safe enough for operation, I see Germany sending more mine clearing gear and another Patriot. I see a combat medic in Ukraine that asks vehemently for an ambulance car that she can use. The shell hunger is probably soon gone, but still expect it to be less than 100% for the next months. There are thousands of soldiers who need rehabilitation and prosthetics, that aren't paid for every time, or at least not the best treatment possible I guess. And still see a lot of older troop transporter or IFVs that are death traps more or less.

Not sure how strained logistics are. With so many different vehicles in service now in Ukraine. Probably not the big issue, but some don't want to make Russia lose fast. Sometimes it's better you let them bleed out first before dealing finishing blow. That might be the hope of some leaders. To get a regime change its gonna take more than what happens atm.

The US Army would have only been conquering cinders.  As it was, the bomb damage unit under Leslie Groves predicted that absent a Japanese surrender, Japan would have no city of population 35k or more by the end of 1945.  Those were people that didn't even know about the nukes.
