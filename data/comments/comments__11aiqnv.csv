Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 February 2023  


* Since 2014 Russia’s strategic goal in Ukraine has highly likely been consistent: to control its neighbour. Over 2014-2021, it pursued this objective through subversion, by fomenting an undeclared war in the Donbas, and by annexing Crimea.  

* On 24 February 2022, Russia pivoted to a new approach and launched a full-scale invasion which attempted to seize the whole country and depose its government.  

* By April 2022, Russia realised this had failed, and focused on expanding and formalising its rule over the Donbas and the south. It has made slow and extremely costly progress.  

* In recent weeks, Russia has likely changed its approach again. Its campaign now likely primarily seeks to degrade the Ukrainian military, rather than being focused on seizing substantial new territory.  

* The Russian leadership is likely pursuing a long-term operation where they bank that Russia’s advantages in population and resources will eventually exhaust Ukraine.

>Austin’s comments come as the war in Ukraine reaches the one-year mark, with seemingly no end in sight.

Day 365-366 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a somewhat quiet, there was an attempt at a missile strike aimed at Kharkiv by the Russians, but the missile was shot down. They also fired a couple of missiles at Kupiansk, sadly those weren’t intercepted and they hit an administrative building, though I don’t think anyone died from the strike. Compared to yesterday, today was a very quiet day, which is honestly pretty surprising.

We were expecting new massive missile strikes on the anniversary of the war, but they never happened. We barely even had any air raid alerts today. While yesterday we had 7 alerts here in Kharkiv, today we only had 2 and the day is already almost over. I guess Russians don’t want to celebrate the anniversary of their biggest (so far) failure of this century. Though they still continued to hit Kupiansk even today, and even literally right now, as it is currently being shelled judging by the reports from the locals.

It still feels pretty unbelievable that this war has been already going on for an entire year. Weirdly it feels both, as if it started forever ago, and at the same time as if the first day of the war was just yesterday. The first 3-6 months of the war felt like one extremely long day. Those were the months when Kharkiv was still getting shelled relentlessly and we didn’t know if we would even survive until the next day. That is what largely made if feel like the war started just yesterday, as basically half of it felt like one never-ending day, and then the last 6 months felt almost normal with not much happening. If not for the occasional missile strike and the destruction you see everywhere around, you would think that no war is happening right now (that’s simplifying it quite a bit, but you get my point). 

To think that we were laughing about other people being scared of war breaking out just before the war started, thinking that it could never happen. We were thinking that the war wouldn’t happen all the way until we were literally woken up by the sound of 2 loud explosions at around 4:30am on the 24th of February. The problem with our thinking was that we were thinking rationally, and that was a big mistake, because that’s not how Russia operates.

>
>War, Poppy said, is a “dirty business, dishonest and unjust.” He has three children; two are in Kyiv, a third is in Poland. He’d like them to live in a peaceful, civilized, and democratic country. The cruel tragedy, he said, is that friends like Derekh and Greek, two young men, vital and creative, in the prime of their lives, had to fight and die for what should be a given. “These guys were simply excellent, full of positivity,” he said. “They should have returned home and kept on making life better for everyone around them.” When he’s at the front, Poppy tries to avoid such thoughts. “Anguish, grief—even anger—somehow they get in the way,” he said. I left as the sun was low in the sky, casting a spectral light over the snowy fields. Before I drove off, Poppy pulled a patch from his uniform and handed it to me. It read “Born to be free.”

Part 1 of 2

Great People of Great Ukraine!  
  
A year ago, on this day, from this very place, at about seven in the morning, I addressed you with a short statement. It lasted only 67 seconds. It contained the two most important things, then and now. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we are strong. We are ready for anything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine!  
  
That is how February 24, 2022 began. The longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven't fallen asleep since.  
  
Some people were afraid, some were shocked, some did not know what to say, but everyone felt what to do. There were traffic jams on the roads, but many people were going to get weapons. Queues were forming. Some people stood at the borders, but many went to military registration and enlistment offices, and territorial defense units.  
  
We did not raise the white flag, and began to defend the blue and yellow. We were not afraid, we did not break down, we did not surrender. The symbol of this was the border guards of Zmiinyi Island and the route they told the Russian warship.  
  
Our faith has grown stronger. Our morale has been reinforced. We endured the first day of a full-scale war. We didn't know what would happen tomorrow, but we realized for sure: every tomorrow is worth fighting for!  
  
And we fought. And we fiercely fought for every day. And we endured the second day. And then - the third. Three days that we were predicted to last. They threatened that in 72 hours we would not exist. But we survived the fourth day. And then the fifth. And today we have been standing for exactly one year. And we still know: every tomorrow is worth fighting for!  
  
I am grateful to all those who make our resistance possible. These are all our defenders. The Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ground Forces, our infantry and tank-men. Air and Naval Forces. Artillery, air defense, paratroopers, intelligence, border guards. The Special Operations Forces, the Security Service, the National Guard, the police, the territorial defense units - all our security and defense forces. Thanks to you, Ukraine stands. And we endured the furious month and the furious beginning of the war.  
  
And then came spring. New attacks, new wounds, new pain. Everyone saw the true nature of our enemy. The shelling of the maternity hospital, the drama theater in Mariupol, Mykolaiv Regional State Administration, Svobody Square in Kharkiv, the train station in Kramatorsk. We saw Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka. The whole world clearly realized what the Russian world really means. What Russia is capable of.  
  
At the same time, the world saw what Ukraine is capable of. These are the new heroes. Defenders of Kyiv, defenders of Azovstal. New feats performed by entire cities. Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Hostomel, Volnovakha, Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka. Hero Cities. The capitals of invincibility. New symbols. And with that, new assessments and forecasts for Ukraine.  
  
The first month of the war. And the first turning point in the war. The first changes in the world's perception of Ukraine. It did not fall in three days. It stopped the second army of the world.  
  
We took new hits every day, learned about new tragedies every day, but we endured thanks to those who gave it all they got every day. For the sake of others.  
  
These are our medics who rescue wounded soldiers on the frontline, perform surgeries under fire, deliver babies in bomb shelters, and stay on duty for days and weeks. Like our rescuers and firefighters who pull people out of the rubble and fire 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And our railroad workers who have been evacuating hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians since the beginning of the war without sleep or rest.  
  
And then there were the first offensives, the first achievements, the first liberated territories. The first and not the last Chornobaivka. Expulsion of the occupiers from the Kyiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Our Stuhna. Vilkha. Our Neptune and the sinking Moskva cruiser. The first Ramstein. And the second ever Lend-Lease.  
  
Ukraine has surprised the world. Ukraine has inspired the world. Ukraine has united the world. There are thousands of words to prove it, but a few will suffice. HIMARS, Patriot, Abrams, IRIS-T, Challenger, NASAMS, Leopard.  
  
I thank all of our partners, allies and friends who have stood side by side with us throughout the year. I am glad that the international anti-Putin coalition has grown so much that it requires a separate address. I will deliver it shortly. Definitely.  
  
I also thank our foreign policy army. Divisions of our diplomats, ambassadors, representatives in international organizations and institutions. All those who are fighting the occupiers with fire and sword of international law, achieving new sanctions and recognition of the terrorist state as a terrorist state.  
  
The war changed the fate of many families. It rewrote the history of our families. It changed our customs and traditions. Grandfathers used to tell their grandchildren how they beat the Nazis. Now grandchildren tell their grandfathers how they beat the Rashists. Mothers and grandmothers used to knit scarves, now they weave camouflage nets. Children used to ask Santa for smartphones and gadgets, but now they give pocket money and raise money for our soldiers.  
  
In fact, every Ukrainian has lost someone in the past year. A father, a son, a brother, a mother, a daughter, a sister. A loved one. A close friend, colleague, neighbor, acquaintance. My condolences.  
  
Almost everyone has at least one contact in their phone who will never pick up the phone again. Will never answer a text message ""How are you?"". These simple words have acquired a new meaning during the year of war. Every day, millions of Ukrainians have written or spoken this question to their loved ones millions of times. Every day, someone did not receive an answer. Every day, the occupiers killed our relatives and friends.  
  
We will not erase their names from the phone or from our own memory. We will never forget them. We will never forgive that. We will never rest until the Russian murderers face deserved punishment. The punishment of the International Tribunal. The judgment of God. Of our warriors. Or all of them together.  
  
The verdict is obvious. 9 years ago, the neighbor became an aggressor. A year ago, the aggressor became an executioner, looter and terrorist. We have no doubt that they will be held accountable. We have no doubt that we will win.  
  
In the summer we felt it. We passed 100 days of war. We received EU candidate status, returned Zmiinyi Island, heard the first ""Bavovna"" in Crimea, saw fireworks at the occupier's warehouses and Antonivskyi Bridge.  
  
August was the first month when the occupiers did not take a single Ukrainian city. Threats and ultimata about denazification were replaced by gestures of goodwill. And we felt then that our victory was inevitable. It is close. It will come.",False,1677256574.0,t3_11aiqnv,t3_11aiqnv,,0,63,0,63,0,0,

>Ukrainian forces on the battlefield also witnessed Russians downing Moscow's own helicopters and planes, according to Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who spoke to the outlet.

If the Ukrainians reach the Azov Sea, so that their strike aircraft can get over the ocean, then the Kerch Straight is indefensible from either missile or fixed wing air strike under the current operational constraints of the Russian Federation, here's why:

LOS radar has a fundemental problem when defending a position at sea. You can't look down. Everything is on the same plane. At sea level the horizon is normally only 8 miles away.

The only way to protect targets at sea from any kind of aerial strike is with an air superiority CAP that can look down on the ocean, or naval assets that can bring their AA resources to sea.

Here's an article in Slate about the formula for calculating distance to the horizon by elevation.

[https://slate.com/technology/2009/01/how-far-away-is-the-horizon.html](https://slate.com/technology/2009/01/how-far-away-is-the-horizon.html)

At 100 meters elevation the Horizon is 21 miles away.

The Sea of Azov is an oval that's 110 miles on one axis, and 220 miles on the other axis.

Sub sonic attack aircraft like A10s and Harriers would get on target without being picked up on radar across the Azov if the Russians can't fly CAP or put ships in the Sea.

A sub sonic approach at 600 miles per hour would likely only be visible on the most optimal radar setup for 4 minutes. 2 minutes on the approach from the horizon, and 2 minutes on the retreat to the horizon after the attack. Assuming the attackers have zero electronic warfare countermeasures.  (This also assumes you have to actually overfly the target for a gravity bomb attack.)",1677271604.0,1677271325.0,t3_11aiqnv,t3_11aiqnv,,0,38,0,38,0,0,

Why do you say this, you ask? It is because on Venus, a rotation of that planet, a ""day"", is 243 of our Earth days long. A Venusian hour, then, would be just little longer than 20 of our Earth-dwelling human days. 

So, by this reckoning, Putin is only about 5 Venusian hours into the *second* day of his three-day operation, and everything is therefore going to plan. *(taps forehead)* 

Ok, maybe the advance has come to a standstill and his army of alien monsters is working out to be far less terrifying than expected, but these things can be overlooked as mere translation errors from the hellishly complicated Venusian tongue. And hellish is spot on, by the way, as the temperature on Venus is some 450°C and the atmosphere is made of acid. Yea. Pretty rough for them, but hey, life sucks, right? Ask any Russian! And you thought the pollution in *your* town was bad! No wonder stuff keeps catching on fire over there!

One last note about this little theory is that it does a very good job of explaining the mysterious supply chain issues Russia seems to be having, as Venus is right now about 200,000,000 kilometers away and traffic is terrible. You would think they might choose to invade when the planets are a little closer together, but you know the old saying: [""We're very lucky they're so fucking stupid""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QuGNa3osg4).

It contains excerpts from Russian state TV. The commentators are some of the most influential in Russia and include the head of RT. They frequently call for major western capitals to be nuked and for Ukraine to be obliterated and wiped from the map. Many other  atrocities are suggested including rounding up Ukrainian children and burning them to death. 

In addition, these talking heads voice the official Kremlin line that Russia is fighting a holy war against a collective west led by drug addicted satanists headed by the antichrist himself, AKA Valensky, and it is Russia's mission to save us all from this evil.  If you haven't seen this channel, have a look to get an insight to how the Kremlin portrays us to the average Russian.

Absurd as these rants are, interviews with random Russians on other social media channels confirm that the ideas presented in them are taking root.  

I haven't seen much reporting on this aspect of the conflict. Comment?

Edit: A comment has prompted me to put in some clarification in case there's a misunderstanding.

The channel is not promoting the views of the presenters at all. Quite the opposite. It's there to highlight the disinformation war waged by the Russian state on its population. It is not promoting that disinformation.

I think that Ukrainian troops are probably being trained on mock-ups of actual sections of real front on the best ways of defeating them. I think that some very realistic war-games are being played right now, not only for the benefit of training the troops, but also for the purposes of developing the strategies that they will use. 



This is a new kind of war, and it’s constantly changing. A lot of what we knew before doesn’t apply any more. A book from 10 years ago on how to win a battle is ancient history. A book from last year is out of date.

“It is tempting to see Ukraine’s stunning successes against Russia’s aggression as a sign that with sufficient American and European help, Ukraine is close to pushing Russia back to its positions before the invasion. But that is a dangerous assumption.

A decisive military victory for Ukraine over Russia, in which Ukraine regains all the territory Russia has seized since 2014, is not a realistic goal. Though Russia’s planning and fighting have been surprisingly sloppy, Russia remains too strong, and Mr. Putin has invested too much personal prestige in the invasion to back down.”

The US followed with their own announcement of M2 Bradley, and much further in the future, Abrams. Following this, other European governments have made piecemeal announcements for the training and delivery of Leopard tanks which continues today.

All this has come nearly a year into Russias broader invasion of Ukraine. The delayed and disorganized response to supplying these critical weapons systems has in my opinion limited Ukraine’s ability to carry out offensive actions, potentially lengthening the conflict. 

Why have western powers only recently begun seriously evaluating the type and quantity of armor that could be supplied to Ukraine? Why were these preparations not undertaken much earlier in the conflict, which could have allowed for earlier troop training and weapon delivery?

From the outside we’ve been told one of Putin’s key goals domestically has been to keep the people of Moscow, and to a lesser degree other major cities like Saint Petersburg, sheltered from the effects of the conflict. We’ve seen this take shape in the propaganda spaces, the minimization of mobilization from these places, and the shut down of any discernible public dissent. Others have asked generally or about the rural population, but my question is if the Urban population is as sheltered as we’ve been told? Are they really uninformed and as non caring as has been presented? Do they not feel the effects of the war and sanctions at all? Is it all just fear? Maybe it’s just my American bias, but in my experience people in the city aren’t nearly as blindly patriotic.

I'd followed the invasion back in 2014 very closely and kept up somewhat on the conflict over the years. I've been into geopolitics and history since I was young, so I knew how important this situation was.

 I knew that Russia would eventually try to take all of Ukraine, but I wasn't sure if this was actually it or if it was just more saber rattling. Then the u.s government said that Russia would invade and i knew it was now more likely than not given I know the u.s government does not make statements like that lightly. 

Best case in my mind was that Russia would see the political opportunity of making America look alarmist as worth postponing the invasion, but I still thought the invasion would occur. I went to bed that night around nine pm EST, hoping I would not see news of a Russian invasion in the morning. My hopes were unfortunately dashed.

One thing did go right though, see, one of my best friends is a Russian expat who left the country due to her being a sexual minority. She, like myself, is also way to into geopolitics and history for her own good, and given her being Russian, had a far more thorough understanding of the inner workings of Russia than myself. 

Basically, she showed me just how much of an absolute shit show Russia was and how it could never ever fight an actual war on anywhere near the level it claimed it could. I believe she once referred to it all as ""a paper tiger if the paper had never been folded into the shape of a tiger and was on fire"" and as ""a country more corrupt than china, with a lower GDP than Florida, with more alcoholics than sober people, with a leader who sees himself as Peter the Great but is actually Nicolas II, that relies on revenue from oil sales almost as much as the saudis, that also just so happens to have nukes and enough left over gear from the 70's and 80's to be a threat"". My favorite though was her comparing Russia to ""a drunkin brown bear with a rusty AK. Sure, it's big, dumb, drunk, and lacks thumbs, but it's still a fucking brown bear with an AK"". If it's not obvious, she has little good to say of her homeland.

Based off her analysis, I became extremely sceptical of the media portraying Russia as this unstoppable killing machine and had hope that Ukraine could hold in a fight, and at worst, put up a successful insurgency if it was occupied.

My friend turned out to be right, even more so than even she realized, and god damn was I more than happy to tell her so. After three days, I knew Ukraine would win eventually, and I've been here eagerly awaiting that day ever since.",False,1677222709.0,t3_11aiqnv,t1_j9sdn3q,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

I had previously predicted that because russia had all the TECHNOLOGICAL capabilities the US used to steamroll Iraq (counter-radar munitions and such), that the same pattern would evolve. I am so happy to be wrong!

And then I watched alongside the world, here in this very subreddit, as Ukraine engaged in a desperate but masterful defensive plan that took advantage of their knowledge of russian tactics, and the sheer idiocy of their actions (like blowing up the Ukrainian cell phone towers, which made their own encrypted radios nonfunctional).

It has been an experience, all these highs and lows this last year. I can't do much to support Ukraine beyond writing posts here, but what little I can do is being done.

You had France stand up and volunteer to lead a battle group in Romania. Seeing this groundswell of support was such an incredible moment, because we had had so many consultations with allies where they were still trying to absorb, What did this intelligence really mean? Would this really happen? The fact that they were prepared to stand up and take action, even in advance of the invasion, was this tremendous moment of encouragement.

That's kinda sad.

It's also very illuminating about what we might have to do to prevent China from starting a war with Taiwan.

What are we going to do over the next 200 years to prevent nations from becoming like what Russia has become?

We can't keep doing this every 50 years until one time it results in nuclear armageddon.

From the blurb:  
>How will the war in Ukraine impact future generations? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson learns about disaster relief and helping children on the front lines with co-founder of Ukraine Children’s Action Project and pediatrician, Irwin Redlener.

More blurb:  
>What is the reality of war from a doctor's persepctive? Irwin tells us what it is like to be in a warzone and his experiences working with displaced children. We discuss the current state of humanitarian aid. Is there more we can be doing to help victims of war beyond satisfying immediate needs? What needs to happen to fully recover and build back after this conflict?

>What happens to a childs education in a time of war? We learn about Irwin’s efforts to keep Ukrainian kids in school and to continue to think about their future development. What is technology’s role in all this? We explore the playbook for addressing future conflicts and disasters and the importance of asking a kid what they want to be when they grow up.

>How do we make sure there isn’t an entire generation lost to trauma? Do we have any insights from past wars? Learn about mental health care for war refugees and how teachers are being trained to handle traumatized children.

Mariupol has had at least two periods of attacks everyday, beginning on the 21st.  Today and yesterday, absolutely no air defense was heard and it’s believed that means air defense was successfully eliminated.  Instead, yesterday and today, Fighter jets are heard scrambled.

The airport area was hit on the 21 and 23.  The seaport, too.  Those both had ammo depots.  On the 21st and 22nd, “launches” were heard in Mariupol, but not afterwards.

More importantly, explosions have occurred in the Ilych area, the Kalmius district, during *every* attack.  Although at different places around that area.  One of the places hit was the a penitentiary there.  It’s believed that was being used at barracks, but also that air defense was there.  And artillery systems and various machine repairs.

But that was a video from 2014... now the RUB is at 76... But when you look at each individual episode, the RUB has been getting stronger...

There are even shows or speakers who ridicule guys like Solovyov and Medevdev on state TV without repercussions. Some would even consider guys like Maxim Kats as either implicit or outright ""controlled opposition propaganda"", offering a very watered-down form of dissenting opinions.

The fact is, propaganda in Russia isn't designed to convince or persuade. It's designed to be so chaotic, exhausting, contradictory, and never-ending that people lose any sense of what truth even means, and mostly encourages people to proverbially stuff their fingers in their ears to make the constant white noise stop. 

Of course there will be subsets of the population who have the emotional and mental energy to sustain a constant sense of anger and interest in the ever-changing news. These people are so intellectually deficient or suppressed that it doesn't jar them in the slightest to hear that X is true on one day, and X is a dangerous western lie the next day. Some people, like one user who replied to you, enjoy this believe that the whole Russian population is like this, due to some form of fetal alcohol syndrome.

So it's not like it's some territory just occupied by Russia that houses regular Moldovans. You'd have to assume that if Moldova got back control of the area their status could change and possibly for the worse.

I'd assume they'd be loyal and pro-Russia as long as they think they'll keep their position and I don't think they have much faith that a future without Russia would be good for them.

But in the same way Moldova isn't exactly happy to be dominated by that region where they are caught in a frozen conflict and with clear signs Russia might come back and annex Moldova or at least Transnistria. And being 90% dependent on Transnistria for energy influences your country quite a bit and Russia is pretty famous for using energy as weapon of political influence so I doubt Moldova would cede it easily.

At the moment, the mood in Moscow is certainly subdued. There are millions of people across the country who oppose the war but are afraid to say it — thousands of people have been prosecuted for speaking out against the war in the last year.   
One thing to keep in mind is that contrary to some expectations, Putin has kept Russia’s borders open all year — even after he declared his draft in September. As a result, hundreds of thousands of those Russians most opposed to the war — or most unwilling to fight — have left the country. These are people who might have otherwise protested had they stayed, and that is one of the reasons we haven’t seen a large-scale uprising against Putin and might not see one for a long time. (Another reason is that Western sanctions have failed to collapse Russia’s economy or to precipitate a drastic decline in living standards.)  
But! Russia is an unpredictable place. We’ve seen mass protest movements come out of nowhere — as in the Far East city of Khabarovsk in 2020, for instance. So you can’t rule out the situation changing very fast, especially if Russia suffers dramatic setbacks at the front or Putin launches another large-scale call-up.",False,1677262765.0,t3_11aiqnv,t1_j9ttlyi,,2,15,0,15,0,0,

We realize that millions of people have been looking to the Times in the last year to try to understand the war, and we do our best to live up to that responsibility.A couple of specific lessons I’ve learned as Moscow bureau chief:

\- Prepare for every scenario, no matter how far-fetched it may seem. In late 2021, as the US was warning of a looming invasion, very few in Moscow thought it could really happen. But we started making plans at that point for how we would cover the war, and those preparations proved critical when it began on Feb. 24, 2022.

\- Building a broad network of contacts is really important for a foreign correspondent. Like many other Western news organizations, we decided to temporarily leave Russia after the government passed a wartime censorship law in March, so much of our coverage of Russia has been done from outside the country. Having spent the prior years traveling extensively across Russia and getting to know experts, officials, activists, business owners and many others helped me keep my finger on the pulse of the country from afar.

As for impartiality: indeed, our independence as a news organization is crucial to who we are as The New York Times. We go into every story with an open mind and work to talk to people on all sides of any conflict.

The issue here is still one of bandwidth. Have a person have to use a remote to fly the drone limits you to a single platform acquiring a target at a time. More controllers solved that, but it also takes more manpower. I think you do need a ""drone gun"" to launch them, but the targeting needs to be autonomous.

You set a GPS perimeter and assume everything inside that area is a ""kill zone"". Think of the drones like artillery shells at this point - once launched they will hit something. The drones would have no connection back to the operator after launch (preventing some forms of jamming as well). They arrive and once in the perimeter they loiter until acquiring a target - most likely via thermal imaging. You could also set the drones up with their own semi local network to speak to one another. When a target is acquired by one, it paints it to get direct GPS coordinates which excludes it from the other drones' potential targets. The drones then fly into their targets. For anti-personnel they'd be quite small as they only need to accommodate something the weight of a grenade, a low weight body, battery and some PCBs.

Downsides for this would be inability to use in populated areas for obvious reasons. But for the type of fighting Ukraine is engaging in now... A bunch of drones like that and the war would be over.",False,1677286849.0,t3_11aiqnv,t1_j9w3ehs,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

The question I was really asking might have been better phrased as ""why aren't gun nuts advocating the US just give nukes to Ukraine?"" The intent of my comment was 2 fold. 1, to compare guns in America to nukes in the world, especially given that nukes really are a deterrent to invasion as evidenced by Iran and North Korea and 2, to ask which treaties or schools of thought are so established on this matter that it's not even something you can ask about without being down voted to hell. Clearly we all know it's a bad idea, even though we have evidence it would totally work. So what exactly prevents it from being considered. 

The obvious answer is how it could go wrong. Ukraine could get a wild hair up it's ass and Nuke Canada with a US nuke. But it could do something similar with the billions of military aid the US has given them. So far they are only defending themselves from Russia.

So there must be some other pre-agreed concept that everyone has to rule this out as an option.

It could simply be that Russia would see that as an act of war. Or it could be some treaty.

It's utterly disgusting that Putin has been allowed to get away with annexing land and murdering people even in other countries using chemical weapons and radioactive poisoning.  

If the world had collectively stood together and stopped him the very first time this war may not have happened now. But no, he was basically given a mild slap on the wrist and told to please not be such a naughty boy.  

I know that some politicians claimed that they wanted to include Putin in various things in the hope of changing him. I think that is either incredibly naive and/or incredibly arrogant.  

To me, what I saw was businesses and countries wanting to do business with Russia. They wanted Russia's resources and money. It's no secret that Russia is an incredibly corrupt country. It's been described as a mafia state. Yet those businesses and people still wanted to work within such a system.  

I cannot help but think that the world leaders thinking they could rehabilitate Putin was more of an excuse. They didn't want to rock the boat and interfere with the business deals regarding the resources and money.  

Even when people tried sounding the alarm about what was happening they were ignored or told no investigations would be made.  

Russia exploited peoples greed. It's as simple as that.  

If that were not bad enough, world leaders and businesses have actually boosted Putin's reputation in Russia. They legitimised him by treating him as an equal and inviting him to speak at events and allowing him to spread his propaganda.

Nobody rational is looking at this conflict as a Communism vs Democracy issue.

It's an authoritarian regime ignoring the 1991 treaty where they (Russia) and their newly-independent neighbour (Ukraine) accepted the definition of Ukraine's borders, and in doing so, invaded and attempted to annex their neighbour.

Russia started this in 2014 when they decided to annex Crimea.  This is a continuation of that conflict.

This is not the same logic as Vietnam.  ""They didn't want us there"" has no bearing on this conflict as there are no third party nations' armed forces present in Ukraine (nobody has sent combat troops to Ukraine to fight against Russia); other nations are sending military aid to their ally to help them repel the Russian invaders.  Russia might not want this to happen, but they don't get a say in the matter considering they are the aggressors in the first place.  They have no legitimate claim over any of Ukraine's territory.

All anyone *seriously* wants (except the Russian government) is for the Russian forces to leave Ukraine.  That's all it would take for this conflict to end - for Russia's forces to fuck off back home to Russia.  Russia needs to take the L and go home.

You do not need a tank in your face in order to set up the logistics for it, especially not since most of the logistical vehicles needed were already handed over by Germany weeks ago. 

>maybe they need time for their mechanics and repair shops to get familiar with the equipment 

The training time for mechanics takes six months, there are no UA mechanics trained on Leopards. Training for mechanics is currently ongoing in Germany and has only started a few weeks ago.

The only way to protect targets at sea from any kind of aerial strike is with an air superiority CAP that can look down on the ocean, or naval assets that can bring their AA resources to sea.

Here's an article in Slate about the formula for calculating distance to the horizon by elevation.

[https://slate.com/technology/2009/01/how-far-away-is-the-horizon.html](https://slate.com/technology/2009/01/how-far-away-is-the-horizon.html)

At 100 meters elevation the Horizon is 21 miles away.

The Sea of Azov is an oval that's 110 miles on one axis, and 220 miles on the other axis.

Sub sonic A10s and Harriers would get on target without being picked up on radar across the Azov if the Russians can't fly CAP or put ships in the Sea.

edit: A sub sonic approach at 600 miles per hour would likely only be visible  on the most optimal radar setup for 4 minutes.  2 minutes on the approach from the horizon, and 2 minutes on the retreat to the horizon after the attack.
