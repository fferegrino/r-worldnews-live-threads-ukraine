Day 228 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was also another quiet day, there was no shelling, and I‚Äôm pretty sure they can‚Äôt really shell us anymore, getting their artillery into range would make it an easy target, so they just stopped shelling us entirely. There were some reports of explosions around 12:40am, but we didn‚Äôt hear anything, and there was no air raid alert, so it might have been our air defense shooting down something like a small drone.

Russians are calling destruction of their precious bridge a terrorist attack now, that‚Äôs rich coming from a terrorist country, which deliberately targets civilians to terrorize us. They were literally openly saying on their main TV channels that they will target civilians so that we will get fed up with being killed and *go overthrow our government* as if that makes any sense. But of course it‚Äôs us, who are terrorists, and definitely not them.

Just yesterday they killed at least 13 people, including a child, and injured over 50 more people in Zaporizhzhia when they deliberately targeted apartment buildings. And what do you know? *Today they did it again* less than an hour ago, at 2:40 am. The fucking cowardly bastards completely destroyed yet another apartment building full of civilians. We don‚Äôt know how many casualties there are yet, but it looks bad, same as yesterday. This insufferable trash is calling us terrorists after they deliberately killed at least 43 civilians *last week alone* in Zaporizhzhia? I don‚Äôt even know what to say, this is just laughable.

It‚Äôs part of an ad campaign and not going to be easily understood unless you know the context and purpose, as I also wrote below. 

The State Duma in Russia has presented several bills trying to get PMCs under the direct control of the Russian military. Essentially outlaw private military companies, instead make them a new special forces. Their reasons are that PMCs don‚Äôt have healthcare or insurance as part of the employment benefits; that no long-term veterans benefits, backed by state, are provided; and also that mercenaries are generally frowned upon internationally and can reflect poorly on Russia, but since private, not within the parameters to control‚Äîthis has been more of an issue in Africa. 

Prigozhin, of course, is very opposed. He does interviews on this topic.
These issues are now being questioned by his guys and potential guys. So he‚Äôs basically doing an ad campaign that says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm covering your costs. Need surgery? I‚Äôll pay for it. I‚Äôll get you good as new. So good that you can hop right back into the mercenary game.‚Äù THAT is what he‚Äôs saying. THAT is how it will be heard by his men and potential men.  And can the Army provide prosthetics?  Nope.  They‚Äôd be discharged if were in Army‚Äîthey know that‚Äîunemployed and wounded.  

Further, about the sending back, he‚Äôs actually reassuring them. And although it sounds insane to us‚Äîit‚Äôs not to them‚Äîthey want to go (they‚Äôre not under contract).  What other job in Russia is giving $5000/month?  Past that, Russian vets have very few job prospects, even less in this economy, but also very meager government benefits provided.  So being permitted to return sounds great to their ears.  Finally, prosthetics are rather uncommon in Russia.  Definitely not handed out to ordinary vets‚Äîso in Russians‚Äô minds, this has been a great gift that has made them whole, fit, suitable to return. 

He ironically looks benevolent to them‚Äîremember, it‚Äôs an ad campaign to quash legislation. He‚Äôs comparing his abilities to provide his men with the Army‚Äôs ability.",1665343935.0,1665343677.0,t3_xzc08x,t3_xzc08x,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

Translation:

Recently, a girl in a dress like the flag of Russia stood on a square in my city, holding a doll in her hands as a symbol of a baby smeared with red paint like blood. Have you seen this news?

Tell the whole story?

This woman is the wife of my colleague. We fired him on September 30 because now he's in huge legal trouble. And he doesn't want us to come to work and take the guys away or for us to get in trouble.

This girl's name is Maya, and her husband's name is Roma (my colleague). He was at work and did not know that she had gone to the square. She stood there for a long time and no one took her away (riot police, police, national guards). A few hours later, they approached her, took her data and released her. And then the heat started. In the evening, OMON came to them, broke down the doors, and eventually broke them down. They shouted that they would take Roma to Ukraine since they are so brave and let him wait for the summons.

They immediately hired a good lawyer. Maya was lucky that she did not say anything and did not sign. Roma filmed every visit of the police, and when they broke down the door, he was asked under pressure to erase everything from the phone. The chief prosecutor of the city called and shouted that the state allocates so much money for advertising and for buying people ‚Äúfor Russia‚Äù, and then an ordinary girl went to the square and nothing was done to her.

My guys did not want to say anything and sign anything, then a ‚Äúfake‚Äù case was brought against Maya, allegedly she is a dangerous leader of a terrorist group and she faces a life sentence. Maya left home to avoid being killed, while Roma lives there. They come to them every day, but he does not open the door, so the police are trying in various ways to get in: either they arrange a flood in the entrance, or a fire. Tomorrow they will go to the main prosecutor's office and then they will know what will happen to their lives

Ruzzia has none of these. This is why maintance is poor and equipment are less then advertised or simply doesnt exist.

2. A clear understanding of the common goal. Every soldier and employee in the armed forces needs to understand the overarching goal of any military endeavour. Failing to do so will hamper morale.

3. Abuse and hazing to an extreme degree. It is occuring in most armed forces, but not like in the ruzzian army. In 2019 they had 51 000 incidents and 1500 of those were sexual assault.

At the moment, Ukraine is pushing East and South gradually reclaiming land and liberating villages. While this is good, there is the capability and rationale to focus on eliminating the Russian Army over liberating territory.

As ill trained as the Russian armed forces is- it‚Äôs still a force to be reckoned with just due to its mass and geographic coverage. While Ukraine is taking territory from the retreating army, it would be foolish to allow units to completely flee unscathed. 

In the strategic sense as well, it would be in Ukraine‚Äôs best interest to not only reclaim the territories but to do so while destroying the remaining Russian army, capturing equipment, and having a large POW population. This would require a change in prioritization of objectives. Currently piecemeal capture of contiguous territories allows Russian forces to continue to backpedal towards collection centers and higher headquarters. Ukraine should pursue axis‚Äô of advance that seek to cut off Russian forces, creating pockets of unreinforced and isolated units and forcing either their surrender or destruction. 

With the destruction of the Kerch Rail line, Crimea is slowly becoming isolated and the Kherson front becoming more extended. Instead of pushing directly on these objectives, Ukraine should move to capture Mariupol and the Donbas region. From here the armies of the Russian Federation are stuck on Crimea and can be forced to capitulate or assaulted in totality.

Good points, I will take this into consideration as I think about it more. How I envisioned this hypothetically, underneath a low bridge span and near to a support column, you should get a fair amount of confinement. You only need to generate a modest amount of pressure to lift such a broad, flat object. The reason I mentioned it is that while the explosions aren't as shattering the volume of hot gas produced is much higher (consuming oxygen in combustion increases the mass and volume of the explosion products), and the pressure wave is sustained much longer (though conventional HE produces a much greater pressure spike).

I don't know how heavy those spans are (nor am I a physicist or even particularly strong with math; i'm guessing i should be using kilograms force, possibly), but just tossing out some round numbers that don't sound completely unreasonable,~~ if it was e.g. 100t/100m and 10m wide, that's 1000m^2, 100kg/m^2, which works out to needing an average uplifiting force of ~0.14 PSI to offset the weight of the span.~~

edit: working with the revised suggestion, which is ~40x higher mass per length than my wild-ass-guess, keeping 10m as the road width works out accordingly to a little under 6 psi. Unconfined, that would be quite a lot just held there by the ongoing explosion. I do not know if some quantity of those devices could do it, but I still would like to make the suggestion that thermobarics could conceivably have some possible advantage in bridge-hoisting.

For every week after you have not withdrawn your forces, sanctions will be extended for 6 months. So for every month you prolong this war that you cannot win you will get 2 years of sanctions.

I don't believe Ukraine did it even if they really wished they did. I don't discard the possibility completely but here me out.

Russia did it. They've been reporting in the last few weeks about how Ukraine/NATO would do something. They literally announced on propaganda channel that more terrorist attack would happen. 

It feels like nobody is able to give a clear explanation on how the bridge collapsed while having barely any effect on the next lanes and how it burnt so much of the train. The train had been stopped exactly where there's a camera that can exactly capture the explosion from multiple angles but no angles that can clearly show the road after the explosion occurred.

It's been said that the Crimea bridge has about 20 layers of security. Incompetence would be a very weak word to explain how someone was able to transport enough explosive to make the bridge collapse and burn the train while having 0 impact on the opposite lanes. It's frankly a mystery how it happened. 

But if you believe it's a false flag, then how it exploded doesn't matter because it can be all staged. The explosion can be simple pyrotechnic that makes lots of flames and smoke. It's not meant to have destructive impact but enough to look terrible on camera. Then when the explosion is done, the footage can be conveniently stopped to prevent seeing the direct aftermath.

So if pyrotechnic isn't enough to make the bridge collapse, then you can mine the bridge to make it collapse and make it explode at the same time or after the initial footage. The train... easy, you can start the fire yourself. Have we seen any footage that looks like the train was hit with anything that look like an explosive? We know it burned but not much more than that.

Then on the next day, you can film a terrible scene of the aftermath after taking down the bridge sections and conveniently left one side for road traffic and left one side of the train road to keep train traffic going (yet miscalculation in burning the bridge could have caused more damage than expected).

Then the final point. The false flag is important because it is meant to escalate. This can be used as casus belli. My point is mainly that while it's fun to see and believable that Ukraine did it... nobody can't argue that Ukraine wanted to do it. I don't believe Ukrainian army would do it if it meant to be a big strategic win. If Ukraine did it, you'd expect more coordinated attack to weaken Crimean logistics. If it doesn't happen, I'd think it support the fact that it was a false flag. 

For all we know, Russia already has ""ready to install"" bridge section that are just waiting to get put back on the cleanly cut off sections.

With Russia very much occupied with losing in Ukraine, and the (relatively) trained and equipped Russian troops that have been keeping Putin's puppet in power in Belarus being shipped off to the front to be replaced by conscripts with little equipment and almost no training, Lukashenko knows that he's on very, very thin ice. 

Right now he's safer defying Putin (while trying really hard to look like he's mostly co-operating), because Putin can't devote a lot of resources to replacing him, but the *people of Belarus* might gleefully toss him out a window with very little provocation.

There's smaller danger from displeasing Putin than from entering the war in anything but a very token fashion. Russia will continue to use Belarus as an entry point to Ukraine and the Belarus military will continue to do as little as possible while sort of looking like they still might.

Putin also has to watch how hard he pushes Lukashenko for the same reason. Belarus not 'pulling its weight' (by Putin's reckoning) is pretty bad but Belarus turning into a second Ukraine? That would be total disaster.

Everyone is treading a fine line there. It wouldn't take much to start a new revolution. This time it would probably succeed. And if Belarussian troops enter Ukraine in a big way, Ukraine will quite likely do things to both encourage and aid such action. Their special forces are pretty decent, it wouldn't take much to tip the balance there. If the the troops that get sent to fight don't revolt at once, they would still get pulled back if trouble started in Belarus, and they might not be that keen to support the government that sent them to Ukraine.

significant for a few reasons:
- it's symbolically linked to Putin, also occuring on his birthday 
- shows vulnerability of Russian infrastructure even when heavily guarded
- happened nearly simultaneously with an attack on another rail-hub in the Donbas and at the same time the fuel train was passing shows incredible sophistication of Ukrainian operations.

**Ukrainian position**
- have the initiative
- if they attack Svatove they have larger objective of Lugansk
- if they attack Kremina they are trying to retake Sievierodonetsk/Lysychansk 
- Kherson is a grind, and that's the point, however it's very difficult/costly for Ukraine, they are losing a lot of soldiers 
- unknown if 3rd front will open in Zaporizhzhia
- successful Zaporizhzhia offensive to Melitopol would be the worst case scenario for Russia

**New Russian commander** 
- ruthless hothead but seemingly competent 
- won't be able to change anything.

**Mobilization is a hot mess.** 
- don't mistake a hot mess for incapable.
- the idea is to keep throwing men at it until the West gets tired and gives up

**Putin is a master procrastinator.** 
- trying to delay/buy time in the hopes that there will be an advantage tomorrow that didn't exist today.
- because of annexation/mobilization this conflict is tied to Putin and he can't simply declare victory and go home 
- he wants to push for a ceasefire to rearm and try again later.
- nuclear weapons aren't very useful to him because they force a quick response which does him no favors.
- if the Russian military falls too quickly then escalation is more likely because Putin sees that as a threat to his hold on power

So, let's pretend that everything and anything is on the table, even Ukraine's total surrender. Then, what's the answer? How do we make it stop? The Ukrainians have already had several peace agreements and assurances from Russia and last I checked, they weren't being honored. Why would you expect Russia to change their pattern of aggression now? If we gave Russia all the annexed regions and Zelensky's head on a platter, would that make the world a better or safer place, or would it just embolden Putin more? Would he take it as an okay to rearm and carry on into Moldova ir somewhere else? Likely.

Unfortunately, at this point, the Ukrainians are literally the best army in the world to stop the Russians and frankly,  no one but tge Ukrainians has a right to tell the Ukrainians that they have to surrender to Russian genocide. 

So, given that the Ukrainians won't, and really can't surrender, the best option seems to help them as mush as we can and hope that Russia gets such a beating that they reconsider doing this again. Otherwise, Russia will realm and try it again on a weaker foe that is not as prepared or strong willed as Ukraine.

We know that the morale is shattered and that communications and battlefield awareness is simply not there for the Russians. But this is not the most likely scenario where the army gets cut off at the unit level.

At the operational and strategic level is where I most advocate a principle of cutting off the Russian army. Slowly advancing forward will allow the units of Svatove and Mariupol to retreat eastward to bases back in Rostov and Krasnodar Krai Russia. What I am advocating is to focus on enveloping those units and prevent their retreat at all cost. By destroying the army you can come back to towns and liberate them anyways.

Both China and India have likely given very specific consequences to Russia in private, regarding the use of such nukes.

Will Putin's command structure accept a command to use a tactical nuclear device, or will giving such an order lead to his ouster? Already his positioned is severely weakened. Putin himself must also have his doubts on this, which may prevent him from giving such an order to begin with.

It also does not address the fact that if NATO allows itself to be allowed to be blackmailed like this, it only opens the door to future blackmailing by Russia and other nuclear nations. Therefore, NATO has every interest to _not_ allow this no matter what. Now that may seem like an argument *for* escalation happening, but Russia **also** knows this. They say boldly that NATO will do nothing, but they know in practice NATO only stands to lose if they do not lock the door now.

When looking at the escalation dynamics, he mentions that if the US takes out Russia's black sea fleet, that Russia might strike back, and then that leads to escalation. But clearly, the US has zero reason to continue escalating with Russia in such a scenario. They would take out their Ukrainian assets and Black Sea fleet, and then probably stop reacting to any kind of reprisal Russia might undertake, with the exception on any type of strikes on USA mainland proper - depending on their result. So it's not remotely as simple as he is painting it to be.

I also have real issues with the percentages he names. They are, as you say, pulled out of a hat, but he does not acknowledge that. He seriously works with them as if they have any value. That really undermines his credibility.

 >The Zone Rouge (English: Red Zone) is a chain of non-contiguous areas throughout northeastern France that the French government isolated after the First World War. The land, which originally covered more than 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), was deemed too physically and environmentally damaged by conflict for human habitation. Rather than attempt to immediately clean up the former battlefields, the land was allowed to return to nature. Restrictions within the Zone Rouge still exist today, although the control areas have been greatly reduced.

Again, ideally you could surround and wipe them out/capture them completely.  But the risk is probably too high and IMO could really be counterproductive.  Heavy casualties and loss of equipment will sap Ukraine's offensive capability (just like it did to Russia earlier in the year) and so they may wipe out one set of Russian forces, but then be much more limited offensively for a quite a while.  I think it's better to keep your offensive ability intact, keep driving Russia back and inflict on them moderate losses of men and high losses of equipment.

And then there is the simple practical reality: they don't have the kind of offensive mobility and firepower to truly make rapid advances against areas that Russia has adequately manned and equipped, like in the south.  So it's all a relatively slow slog whether or not you'd like to go fast or not.

This is why every single one of you must vote if you can. I cannot stress this enough. The United States is perilously close to being dismantled. Our democracy is hanging by a thread. First they are going to undermine elections. Next they will make it impossible to vote. They will remove the voting rights act, legalize gerrymandering, and sending alternate electors to DC. 

You and everyone you know must vote straight Democrat, for every single position. Even if someone is running for water commissioner. Or garbage man. All the way up to Commander in Chief. No they aren‚Äôt perfect. But right now it‚Äôs the only way to stop the United States from falling into a fake democracy. 

Vote vote vote. And if you are fucking someone who voted for Republicans. Stop fucking them. Break up with them. Divorce them. Make them understand how serious this is and that voting for fascists has repercussions.

Never touch Republican genitalia.

 >Millennium Challenge 2002 (MC02) was a major war game exercise conducted by the United States Armed Forces in mid-2002. The exercise, which ran from 24 July to 15 August and cost US$250 million (equivalent to about $377M in 2021), involved both live exercises and computer simulations. MC02 was meant to be a test of future military ""transformation""‚Äîa transition toward new technologies that enable network-centric warfare and provide more effective command and control of current and future weaponry and tactics. The simulated combatants were the United States, referred to as ""Blue"", and a fictitious state in the Persian Gulf, ""Red"", often characterized as Iran or Iraq.

You clearly haven't been paying attention to the previous ""negotiations"". Putin has used every attempt to be insulting. It's better to freeze him out and continue the push. Additionally by NOT negotiating with Putin, Ukraine is sewing discord in the Kremlin - there is a VERY good chance Putin could be forcibly removed by the oligarchs that CARE very much about protecting their interests/money. No good will come of going right back to the negotiation table so quickly when Ukraine is winning. Putin played the ""negotiation"" card already to attempt to garner diplomatic support, as before he was trying to buy time to refortify.

Our technology is so inadequate to study space that it's ridiculous to make statements like yours with such conviction.

At the end of the day, if you think the future of space exploration is Star Trek/ Star Wars, you haven't paid attention and have no idea of the limits of our universe and what it affords us in regards to becoming an interplanetary species.

Sure, we might be able to build a habitat on the moon, maybe even on Mars. But that won't make us interplanetary.

And likely, if other civilizations exist out there, they are facing the same issues.

Maybe out galaxy is barren, and other galaxies far far away are ripe with alien civilizations, who the hell knows? Certainly not a formula that is based on no verifiable data or information, but purely speculation.

The Fermi Paradox is science fiction.

There is no data it is based upon because the data is made up. It has some random inputs that the creator of the formula dreamed.

What makes him an authority on the matter, I have no idea, apparently ""he wrote it"" is enough.

His variables make no sense, and I could write a similar formula tonight and you couldn't disprove it because ""observable data.""

How ""observable data"" means anything here, I don't know.

We can observe billions of stars, yet we can't study billions of stars. In fact, we barely managed to study a tiny tiny part of the data we observed.

Observed data is not studied data.

I understand you think you are an authority among your friends that smoke pot, but please make an effort to understand the science fiction you praise.

From Wikipedia:

>The Fermi paradox is the conflict between the lack of clear, obvious evidence for extraterrestrial life and various high estimates for their existence.[1][2] As a 2015 article put it, ""If life is so easy, someone from somewhere must have come calling by now.""[3] 

A lack of obvious evidence doesn't mean the evidence is not there, it means we are too stupid to understand the data we have. Or that we can't even capture the data we need to make this determination.

As for the ridiculousness of ""someone would have come calling by now"" I have no words other than other science fiction fans like yourself consider themselves authorities on the matter.

How would they come here? The universe is decisively against anyone being able to travel vast amounts of space and time and survive.

What if they can't detect us like we can't detect them?

What if they are far enough that detection is impossible? Like in another galaxy?
