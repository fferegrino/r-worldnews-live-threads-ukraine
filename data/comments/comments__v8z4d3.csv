Day 107 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was relatively quiet today, but we still got shelled a couple times. Once around noon, though it wasn’t too close to us, so we barely heard it here, they were mostly shelling settlements in the Kharkiv oblast today. Then at exactly midnight there were at least 3 big explosions, most likely from missiles, the building was shaking pretty badly, but it quickly quieted down. 

The timing is right, we heard explosions just as we got confirmation of missiles being launched from Belgorod yet again, they fire those missiles every day now, and during the exact same timeframe. Don’t know what was hit, but I don’t think any fires started this time. Those missile strikes are so pointless and yet they still continue doing them, destroying schools and supermarkets while calling them tank factories.

And then Putin just goes and drops the original goal of his “special operation.” Why are they so inconsistent with their war goals? First they wanted denazification, but now Putin doesn’t care about some Nazis anymore, now it’s about reclaiming the “Russian lands.” While it’s obvious that Russians are living in the past, I thought it was just the recent past, but apparently they are living in the 18th century.",False,1654913833.0,t3_v8z4d3,t3_v8z4d3,,0,79,0,79,1,0,

Finland’s government plans to amend border legislation to allow the building of barriers on its eastern frontier with Russia, it has said, in a move to strengthen preparedness against hybrid threats amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Finland, which is currently applying for membership in the Western military alliance NATO, has a history of wars with Russia, although currently the forest-covered border zone between the two countries is marked merely with signs and plastic lines for most of its 1,300km (808 miles) length.

The Finnish government has rushed to strengthen border security as it fears Russia could attempt to put pressure on Finland by sending asylum seekers to its borders – as the European Union accused Belarus of doing at the end of last year when hundreds of migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa got stuck at the Polish border.

Under existing EU rules, migrants have the right to ask for asylum at any given entry point to an EU member country. The amendments would also allow the building of barriers, such as fences, as well as new roads to facilitate border patrolling on the Finnish side

The US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has described the Russian-occupied region of Kherson as the “Kremlin’s laboratory of horrors”.

Russia’s pre-planned and multi-faceted campaign to absorb Kherson into Russia and install puppet authorities “lays bare the truth of its vision of a subjugated, Russified Ukraine”, Michael Carpenter said in a speech to the OSCE council in Vienna on Thursday.

“Kherson is the Kremlin’s laboratory of horrors.  Every day Kherson remains under Russia’s control, the Kremlin works to further its plan to replace Kherson’s democratic government, free press and civil society with a Kremlin-style police state that humiliates and brutalises the local population, abuses their human rights, and abducts, tortures, and/or kills those the Kremlin deems dispensable,” Carpenter said.

He said Moscow had tried to recruit local political figures and activists using coercion and blackmail that sometimes included unlawful imprisonment, and threats of kidnappings of relatives. Meanwhile, citizens were cut off from internet access which kept them from reliable information and Ukrainian government services

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, who made an unannounced visit to Kyiv this week, agreed to work “even more closely” with Ukraine during meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.

“The three agreed to work even more closely going forward in support of their shared goal of enabling Ukraine to liberate itself from illegal Russian occupation,” according to a UK Ministry of Defence press release. “They also discussed the range of equipment and training the UK is currently providing and what further support we can offer to help Ukrainian forces to defend their country.”

It is unclear when the meeting took place. The defense ministry said that the two-day trip took place “this week,” and Zelensky posted video of the meeting on his official Telegram channel on Friday afternoon.

Zelensky told Wallace during the meeting that “war is a great manifestation of who our true friends are,” and that the UK had proven itself to be one.

“I am very grateful for such a truly united work. These words are constantly moving into action, and this is a very important difference between Ukraine's relations with the UK and other countries,” Zelensky said. “Weapons, finances, sanctions are three things in which the United Kingdom has consistently shown its leadership.”

Things like the idea that Crimea voted in a legitimate referendum or the Donbas republics seceded without direct intervention from Russia driving their secession.

The most egregious one is probably Syria though. The whole civil war started because Assad, a pro-Russian dictator and one of the most authoritarian leaders in the modern world, massacred peaceful protesters a la Tiananmen Square, who subsequently rose up to fight back. Just when it looked like he might lose, Russia intervenes on his side, carpet-bombing cities, while he tortures hundreds of thousands of people to death and uses chemical weapons on civilians. Yet somehow Russia convinced people that they were the good guys and it was the west that destroyed Syria, even though (while estimates vary), the pro-Russian Assad government killed 100,000-200,000 civilians, Russia killed 6000-8000, ISIS killed about 5000 and the west 2-3000. Russia and their proxy literally caused 90-95% of the civilian deaths in Syria but they have the gall to call it a western thing, and some useful idiots in the west just accept it! Russia literally killed more Syrians than ISIS, and their ally killed 10 times more even than that. How often have you seen people referring to Syria as a country the west destroyed, or even denying that Assad used chemical weapons.

One thing I'm really happy to see is that, in the west at least, Putin's attempts to rewrite history and convince millions of westerners that he's in the right have failed, with only extreme political fringes going along with that narrative.

From CNN's Julia Presniakova, Olga Voitovych, and Mick Krever

Intense fighting is ongoing for control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, with no major changes reported in the past day, according to Ukrainian officials.

“The situation in Severodonetsk is very tense,” Roman Vlasenko, head of the Severodonetsk district military administration, told Ukrainian national television.

“Fighting continues, street fighting continues. The dynamics are very great. The Russians are heavily using artillery. They have a certain advantage in terms of artillery, in terms of personnel. But they have no real success. They can't beat the guys out of Severodonetsk.”

Vlasenko said that the Ukrainian military in Severodonetsk was “confident” in their defense.

On Wednesday, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration, Serhiy Hayday, said most of the city was now controlled by Russian forces, although Ukrainians had retained control of Severodonetsk's industrial zone.

Hayday told Ukrainian television Friday that those fighting for Severodonetsk faced difficulty, “but they clearly understand that they are not threatened by encirclement.

“They clearly hold their positions and understand how things are developing,” he said.

In an address on Thursday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said ""Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on.""",False,1654866657.0,t3_v8z4d3,t3_v8z4d3,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Cholera and other deadly diseases could kill thousands of people in Mariupol as corpses lie uncollected and summer brings warmer weather, its mayor has warned.

Vadym Boichenko said wells had been contaminated by the corpses of people killed during weeks of Russian bombardment, and that the collection of bodies by the city’s Russian occupiers was proceeding slowly.

“There is an outbreak of dysentery and cholera. This is unfortunately the assessment of our doctors: that the war which took over 20,000 residents … unfortunately, with these infection outbreaks, will claim thousands more Mariupolites,” he told national television.

Boichenko, who is based outside Mariupol, said residents there had been forced to drink water from wells because the city had no running water or functioning sewerage system.

An interesting historical perspective here from Timothy Snyder, Levin Professor of History at Yale, on the seemingly widespread assumption that Russia is likely to triumph in the conflict on the basis it is a nuclear power.

""This is utter nonsense, and dangerous nonsense,"" he says, before going on to list a series of wars in which nuclear-armed countries have failed, citing the US campaign against North Vietnam, and the USSR's conflict with Afghanistan.

""The Cold War was a period of decolonisation, in which colonial powers lost decisive wars to anti-colonial movements or states. Russia acts today as a colonial power,"" he writes.

""In recent decades, it has more often than not been the smaller state that has defeated the larger one on the battlefield.

""Nuclear powers do lose wars; big countries often do; and imperial powers will be humiliated. Historically speaking, a Ukrainian victory over Russia would not be surprising.""

In a conclusion that would appear to be implicitly urging Western nations to provide Kyiv with more support, he says: ""If Ukraine loses this war, it might well be because others used bad history to give themselves bad reasons to waste time during the weeks that will define the decades to come.""

Igor Girkin's latest thoughts. Saying Donetsk infantry is 70% gone. Says Russians themselves have large losses, too, refuses to say how much, and says that the donbas frontline is basically at a standstill as Ukraine gathers its reserves for an attack at some point. Also says that a major counter attack by Ukrainians will probably happen soon.

edit:

Also in the comments there's a reference to two Russian generals in Kherson getting killed today, not sure about reliability but worth looking into maybe?

Algeria supports the Polisario Front there, Spain supports Moroccan claims. Algeria has been a close ally of Russia’s for a long time, and they have enormous un-tapped hydrocarbon reserves closer to Central Europe than Russian reserves with several pipelines already in place.



Resolving the conflict in Western Sahara could do a lot for transitioning away from Russian energy supplies. Polisario are not exactly a bunch of angels, but they rose up against Spanish colonial power to try to have a country of their own. I say give it to them. Sure, then we probably get a new Islamist state in the world. And sure, Morocco is one of Americas oldest allies, if not the oldest. But carving Algeria away from Russias sphere would be a game-changer. 



Russia has been a terrible friend to Algeria. Russia has never really wanted what’s best for Algerians. Their fields are mostly undeveloped because Russia knows that Algerian gas and oil would undercut Russian production costs.

I know life and war and politics and history are not “fair”, but it seems bitterly unjust to me that Russia could have seemed like it was losing a month or two ago, only to now seem to be edging towards “victory” (or at least a stalemate and possible ceasefire on terms favorable to Russia in the long term) using Zapp Brannigan tactics of sending wave after wave of conscripts forward until the Ukrainians run out of shells and bullets and hit their built-in kill limits.

See the damage done in the UK (Brexit), the States (Republican party being increasingly aligned with anti-liberal-democratic values), Hungary (fuckin' Orban), Germany (huge chunks of heavily brainwashed former GDR residents and other useful idiots polluting the waters in the left and right wing political spheres) and even France as well (Marine Le Pen).

Every dollar spent on Ukraine is dollars spent on destroying Russia's ability to wage war now - dollars we don't have to spend in the future.

If Russia comes away from this bloodied, battered and bruised, they're going to have a hard time building that military back up to threaten the international system again. That's worth every penny sent to Ukraine.

Hell, if they end up so deep in the red, they could actually cut back on the nukes in a near collapse scenario, since they know they're the only idiots crazy enough to launch nukes first.

A lot of people use the term for the lowest class of reserves, potential reserves, that are just guesses from geologists about how much hydrocarbon is in some particular undeveloped area. Then you go to tested reserves, that are guesses from petroleum engineers about how much hydrocarbon could be actually gotten out of a particular area, then there’s proven reserves that have actually had a lot of expensive test-drilling and sampling and pressure testing done on them and are a lot better than guesses. None of them are ‘production’. Production is production, how much is actually getting out of the ground in to market daily from fields that have already been developed.



I have no way of even attempting to reply  because you’re talking about reserves and production interchangeably, and the two are only very tangentially related. Vast ‘reserves’ could have virtually zero economic interest if their production costs are too high. You have to have a business-plan to exploit an undeveloped hydrocarbon field. You can’t do that until you’ve done pressure checks and test wells to know if the value of the deposits is higher than the cost of drilling for them.

Russia and their proxy literally caused 90-95% of the civilian deaths in Syria but they have the gall to call it a western thing, and some useful idiots in the west just accept it! Russia literally killed more Syrians than ISIS, and their ally killed 10 times more even than that.

Don't get me wrong, its important to know about the scale of atrocities, as well as how these weapons work (so that we know which weapons to focus on for the next war).

1. Russian tanks have a turret-toss problem. This is proven now, in case there was any doubt before.

2. Antitank weapons are clearly working vs the Russian tanks.

3. Artillery remains the king of battle, and the shelling is incredibly intense in the Donbas region.

4. Missiles (Javelins, anti-air missiles, stingers, etc. etc.) travel a lot slower than I thought they did. I can clearly see, and track with my eyes, a lot of these missile launches.

5. Drones are very good at documenting, spotting, and other such tasks.

They received 150+ pieces. M777 is likely why Ukrainians are able to form such a strong defensive position and have blunted the Russian advance. 

Self propelled guns will be another game changer if more of them flow in that is. We should now watch what comes out of the French & US visits to Kiev this week and also Finland promised more weapons this week.

\- some 20 CEZARS (France)

\- 20+ DANAs (Czech Republic)

\- 22+ M109 (Norway)

\- 18 AHS Krab (+ Ukraine bought 58 more)

\- 12 Phz 2000 SPGs (Germany + Netherlands)

\- 7 itallian SPGs forgot the name

\- 8 ZUZANA SPGs from Slovakia (bought)

It'd almost certainly go both ways now too if Russia had any real chance to move over Swiss airspace or for whatever reason wanted to move military arms through it.


You can dislike neutrality but saying this isn't Switzerland being neutral is wrong.



edit: C&P'ing the part of the article that discusses the transfer 

>A request from the Polish government was also considered. Poland is interested in disused Leopard 2 A4 type tanks of the Swiss Army. Poland justifies this request by the fact that it has delivered weapons in substantial quantities to Ukraine, including heavy means, and that it therefore now needs means to replenish its own stocks and defense capabilities.

>Given that the alienation of disused tanks to another State presupposes the decommissioning of these systems beforehand, a step subject to the approval of Parliament within the framework of messages on the army, the DDPS considers that, in the circumstances current conditions, the alienation of decommissioned tanks to Poland cannot be carried out within a reasonable period of time.

I think the biggest reason we had a big downer was that there was a period of something like 2 weeks after Russia said they'd put all focus on the Donbas offensive when nothing but pathetic probing attacks happened. People got hopeful Russia was just crippled at that point. But they picked up a slow pace but that's proven effective by relying on artillery and as you can see in the article the big thing about running out of ammo is as far as I'm aware mostly related to Soviet rockets and artillery which is the main factor now.

Is this bad? Yep. The western artillery is good and precise but they don't have enough of them. To me this is the reason why Ukraine is being so alarmist about it imo. They need more and especially they need more long range MLRS and they need it asap. They can't just sit around. If anything this should've probably been sent a long time ago you'd think.

Alright, but is there any positives? Well, Russia is still going very slow in their advances and Ukraine has had some success in smaller offensives around Kherson, Kharkiv and just recently Zaporizhzia. Ukraine has mobilized hard since the start and they have a manpower advantage vs Russia which they might exploit in the places where the artillery and heavy equipment isn't as concentrated. Also they might delay until the west has sent a critical amount of artillery + MLRS to bolster the re-taking.

So to me my TL:DR would be that it's a very serious situation but I'd say it's far from ""Ukraine fucking lost, better just give up now"" and more ""I fucking hope they can get as many MLRS as possible fast""",False,1654893230.0,t3_v8z4d3,t1_ibwa8bm,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

I don't think so.

I think Russia's strength in Severodontesk has made it obvious to the Ukrainians that the Russian's are weaker in all other parts of the country. Once this fact became obvious, the ""best move"" started to be the counter-offensive plans, even without the full set of recruits / MLRS systems that Ukraine will inevitably receive.

Might as well take some careful gains here-and-there across the front lines, while Russia is overly focused on one area.

---------

Since MLRS / HIMARS systems are confirmed, we can be somewhat certain that the Ukrainians will wait for those missiles **before** launching a major offensive. It just makes sense.

Versailles was problematic because it was simultaneously too harsh and not harsh enough.

Russia is the equivalent of finding that slight split, and sticking a fucking massive axe head in it and smashing it with a sledgehammer to try breaking the system. Make that wedge issue so large the gap can never be filled (I would argue they were successful in the US, as the gulf between right and center expands to bonkers levels). Russian defectors and former KGB agents have clearly outlined this as their MO from the Soviet era. Fuck, even the Tsarist Okhrana did this shit (they were the original authors of that anti-Semitic hit job that is the ""Chronicles of the Elders of Zion""). Russia: a bastion of reactionary conservatism since forever. Hell, it's written clear as day in Dugin's whacked out book, and Russia has held pretty obviously close to that plan, right down to using the German government's weakness on them via gas supply, Brexit, stoking racist and isolationist sentiments throughout the US etc.

Even here in NZ, there are right-wing conspiracy theorist groups, white-replacement morons (Christchurch Shooter) and even some Maori organisations here in NZ advocating way more divisive, aggressive and extreme views and getting online attention that never existed pre-2014. This is happening on both extreme ends of the political spectrum. I saw it go from 1-11 real quick in a short space of time in a country as tiny as this, and it was largely propped up and megaphoned way more than it realistically would have been without Russian bot activity.

Granted you may be correct, but there is no way that kind of stuff would've bubbled naturally in NZ without outside interference. Surprisingly, many of the OG allied nations conveniently had major right-wing anti-vax rallies attempting to disrupt our capitals and democratic processes at the same time Russia was timing their invasion back in Feb. I literally work down the road from Parliament, and boy oh boy was it obvious that *someone* was finding enough genuinely low-intelligence people and funneling them down a path to cause chaos with lie after propped up lie. A known MO of Russia in the Hybrid warfare era is to distract and misdirect international support and attention by forcing obnoxious political issues to crop up domestically to hopefully distract international attention from their fuckery. That backfired this time because they shot their load too early, but fuck knows how successful this could have been for them if they got that mongoloid called Trump reelected.

They just discounted the fact that we hold genocide (especially in Europe) in very high contempt, and the old-guard in Centrist politics in many Western countries have been looking for a chance to kick Russia down a few pegs as a short term obstacle in order to deal with the real threat in China. Mostly because that can of worms can do a shitload more damage economically with Taiwan and fucking with international trade in the region.",False,1654848161.0,t3_v8z4d3,t1_ibtsane,,3,11,0,11,0,0,

Hydrocarbons are frickin’ everywhere. The oil and gas business is a game of finding the most economical to get to market reserves, and then actually doing it. Production is an active source of income. Reserves are potentially a giant money-pit if your estimates from test drilling turn out to be wrong or if you run in to difficulties in the development phase. 



That Ukraine is still controlling most of their domestic production is great, and active production will have an amount of proven reserves attached to it.

Agreed. I'm still seeing Ukrainians on motorcycles or Toyota / Nissan trucks, so an M113 is an upgrade over that for sure. So I'm not necessarily saying that I ""don't want"" the Ukrainians getting M113, I just wish that they were getting a better vehicle.

> And the maintenance is far more simple than more modern IFVs, which was probably the biggest point.

That is a good point. If the M113 is easier to maintain, then that leads to plenty of advantages. M2 Bradley is considered a mess of a vehicle, highly effective in combat but all sorts of maintenance issues IIRC.

M113 is almost certainly easier to use. Its basically just a car. Bradley has all kinds of sophisticated systems in it. So maybe M113 was given because they're easier to learn?",False,1654896259.0,t3_v8z4d3,t1_ibwi87k,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

And sure those fractures could grow but you're leaving out all the counties that are in agreement. Also saying that France or Italy ""demanded"" Ukraine surrender is a gross exaggeration of what they said. Also Turkey just wants at least some of the arms sanctions they had put on them taken off, they'll probably get them lifted and then all the sudden Erdogan will drop his objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO. Plus he's just trying to look tough for the elections coming up and if the opposition wins they're even more likely to drop objections.

Also yes Russia is still making money from oil but sanctions have crippled some areas of their defense industry, they've lost the ability to repair or replace a lot of high tech equipment, that's going to drag on their military power going forward. And make no mistake the sanctions are really hurting in general as well.

Plus Putin seems afraid to fully mobilize within Russia which means he's trying to fight the war with the troops he's got, Wagner group mercenaries, trying to push people to volunteer and some forced conscripts from what they already occupy of the Donbass and Crimea. If they don't fully mobilize and start drafting a lot of Russians I don't see how they're going to make any major gains and instead Ukraine might well be forced back. They've been forced to withdraw from around Kyiv completely and they've lost a lot of ground around Kharkiv. And at the rate they're taking ground in the east it will be years before they take the rest of Donbass.

So anyway yes not all of Ukraine's allies are completely united in everything and it's not all roses and some people are a little too optimistic for sure but you're just biased the other way and focusing only on the negatives.

Russia has no trade partners. Europe has turned its back on Russia. It won’t come back. Russia has let down its trade partners too many times.

NATO has been rejuvenated.

What will happen now is the world will make sure that Russia will bury itself in this war in the worst possible way. It will lose all of it modern war equipment.

US/NATO style command doctrine is that generals may control the large-scale movements of where forces are... but any particular **unit** has leaders (Majors, Captains, Lieutenants) who makes the day-to-day decisions about when and where to attack.

-------

The Russians are playing this game as you say. They come up with a big plan in the Kremlin, thinking this is a chess game. Russian Army does X, Ukrainians are forced to do Y, then Russians do Z to beat them.

US/NATO and (clearly) Ukrainian forces do things differently. There are hundreds (maybe thousands) of Majors / Captains looking at the front-line, all across the front. As soon as the Russian troops started moving away, those individual Majors/Captains thought ""Hmmm, maybe its a good time to counter-attack"", and started to make those plans.

As such, when the Russian Army does X, before the Ukrainian Generals even ""decide to do Y"", individual lower-level officers (Majors / Captains / Lieutenant) are already reacting to the movement of enemy troops. As such, the Ukrainian army ""decided to do Y"" before the Russian army even finished doing X.

Nobody is asking the Swiss to supply Ukraine themselves. They're wishing to use weapons held by NATO members, that they bought from the Swiss, to supply a NATO partner in a time of defensive war.

The whole point of NATO standardisation agreements (STANAGs) was to overcome the logistics issues encountered in WW2 where every member of the Allies used different and incompatible equipment, from rifle rounds through to highly advanced combat aircraft, meaning that, like Ukraine today, replacements needed to be whole systems rather than simply components. The idea behind STANAGs is that NATO members/partners can freely exchange ammunition and materiel when in need, particularly parts and maintenance. It means NATO members can be highly specialist rather than generalist in their armed forces, and can make use of resources stockpiled by other nations if required. For example, if someone attacked French overseas islands like, say, Reunion in the Indian Ocean, France could theoretically borrow additional maritime patrol aircraft and AWACS aircraft to meet a temporary demand their own air force could not meet, and these aircraft would already be comms-compatible with their existing force, and of a type their pilots were already certified to fly because they're the same aircraft, just more of them. Likewise, if there was a problem with rogue vessels in the Baltic Sea, other nations (e.g. the UK) in NATO could send additional patrol boats or light destroyers to back up the small navies there, with or without crews, or just ship them more ammunition. There are countless examples of hypothetical scenarios but the binding point is that NATO is built around the idea that stuff ""just works"" together.

The fear here is that Switzerland is providing a barrier to that process of interchangeability and that it could threaten NATO's capabilities substantially if they were under direct attack, having to choose between using Swiss-supplied weapons now, or being guaranteed to be able to buy more later.

That's a real issue and one that needs to be addressed - as a non-member of NATO, Switzerland should not have the ability to compromise NATO's ability to wage war on bureaucratic grounds.",False,1654878373.0,t3_v8z4d3,t1_ibv1e0x,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

""Armored Brigade"" adds in command-delay. When you call for an artillery strike, it can take 4 minutes to aim the guns. When you call for air support, it can take 10 minutes for the air support to come in.

When you call for mortar attacks, it can take 1 minute to aim and fire.

Den Krieg mit ein paar Worten verurteilen weil es Krieg ist und die eigene außenpolitischen Vorstellungen überdenken sind zwei verschiedene Paar Schuhe. Bartsch, den du hier zitierst, hat vor [5 ganzen Tagen](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/interview-der-woche-dietmar-bartsch-fraktionsvorsitzender-linkspartei-sondervermoegen-ukrainekrieg-100.html) noch ein wunderschönes Interview gegebenen, in denen er den USA durch die Blume eine Mitschuld am Krieg gibt und behauptet sie würden dadurch massiv profitieren während er sich gegen Waffenlieferungen ausspricht. 1:1 das alte ""NATO provoziert Russland, die können gar nicht anders""-Narrativ. Gleichzeitig ärgert er sich übrigens auch noch, dass die Parteispitze aka Wissler auf Regierungsfähigkeit und Rot-Rot-Grün gesetzt hat, wünscht sich also die übliche Fundamental-Opposition statt demokratische Kooperation zurück.

> Eines muss man ja auch ganz klar sagen: Wenn es eine Partei gibt, die in vielerlei Hinsicht eine Siegerin in diesem Krieg ist, dann ist es wahrhaftig nicht die Ukraine. Die leidet unter diesem Angriff. Dann ist es wahrhaftig nicht Russland, wo auch die Sanktionen wirken. Da ist es wahrhaftig nicht Europa. Aber die Vereinigten Staaten haben, dadurch, dass sie jetzt ihr Gas nach Europa und auch nach Deutschland exportieren werden, dass sie in Größenordnung Rüstungsgüter nach Europa, auch nach Deutschland exportieren würden, **dass sie Europa in eine schwierige Situation gebracht haben**, sind sie interessengeleitet. 

Das was die Linke in solchen Aspekten unwählbar macht ist durchaus auch bei der breiten Masse an Führungspersonen weiterhin vertreten. Dass die jetzt gerade den Krieg verurteilen ändert offensichtlich nichts an ihren eigentlichen Positionen - in der Sekunde eines Waffenstillstands wird vermutlich mal wieder von einem ""Sicherheitssystem mit Russland [in der Führungsrolle]"" geträumt. Selbst jetzt wird ja schon wieder bei allem was gegen Russland geht von Kriegstreiberei und ""Eskalation"" geredet.

Once conquered by the DNR military, this body was found. The identity is unknown for the moment. The woman's body exhibits various forms of torture. Numerous tortures were inflicted on them. On the woman's belly - between the ages of thirty and forty - there is a ""swastika"" made through numerous cuts and evident burns. On the woman's lower side there is a compression hematoma in the shape of a boot: the detail suggests that the tortures were inflicted while the woman was alive and that there were at least two torturers. The woman's arms were tied behind her back with electrical tape: the detail is not visible in her photo, but observable from the left side of the corpse. The plastic bag and duct tape on the woman's neck suggest she was killed by suffocation. Her body was unclothed at the bottom. The uniforms covering the woman are military jackets with Ukrainian insignia found on the spot, by the DNR military, along with other weapons and equipment. **Note: At the moment I do not have other information and details on the affair available.**

> It's based on an assumption

I'm quoting am appointed official representing  the Biden administration in a hearing to the US Senat. You're gonna dismiss that as ""an assumption"" that holds no weight compared to an article from Bloomberg? 

That aside, the Bloomberg article doesn't even support your point??

It cites a 5% drop in revenue week to week. Okay. Sucks for them. Just that the war didn't start last week. This very article has a graph in it where you can see their crude oil revenue right now is higher than it was throughout all of January. 

And again, it's only crude oil. No coal, no gas.

By even saying what he did above, he's giving credence to Russian propaganda. He should know better.

He was allowed see what the Russians wanted him to see, I doubt this journalist had to smuggle his imagery out of Mariupol up some orifice unlike the horrible images that got out through AP.

I know you know what the difference is between media in a free society and the sort of media that is posted in a society where there is only an approved narrative. The strength of Russian misinformation is that there are plenty of useful idiots who give it the same equivalence with media that comes from an open and free society.

They aren't the same thing, they just simply aren't equivalent whatsoever. This Italian journalist has taken Russian propaganda (with the usual apologist caveat) and slapped a 'Western' label on it (broadcast in Italy) whilst trying to promote Russian propaganda as objectivity ('both sides' are bad).

The real propaganda value from this 'documentary' is that I imagine we'll see this rehashed on Russian TV as 'proof' that the Westerners are 'waking up'.
