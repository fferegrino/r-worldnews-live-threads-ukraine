>\- **The United States on Tuesday accused Russia of not complying with a key nuclear arms treaty**. The only remaining treaty limiting the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) was extended for five years at the beginning of the Biden administration. It requires Russia to facilitate inspections on its territory, which it is refusing to do, the State Department said.  
>  
>\- **Ukraine’s Defense Ministry responded to a report accusing it of firing rockets carrying banned antipersonnel mines into Russian-controlled territory**. In a statement on Telegram, the ministry said Ukraine is exercising its right to self-defense, according to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. It also urged Human Rights Watch, which released the report, to pressure Russia to end its “criminal war.”  
>  
>\- **Poland and France appear open to supplying Ukraine with fighter jets, while other Western allies have said they will avoid such a move**. French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he would not rule out sending fighter jets, according to the Associated Press, while Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said in a Telegram post that they have “positive signals” from Poland as they continue to work on obtaining F-16s.

>*Battleground updates*  
>  
>\- **Although Bakhmut continues to see intense fighting, its fall is probably not imminent**, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a U.S.-based think tank. The report said Ukraine might withdraw rather than “risk unacceptable losses” should it appear that Russia is making significant progress encircling the city.

The Sumy Oblast Military Administration also reported injuries following a Russian attack on the city of Shostka on Tuesday.  
>  
>\- **Zelensky noted in his nightly address that he might shuffle around more Ukrainian officials**. He said although there had been a “lull” in personnel decisions, “this does not mean that all the necessary steps have been taken.” He added that those “who do not meet the fundamental requirements of the state and society should not linger in their chairs.”

Well then ... after the other brother made some self-determining decisions like who he wants to hang out with, in what world do you go over to your brother to kill him, rape his wife, kidnap his children, and plunder + burn his house to the ground? If they think that Ukraine moving away from Russia and towards Europe/West is Ukraine losing their way, then a good brother at the very least would let Ukrainians make their own mistakes and let them find out that the grass is not greener on the other side (which is the case of course and the Russians know it). My point is that this notion of a brother nation puts more responsibility on Russia to act with compassion, understanding, patience, and even love ... not less! If 2 countries are indifferent to each other and one acts in a way that goes really against the other country's self-interest, then I expect the moves Russia made sooner than from a brother nation. As a matter of fact, I expect no brother nation to act like Russia is acting, unless it is a psycho brother who has always tried to exert power over their kid brother, really hurting him whenever he wanted to and deriving pleasure out of it. And then throwing a sick tantrum when that dynamic and pleasure is about to be taken away from him?

I think I also pick up another underlying notion from these interviews. Like, these former USSR nations have to be loyal and thankful towards Russia and if they don't, they are not loyal and sell-outs. But was it not the other way? Russia using these nations basically as colonies to be exploited? I heard about high numbers of Ukrainians dying in World War 2, having a big military industry that Russia could use, Ukraine being a nation of intellectuals, so Russia could also use their intellectual fruits, Ukraine having access to the Black Sea with accessible ports, having fertile ground to grow crops and also having raw materials and minerals in the ground. On and on. Then, if Ukraine did not play ball according to Russia, they organized a genocide like Holodomor to shut them up? My point is, why would it not be the other way around?

IFV’s will cover the flanks, and dismount Infantry as required to suppress enemy fires from the flank positions, and airstrikes into the rear areas and key transportation/communication nodes will prevent/disrupt Russian attempts at regrouping or counterattacks.

This war is between DEMOCRACY and FASCISM. Ukraine CANNOT lose, WE cannot lose, or the world order of post-WW2 will start to crumble.

Ukraine needs MORE HELP and QUICK. This conflict is arguably the most important war since WW2, as it is fundamentally about a dying empire openly attempting to assert its barbaric ways agains't a democratic, rules based order. If it succeeds, others will be emboldened to do the same, and the western democracies will lose credibility and influence. Instability will increase, and more wars of conquest will be launched just for the hell of it by psychotic dictatorships (as if there weren't enough of them already). Russia, China and others will feel emboldened to enact OPEN GENOCIDE for their future conquests. You think the Uyghur and Ukrainian genocide are bad? It's just a taste of what they could do to - you -, to - ALL - of us should our influence crumble and fail to defend ourselves and our allies. We must wake up and STAY AWAKE or we will find ourselves, our hopes and aspirations for a better future, drowned in a nightmare of unimaginable proportions; the dark age of the 21st and 22nd century, ruled by totalitarian monsters with 0 regards for human life.

Behind their veneer of ''civism'', the totalitarian Russia and China hide a real potential to control and eradicate their rivals. The veneer of Russia has fallen because of this war, but imagine that if Russia managed to indoctrinate and scare its population into this war, China can sure as hell do the same for its own ambitions; and even better, given how state control has almost been mastered to perfection over there. And that's for a population of more than 1 billion following their newly self-appointed ''emperor'', hungry for prestige, influence, territory and natural resources.

We still have the strength and will to hold them back. But for how long? They seek to subvert our democracies through social media, bribes and mass disinformation, pitting us agains't one another and polarizing us into extreme left and extreme right, when once, western democracies leaned more to the center; trying to maintain a delicate balancing act which is becoming more and more difficult. Our military and economic might will not last if they crumble from the inside due to civil, cultural and economic strife and foreign sabotage.

Every single western politician, soldier and civilian must understand how defeat is INTOLERABLE and that no punches must be pulled.

>After studying publicly available information on the U.S. arsenal, the Ukrainians concluded that the Pentagon had a surplus of A-10s, the aging, subsonic attack aircraft known as Thunderbolts. “They can deliver heavier bombs, and we could use them against [Russian] tank columns,” he said.

It was reasonable. I said okay,” Reznikov recalled, throwing up his hands in mock surrender.

Not saying you meant to imply it but it is very important to not that corruption in western counties is not even remotely as bad as in places like Russia.

For instance my buddy in India was saying that if you don't bribe the person at the counter where you get your drivers license you'll get it in 6 months. Slip them the expected amount of money and you'll get it in a few days. Now apply that to every single government employee that you ever want to do something for you. And that includes the police, anyone that works for the government has their hand out all the time.

I'm not saying this is the example here. It might be more apt to say dozens of adults vs. hundreds of 12 year olds with potentially more coming of both the adults and 12 year olds. But if waaaaay more 12 year olds than adults show up, it'll have the same outcome. Even if so far most of losses have been among the children.

So it comes down to how many 12 year olds the Russian side can muster before a revolt or they run out vs the same question of adults for Ukraine. And Ukraine's forces only remain the equivalent of adults to children if they keep getting western resources and better training/motivation/planning. Russia *could* make their 12 year olds adults (or 14 year olds, more realistically) by training or planning. But even if that doesn't happen, unless there's a revolt, my guess is that there's a risk that Ukraine runs out of adults (or those adults slowly degrade to children) before Russia runs out of children.

I took this metaphor waaaay too far of course. But it illustrates how such a shitty force could look like they're losing until suddenly they're not.

It feels like so much time is wasted over ""will they / won't they"" and ""which aircraft"", and then there's 6+ months of training, all so you can say Ukraine did it because Russia will totally not say NATO did it anyway, right?  Ukraine won't get it done as well as we would ourselves (at first), and don't have the logistics and support (yet), we have all that.  Why don't we quit wasting time and just fucking get to it, Russia's going to cry it's NATO or US or whatever either way.  We can upgrade Ukraine's airforce and all the rest to NATO standard whatever after this shit is over and done with.

Are we gonna bring Ukraine into NATO after this?  Yes?  Maybe?  Then we should start defending them like a *potential* NATO member instead of this arms length bullshit.  All this waffling just makes me think we are still trying to nickle and dime a L for Russia outta this mess at the cost of Ukrainian lives while we keep holding back the really good shit.

I’d say the opinions are mixed, which is pretty on-brand for Moscow - we have 20+ mil living and working people here, a good chunk of them are not even born in Moscow, some are not even Russian citizens. Not everybody is here to be a conscious member of society, many are for the money and education - which is understandable. St. Petersburg has a more unified voice, which is why they were showing anti-government sentiment better.  People here form up small social bubbles where you are free to voice your opinions - almost no one in my crowd ever voiced a Pro-Putin statement, let alone pro-war sentiment. I know 2  people that volunteered to the front,  but those are friends of a friend. It’s quite tough to find yourself in a crowd with different opinion, and even though government put SVO banners everywhere, Z-patriots themselves have been reluctant to voice their support in public, especially after several work scandals and cars being burned down.  

If I had to generalise, I’d say Gen Zs are more willing to openly criticise the government and have more anti-war people in their numbers. People of my generation, which are commonly called as “the lost generation” (late 80s-early 90s) have more neutral views and older folks vary from pro-war Anti-Putin, to anti-war Pro-Putin. Then we have Donetsk and Luhansk refugees which skew those views even further. 


Majority of Russian war crimes is mostly cut out of Russian side of Internet, just like Reddit prefers not to show photos of Ukrainian soldier cooking Russian soldier’s head (although some videos did appear on r/combatfootage) - Newsmedia doesn’t report on them, so the only way to see them is to intentionally look for them - and who would do that? Although some bots spam the images and videos in VK, a lot of them are taken with a grain of salt. The only war crimes that are being reported (with a classic, neutral and dry style), are the rocket attacks since “Ukraine kills its own citizens by taking down the rockets”.

There's an ancient common saying ""Богато не жили и нечего начинать"" which originally called for having a modest way of life, but was twisted throughout ages into ""we have never lived well and we shouldn't"" - mix in Soviet influence, bad experience with Capitalism and Democracy in 90s and you get a horrible monstrous mentality of deep folk which are logically free to move up class, but are not willing to, and since they are stuck in that, they want for everyone to be stuck with them.   


Aside that, well, things are ok. Sure, I can't easily fly to Czech Republic but that's not a life-crushing moment. I finally took a flight to Vladivostok - something I've wanted to do for a while, but have been ignoring in favor of going to Cyprus or Switzerland. So did the others - a lot of people were traveling domestically. As for common goods, luxury items, tech and stuff - we still have our leftover stocks from companies that have left or buy imported stuff instead of ""officially licensed"" one. I keep telling this story, but here's a fun fact - before sanctions we only had normal Coke and Coke Zero being officially released in Russia, you could find French imported Coke in scarce amounts - nowadays you can find ""Intergalactic Limited Edition"" Coke in a majority of stores in Moscow, imported from all parts of Europe. Sure it's twice as expensive as a normal Coke can, but it's available. And everyone not willing to pay that price are buying ""Добрый Cola"" which is 95-99% same product as previously official Coke, since it's essentually made from the same sources at the same facility. ""Vkusno i Tochka"" is just as tasteless as ""McDonalds"", although without quality check, so it's a bit more random sometimes and russian ""Burger King"" straight up said ""fuck you"" to OG company and continues to exist under the same brand. You can still buy IKEA, because most of furniture manufacturers were local, and you can order tech from China. People buy PS games via Ukrainian PSN store, which is as disgusting and ironic as it can get. I have yet to hear about major job cuts and planes going down, though. The moment it turns out they can't service Boeing anymore (even via parts swapping) - then it will get interesting.

2. If you absolutely must link, link to something that summarizes the flaws in their argument, and one that does not link to source material.

They can and do intercept HIMARS missiles, so they certainly would not have any difficulty killing a much bigger, less agile radar profile like an F-16. And S-300s, a much older technology, are also easily capable of killing an F-16 or peer jet like the Mig-29.

The reason that Russian SAMs have had problems with HIMARS is because Ukraine often fires them in a school of decoy MLRS rockets that are hard to distinguish between. Russia also doesn't have an unlimited stockpile of expensive S-400 missiles, so they try to conserve them for bigger threats than the daily barrages of Ukrainian GMLRS, like fat, juicy aircraft radar profiles.

>Same with MiG-31, they don't enter Ukr airspace, and they would be shot down if they entered.

The entire reason the Mig-31 is a hard counter for F-16s is that it doesn't *have* to enter Ukrainian airspace. Most Ukrainian airplanes these days are killed by Mig-31s that fire R-71 long-range interceptor missiles from high altitudes deep behind Russian lines. Ukraine has zero ability to counter this tactic, and if they were given a few dozen F-16s, they would still have zero ability to counter it. Ukraine would have to continue using F-16s in the same way they use their Soviet aircraft today -- by flying them extremely low to the ground, in Ukrainian held territory only, in very small numbers and in very infrequent sorties.

Before launch, it was set to count backwards from a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions. As the missile flew, the airflow turned the propeller, and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted down one number on the odometer.

And members of Gosduma are complete idiots -  if you watched ""Shin Gojira"", you might remember the scenes where government workers argue in which room they should hold the briefing, or the one where military calls the office to ask permissions to shoot and then they repeat that very same question to several people on different ranks with no one taking responsibility - that's them.

It's basically:

1. Subsistence farming economy, poor access to medical treatments = large number of children, a significant % never reaching adulthood (50%). Population steady or growing slowly, depending on agricultural cycles and epidemic events.
2. Transition from subsistence farming to industrial/urban lifestyle. access to modern medicine = large number of children, almost all living to adulthood (this is where the big population spike happens). Everyone has food enough to survive, all children live to adulthood and have families of their own.
3. Industrial/urban lifestyle - no need to have large families (you don't need help on the farm anymore), more leisure options, more career options, more wealth generating options. Population starts to stagnate.
4. Modern lifestyle - having children is no longer the primary goal of individuals. Living as full a life as possible and enjoying it are more important. Families have children later and later in life, usually below replacement rate (1-2 max). Population declines.

So you go from high birthrate/mortality->high birthrate->stable birthrate->low birthrate, but at the same time human life expectency and quality of life increases. Unless you think being ""a dung farmer"" was a satisfying and fulfilling life.

Lower birthrates are the sign of an advanced society that gives it's adult and aging population enough to do and be without the need to define itself by its offspring.",False,1675248633.0,t3_10qjzw8,t1_j6r5xjj,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

So you are aware that there are multiple definitions of mainland and peninsula, yet when the original poster claimed that Crimea was part of the mainland, why did you write that what they said ""makes little sense""?

If there are multiple definitions, then the reality is that whether or not Crimea is part of mainland Ukraine is a matter of which definition of the word we choose to be the correct one.

Even now you say ""And I knew the information was correct."",  despite being shown multiple times by me that there is an alternative definition.
