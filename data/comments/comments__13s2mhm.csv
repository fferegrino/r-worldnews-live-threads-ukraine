Day 455-457 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past couple of days definitely weren‚Äôt the quietest, while it was mostly quiet in the city itself, Russians launched the biggest Shahed attack aimed at Kharkiv oblast yet. To clarify, it‚Äôs not the biggest Shahed attack they‚Äôve done in general, just the biggest one for our region. They very rarely use them to strike Kharkiv oblast, so it‚Äôs notable when they do a big attack using Shaheds. 

They launched 18 drones at some of our towns, including Izyum and Merefa, they damaged some infrastructure, but thankfully I don‚Äôt think there were any casualties. They also launched a couple of missile strikes from Belgorod, and used some of their long-range bombs near the border, all of them aimed at some targets in Kharkiv oblast. None of their strikes were aimed at Kharkiv itself, but sometimes we did still hear the distant explosions. 

Those bastards hit a regular hospital and a veterinary clinic in Dnipro with missiles this morning, what is the point in doing this? It won‚Äôt make anyone be afraid of them, it just makes us hate them even more. So, they used a couple of missiles, that are worth millions of dollars, to kill a couple of already injured people and animals? Other than it being a monstrous thing to do, it‚Äôs also a giant waste of resources. It‚Äôs basically a self-sabotage, who even approves such actions?",False,1685141909.0,t3_13s2mhm,t3_13s2mhm,,0,124,0,124,0,0,

Another üá∑üá∫ missile attack, another crime against humanity as such. The buildings of a psychological clinic and a veterinary clinic in the city of Dnipro were destroyed. As of now, one person was killed and 15 were wounded. The shelling aftermath is being eliminated and the victims are being rescued. All necessary services are involved.

Only an evil state can fight against clinics. There can be no military purpose in this. It is pure üá∑üá∫ terror.

Russia has chosen the path of evil of its own will, and it will not abandon this path by itself. We must defeat terror and we will do it. Ukraine and the entire free world together.

Thank you to everyone in the world who helps us!

>  
>*The aircraft will restore an edge to Kyiv‚Äôs forces and push Moscow‚Äôs pilots back into Russia*  
>  
>Many have questioned why President Volodymyr Zelenskyy so determinedly pressed for the supply of F-16 fighter planes to his forces in Ukraine. Can one particular aircraft make such a difference? The answer, in the case of the F-16, is yes.  
>  
>In using the G7 summit to announce that the US would help train Ukrainian pilots to fly the aircraft, Joe Biden tied his allies into the decision. In effect, Zelenskyy hijacked the event so that major nations swung in behind Ukraine, just as the Russian military leadership appeared to be turning on itself.  
>  
>Biden‚Äôs initial reticence on F-16 training was the fear of escalation. That the White House has overcome this caution suggests that their risk appetite has increased. Its other concern was that the Ukrainians would not be able to operate these jets effectively. NATO would usually package F-16s with a full range of supporting aircraft that are considered essential to their operations: electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defences and airborne command and control. Without these, critics argued, the planes would be of little use.  
>  
>The easiest charge to dismiss is that it would take 18 months to train Ukrainian pilots. Recent US Air Force trials proved that even though the F-16 is a high-performance fighter, experienced Ukrainian pilots could learn to fly it in four months.  
>  
>In fact, Ukrainian forces have integrated western weapons on ex-Soviet aircraft in timescales that should embarrass our own peacetime processes. There are legitimate questions about who does deep maintenance on this western aircraft, but maintaining the F-16 on the frontline should not be an issue: it is a straightforward, single-engine aircraft, produced in great numbers, and so spare parts are plentiful.  
>  
>The far bigger issue is who sustains the supply of western air-to-air missiles. The US Amraam is very capable but cost an estimated $1mn each. The longer-range European Meteor is even more expensive. While national war stock levels are understandably classified, it is an open secret that most NATO air forces are short. Allies would do well to accelerate their missile supply chains as a matter of urgency.  
>  
>The lack of supporting air power is harder to remedy. Of course, Ukraine cannot replicate NATO support functions. But it doesn‚Äôt have to: Kyiv is not seeking a package of expeditionary air power, operating at range, deep into enemy territory. It only needs to keep the Russian air force (VKS) on the back foot in the skies over Ukraine.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The F-16, with its longer-range radars, sensors and missiles, would restore the Ukrainian air force‚Äôs edge both qualitatively and quantitatively ‚Äî and push the VKS back into Russia. That will, in turn, protect both Ukraine‚Äôs ground forces and its critical infrastructure. But boosting its effectiveness in the absence of wider air power packaging will require imagination.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Finally, there is a moral dimension to consider. NATO would fight Russia by winning the air battle first, and then using air superiority to drive a more efficient land battle. Given the weakness of the VKS, this is no pipe dream. But the west‚Äôs constrained donations to date have forced Ukraine to pursue grinding land tactics. We have restricted Kyiv to fighting in a way that we would not, and to take casualties that we would not.  
>  
>If we want Russia to be defeated, we should reverse this position. The F-16 decision is a big step in the right direction. These jets may not arrive in time to aid Ukraine‚Äôs spring offensive, but the announcement will already be influencing military and political calculations in the Kremlin. The F-16 is not a panacea, but a totem of a fairer fight.

‚ÄúThe decision to deliver F-16s, that has not yet been made,‚Äù Mark Rutte told journalists during a news conference. ‚ÄúAgain, American permission first applies for this. If you‚Äôre going to train, it‚Äôs obvious that you would seriously think about it. But it has not yet been decided.‚Äù

The Netherlands is leading the joint training mission, together with Belgium and the United Kingdom, Rutte said. There are additional European countries who have told the Dutch government they are interested in helping, he added.

Rutte said starting the training mission was important, but the discussion on actually sending planes should happen separately.

Rutte did acknowledge the Netherlands has a fleet of F-16s that it will no longer need, as it transitions to the fifth-generation F-35 fighter jet. But when pressed by a journalist, he refused to comment on any Dutch desire to send those planes to Ukraine.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-26-23/index.html

""US President Joe Biden's administration has reiterated in conversations with Ukraine that it does not support attacks on Russian soil, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN Thursday.

‚ÄúWe have again made it very clear to the Ukrainians what our expectations are about attacking Russia ‚Äî we don't want to encourage or enable that, we certainly don't want any US-made equipment used to attack Russian soil,‚Äù Kirby told CNN‚Äôs Wolf Blitzer.

‚ÄúAnd we have gotten assurances from the Ukrainians that they will respect those wishes ‚Ä¶ we have been very clear that we want Ukraine to be able to defend its own soil, its own territory. They have been attacked. They have been invaded. They have a right to defend themselves,"" he continued. ""But, we've also been clear, well, that we don't want to see this war escalate beyond this, the devastation and the violence that is already visited on the Ukrainian people.‚Äù

The conversations with Ukraine didn‚Äôt involve ‚Äúoutlining consequences‚Äù but were ‚Äúsimply a reaffirmation,"" Kirby told CNN. He added that these discussions have happened ""as recently as over just the last day or so.""

Some context: Kirby's comments come on the heels of a CNN report that anti-Putin Russian fighters, fighting alongside Ukrainian armed forces, conducted a raid inside Russian territory. 

In an interview with CNN‚Äôs Sam Kiley, one of the Russian nationals said the raid was conducted using American-manufactured equipment purchased on the open market. Kirby said Thursday that he could not confirm that.

He instead said the US is providing equipment ""to be used to defend Ukrainian soil.""""",False,1685100996.0,t3_13s2mhm,t3_13s2mhm,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Don't get me wrong, the russian state is alive, but in many ways, it has been dying since Andropov and Yeltsin did a sneaky on Gorby. They never recovered from the collapse. The system today is a mish mash of the worst of imperial, soviet and kleptocrat Russia, all kept in place to sate a cabal of cronies surrounding one deluded, paranoid shitheel. 

You can see it permiating the system. Where we see chaos, the reality is that the system is dead, but the people inhabiting it does not know it is. It has been transformed without change several times over, but everything stays the same.

Take the army for instance. Pre war, they portrayed the RU army as a top power. High tech, numerous and strong. What we have seen since those terrible days in february 22, is a russian army, high on the nationalistic fervor of the tsarist era, strucured and led as the red army, only inhabiting those leader positions are kleptocrats from the collapse era and sychophants from the neo authocratic era. 

It's a confused mess, and at this point, applying paedagogy might be useful. We are taught that agression and irrational behaviour in young persons are often the result of not achieving while being aware of shortcomings. I believe the irrational atrocities we see, are the russian state lasing out in just this way. The entire state is a mess so in disarray and tattered by their own mistreatment and mismanagement  that to fix it, they must tear it down. The powers see this and at this point, the only thing they can do to eminate a shred of power is to attack the weakest targets.

**The Kremlin Has a Security Problem**

*Drone attacks in Moscow, incursions over the border‚ÄîRussians are starting to wonder whether Putin really does have, as he promised, ‚Äúeverything under control.‚Äù*

By Anna Nemtsova


President Vladimir Putin sustains his power on the promise to Russians that he has, as he put it in 2010, ‚Äúeverything under control.‚Äù This week‚Äôs attack on the southern Belgorod region, launched from Ukraine, would have been alarming under any circumstances, but Putin‚Äôs posture as the man in command makes it particularly hard to explain away.

A string of bad news that began earlier this month suggests to Russians that their security system is crumbling. First came the drone attack on the roof of Putin‚Äôs residence in the Kremlin on May 4. Now comes an incursion into Belgorod, demonstrating that a year and a half into the war, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, which is in charge of the borders, does not have the manpower to protect against small units attacking from Ukraine. Russia was not even able to secure a nearby storage site for nuclear-weapons components, known as Belgorod-22‚Äîinstead it reportedly moved the materiel away.

Russians in the border regions are beginning to realize that the war that has destroyed dozens of towns and villages in Ukraine is coming to their own land. Nobody seemed to be defending Belgorod, so on Tuesday, locals demanded answers from their governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, in a live chat on Vkontakte, a social-networking site.

Governor Gladkov read the questions aloud: ‚ÄúThey said that everything was under control, that fortifications have been built, some pyramids and so on, but the enemy is coming to our regional center by tanks. Why is the border full of holes?‚Äù he read from one message. ‚ÄúAnd we are not mentioning the constant artillery and mortar fire, wounded residents‚Äîhow come?‚Äù


The complaint seemed valid enough. And the more information that emerged, the more the episode risked turning the entire nationalist rationale behind Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine back on the Kremlin: The invaders were Russian nationalists serving in the Ukrainian armed forces who claimed that they were liberating Russia from Putin‚Äôs regime.

Somebody had to be honest with locals, and Governor Gladkov, surprisingly, was. ‚ÄúI agree with you,‚Äù he said, looking tired and grim. ‚ÄúI have many more questions for the Defense Ministry than you.‚Äù He called on his listeners to draw their own conclusions ‚Äúfrom the mistakes that have been made.‚Äù

Russians have been drawing conclusions rather quickly this week. Thousands jumped into their vehicles and left their villages in the Belgorod region, without waiting for further explanation or assistance from the security services. One video shows local residents trying to break into an old Soviet bomb shelter, screaming at the top of their lungs.

Ilya Ponomarev is a former member of Russia‚Äôs Parliament now in exile. He acts as a spokesperson for the Freedom of Russia Legion, the anti-Kremlin group that crossed into the Belgorod region. Ponomarev told me that the legion‚Äôs soldiers were ‚Äújust four kilometers away‚Äù from the Belgorod-22 nuclear-storage site, and that the group‚Äôs goal was to demonstrate to Russians that their border was unprotected.

The attack seems to have struck its psychological target. Tsargrad, a nationalist television channel in Russia, headlined a program with the question of whether, after a year of ‚Äúbombs raining on ‚Ä¶ Russian regions,‚Äù the ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in Ukraine was coming to resemble the second Chechen war. The comparison jabbed at dark memories of fighting that killed thousands of civilians in the Northern Caucasus and created streams of internal migrants.

Now again, Russians have been internally displaced. ‚ÄúThis is just a shock; there is no safe place in the south,‚Äù 72-year-old Nina Mikhailova, a pensioner from Russia‚Äôs Krasnodar region, south of Belgorod, told me by phone on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThere is no end to this war, to killings, and nobody tells us when or how it will end. The jokes and threats about nuclear mushrooms are not funny. If the only solution is to nuke America, we are all in real trouble.‚Äù

Boris Vishnevsky, a city-council member in St. Petersburg, is one of the very few opposition figures left in government in Russia. I spoke with him by phone yesterday. Russia‚Äôs generals, he observed, can ‚Äúpromise us to destroy everything alive coming our way‚Äù‚Äîbut then they will come up against the problem that ‚Äúthe FSB, who are actually responsible for protecting the borders, are busy hunting down and imprisoning Russians for their posts on social media.‚Äù

This week, some of my Russian friends said they caught themselves walking around with their mouths open in absolute shock. ‚ÄúThe border is supposed to be protected by the FSB, but it is not; they just look more and more like some dumb thugs,‚Äù a former Russian member of parliament, Gennady Gudkov, himself a veteran of the KGB, told me on Tuesday. Like many of his friends and colleagues in Moscow, he gasped at the news of tanks and armored vehicles rolling from Ukraine to Russia, unstopped. Nothing was under control.

Putin pretends to love history. While his security services were in Belgorod chasing armed invaders from Ukraine, he was staring at a French map, allegedly dated from the mid-17th century, with the word Ukraine on it, but still insisting that Ukraine did not exist before the Soviet times.

Meanwhile, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, is building political capital from every failure of the Russian military. When the attack began from Ukraine, and the legion took over village after village, Prigozhin took aim at the armed forces on his Telegram channel: ‚ÄúInstead of providing security for the state, some of them are dividing cash and the others make fools of themselves. There is no leadership, no desire and no personalities ready to defend their country.‚Äù

Ukraine, however, is only getting stronger, according to Prigozhin: ‚ÄúUkraine had 500 tanks in the beginning of our special operation and now they have 5,000. If before, 20,000 of their men knew how to fight, now 400,000 men know how to fight. So it turns out we militarized them in a big way.‚Äù

Prigozhin has predicted an apocalyptic ending for Putin‚Äôs regime as a result of the attack on Belgorod. ‚ÄúPeople will come out with pitchforks to the streets,‚Äù he told Russian media. When that day arrives, he warns, he will be the one taking the situation under control: ‚ÄúAnd then we come.‚Äù",False,1685094399.0,t3_13s2mhm,t1_jlnwud9,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

I really want to see pro Ukraine people stop using this one. First of all there is still a lot of support for Ukraine within the GOP and by implying that the entire GOP is against Ukraine it actually can serve to weaken support for Ukraine by Republicans. Zelensky has repeatedly welcomed members of both Dems and Republicans to Kyiv and he absolutely does not want to see Ukraine funding turned into a partisan issue. Overstating the extent of Republican opposition to Ukraine threatens just that.

Similarly the idea that ""Trump will win and take away funding"" is also really damaging. We're at day 457 of the full scale invasion and there are over 600 days until Trump could take office (if he wins which is less than likely). Ukraine has just received long range missiles and in the next couple months they'll get F-16s, more tanks, more artillery and more of everything. Even if the war is still going on this time next year there is a very solid chance that Russia is driven out before January 20th 2025. Worrying about a hypothetical Trump presidency at this point carries the implicit assumption that Ukraine is not capable of winning the war in the next 600+ days.

1) Claim that it was actually guarding some pipelines there, and is still on location performing its duties.

2) Claim that it was lightly damaged, but was making way toward Novorossiysk under its own power.

3) Pictures of it allegedly sailing into Novorossiysk port, no damage. (This one was already debunked, as the actual picture was 2 years old.)

4) Pictures of it allegedly entering Sevastopol port, no damage.

Anyway, I think a lot of people aren't looking at it with the background she had, and the background Germany had. She is from the GDR/DDR. You don't simply reunite a country in a matter of a few years, it takes a lot longer, even now the differences are still there between West and East Germany. Economical growth was everything Germany cared for, so it could balance the differences better. East Germany was Russias parade state, there were many ties on all levels. 

It was only natural to be somewhat thankful for the opportunity given to have a complete country again and so they made business with Russia, to help them out of their misery too. Germany always was the bridge between West and East, it tried to stay a little unaligned, despise being in NATO. USA (mainly Texas senators who wanted to sell their LNG) telling them they cant buy Russian gas and they gonna sanction them, eventhough Germany is a sovereign country, was hilarious and I think wrong.

Merkel knew the world wasnt perfect but always prefered to talk it out, so there wont be the necessity for military intervention. And I strongly believe, even if not many will agree here, IF we wouldnt have tried to solve it diplomatically for years, but instead set a course for confrontation/escalation with Russia early on - Russia would have invaded Ukraine fully in 2014 or the years after and it would have been awfully unprepared. Russia would have set up their puppet regime. In 2014 Ukraine was a military nobody, too infilitrated by Russian assets and with too much corruption.

I can only think for three reasons, they were the furthest from the Soviet Union, some kind of Stockholm complex, and finally East Germany may have been one of the best places to live in the Warsaw pack.

They then increase the capacity of one of the input streams of such gas. And because that's a cheap source, they utilize more of that capacity. And therefore utilize less of *other* input streams/sources. Isn't it then likely that the capacity of other input streams reduces (because everything depreciates)?  And consider that the capacity of an input stream isn't just at the local infrastructural level (e.g., pipelines). Part of the capacity of an input stream / source of gas will be determined outside of the country, i.e., how willing and able suppliers are to supply you.

So alternative capacity that might otherwise be available won't be developed and ready to use. In other words, if it hadn't been for the pipelines from russia, Germany might already have had LNG port infrastructure built. But because they didn't need it, they didn't.  So they couldn't just stop buying gas from Russia whenever it wanted to (well, not without a lot of pain) until it built/established replacement input-stream capacity.

(I've not written the above very well, but if you think in terms of the capacities of sources of gas, then it becomes easier to understand why it became all too easy to become too dependent on russian gas. Sure, germany probably should have invested in and established alternative sources (extra capacity), but that would cost large amounts of extra money for very possibly no return, and capital doesn't tend to seek out such projects.)",1685118646.0,1685118378.0,t3_13s2mhm,t1_jlppjuh,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

- Ilya Yashin. One of the closest allies of Nemtsov. Very solid and steady in his support of liberal democracy. Currently jailed in Russia.

- Kasparov. Staunch Putin opponent for decades. Smart. Living in exile (New York, I think). A little too much left-leaning (and that's Russia we are talking about). But way better than most politicians remaining in Russia.

- Nikita Belykh. Old school liberal democrat. Never supported Putin or his wars. Currently jailed in Russia.

- Zhanna Nemtsova. Nemtsov's daughter. Not leaving in Russia, never supported Putin (obviously). Used to live and work in Ukraine. And I'd love to see a woman be in charge in Russia.

- Herman Gref. Putin's ally, a ""technocrat"" with a surprising (for a Russian) anti-corruption track record. Never supported the war. Openly opposed the Feb 24 escalation. Staunch supporter of liberal values in the economy, though keeping his mouth shut about the same in the politics. Currently a head of the biggest financial institution in Russia. Not in danger of being jailed. Could be the best transitional figure.

There are probably others jailed or exiled politicians, who are not connected to Navalny. And among the Navalny people there are quite a few notable politicians as well.

Upd: there are also some people who are not politicians but could be good fit for the role. Vladimir Kara-murza (a lawyer, jailed) and Igor Yakovenko (a journalist, exiled) are a couple of examples. Yakovenko would not stay in that role for long though - he is a strong anti-imperialist and one of his first actions would be to divide Russia into smaller countries :)",1685125505.0,1685124087.0,t3_13s2mhm,t1_jlpxbdh,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

He also has next to no support within Russia. He's much more popular in the West than internally. There's next to no chance of him getting into and staying in the top job, but he can be an effective member of some sort of a coalition government.

[Edit] In a binary world in which the only two options are ""Navalny should be the next tzar"" and ""Putin propaganda"" then yes I'll choose Navalny. But in the real world I really hope there's a third option for Russia.

Navalny is a Russian nationalist who for most of his career openly and proudly claimed that Russia's manifest destiny is to be the Big Brother to all the smaller stupider nations. He never walked that back or addressed it. Don't take my word for it. Here's Kamil Galeev, a much better candidate for the future of Russia, an opposition figure with far cleaner pedigree who also did time for opposing Putin.

Even a quick glance down his wiki page: 

* 2005 Started the ball rolling on Nord Stream 1
- 2009 joined the board at TNK-BP (BP's venture with Russian gas)
- 2007 Estonian Soviet War Monument removal criticism 
- 2008 blamed the invasion of Georgia on Saakashvili and the west
- 2014 falsely equivocated Russia's invasion of Crimea to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia to stop Slobodan Milo≈°evic from committing genocide.
- 2016 became manager of Nord Stream 2 project (which I will remind you, started the ball rolling in 2011/12 before the invasion of Crimea)
- 2017 nominated to the board of Rosneft
- 2022 nominated to the board of Gazprom

Yeah, Merkel had serious problems with Putin and his invasion in 2014 too, (I would label her a naive neo-liberal who thought you could tame a dictator with economic trade), but she is nowhere near as in bed with the Russians as Schroeder.

It should also be noted as well that this naivete was extremely common in German politics in the past 20+ years. There was hope for Russia in the early 2000's that with their resource wealth expanding that they could modernize their economy and join the rest of Europe as a productive member. That hope should have been seriously questioned in 2008 after Putin's ""demotion"" to Prime Minister under Medvedev and again in 2011/2012 with Putin's brutal crackdown on the Snow Revolution, but it wasn't. That will undoubtedly be one of her greatest foreign policy failings, but like everything in life, history, and politics there's nuance and it's difficult to make accurate judgements in real time.

Even if that were so, Russia would shift to more drone attack systems anyway. If that is the main motive you are placing on the thought of destroying their planes, then sending even more air defense capability makes more sense for preventing attacks on civilian targets.

A lot of the air-launched missile attacks are happening from so far behind the front-lines that no amount of additional AA would be able to hit the launch platforms. Instead the AA is spent intercepting the incoming missiles instead which puts a higher economic load on UA.

>Destroying aircraft isn't going to 'force Russia to start spending more money now'.

If Russia can not air-launch missiles into Ukraine, then they need to expend more expensive sea-launched and land-launched missiles instead. An air launched missile is cheaper, because it starts its journey at high altitude and with the velocity of the aircraft already. Missiles being launched from the sea/ground need to expend MUCH more energy to climb to altitude and gain speed.

Taking out Russias air-launch platforms when they are on the ground does make attacking Ukraine more expensive and less effective.

Ironically, that suggests that the Kinzhals (which are air-launched) Russia is using _are_ actually going for military targets (like air defense systems, Patriot, etc.) which makes them more relevant in a military sense (even if it's for protecting the air-defense systems we send).

> Even if that were so, Russia would shift to more drone attack systems anyway.

Given recent results, I think the drones are becoming less and less effective over time. They're quite slow and noisy to begin with, so I think they (in long-range use) had value mostly out of novelty rather than being tactically viable long-term.

> then sending even more air defense capability makes more sense for preventing attacks on civilian targets.

And, not or. Also worth noting that Russia gets to decide where missiles go, so forcing Ukraine to allocate sufficient air defense capability _everywhere_ to fend off attack gives Russia a strategic advantage in resourcing.

>intentional massacre of a civilian population

Citation needed.

Targeting military infrastructure, like tank factories and logistical infrastructure that's actively being used to transport troops and military equipment (not to mention the rail being used to transport concentration camp prisoners being forced to work at said factories), isn't intentional targeting civilians. Both Kurt Vonnegut and the city of Dresden disagree with you...

Using the talking point that Dresden was targeted for it's cultural significance and targeting civilians is literally revisionist history created by Goebbels after the bombing for use as Nazi propaganda.
