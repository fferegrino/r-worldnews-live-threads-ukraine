The northern area is better for Russia since their logistics actually have a chance of working but their ability to penetrate deep is still limited exactly because of logistics.

If Ukraine can blunt the Russian offensive without tying down their reserves, the breakthrough in the south will be very possible but Toveri thinks that Ukrainian forces might have to suspend their offensive near Bakhmut for that.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,151r1pz,jscdf0e,"War criminal Girkin is predicting Turkey will have a direct military clash with Russia:

“The moment of truth is getting closer.

Or rather, the time is getting closer when my oldest (from the beginning of the Syrian campaign) forecasts about the development of the situation in the ""Ukraine-Turkey-Syria"" connection will come true.

For those who did not read and did not listen to me in 2015-2016, I remind (point by point) my theses, which have never changed since then and have not become (in my opinion) less likely:

Sooner or later, the Russian Federation will have to enter into a direct military clash with Turkey on the initiative of the latter. The fighting will take place in Syria, in the Transcaucasus and on the Black Sea. 

The direct participation of large contingents of Turkish troops (under the guise of ""volunteers"" or even without such cover) in operations against our army in Ukraine and Crimea is not ruled out.

The Turks will begin to move on to a direct open confrontation with the Russian Federation after they ""squeeze dry"" from the Kremlin's amazing people all the concessions that can be obtained peacefully. 

Then they will begin to put pressure with military force. The Turks will choose the moment of entry into the war, taking into account the maximum weakening of the military forces of the Russian Federation and our unpreparedness to repel Turkish aggression.

The first stage will be the closure of the Bosporus and Dardanelles for our fleet and supply ships delivering reinforcements to Syria (Erdogan may take this step this year).

This will be followed by a series of armed provocations in Syria by the so-called. ""armed opposition"" against our troops in order to expand the zone of control of the pro-Turkish authorities. 

After waiting for the depletion of ammunition and supplies, Turkish troops will try to completely defeat our expeditionary force and Syrian troops in northern Syria. 

Naturally, only the Russian Federation and official Damascus will be blamed for the escalation of the conflict.

Our expeditionary corps cut off from supplies and reinforcements, won't have a chance to defeat the Turkish army.

The fate of our peacekeeping contingent in Karabakh and Armenia seems just as unenviable. It will be crushed and (at best) interned by the Armenians, or simply destroyed and captured by the Turkish-Azerbaijani coalition.

The only thing that can deter the Turks (apart from the direct threat of the use of nuclear weapons, which could lead to a worldwide nuclear war) from defeating our troops in Syria is the direct intervention of Iran and its readiness to directly enter into a military confrontation with Turkey in Syria and the Transcaucasus (I remind you that Turkey is now strenuous friends with the main opponents of Iran - Israel).

In any case, even if Ankara does not dare to go into a full-scale military conflict with the Russian Federation, the Turks will ""strangle"" our group in Syria, since all communications are based on sea supplies through Novorossiysk to Tartus, and blocking the airspace with Syria is also not a problem for the Turks .

The question of the timely withdrawal of our expeditionary force in Syria has long been ""overcooked"", but has not yet been raised as such. 

A large group of our military remains  Erdogan’s “hostage"". We can expect with high probability that the long-awaited rejection of the shameful and senseless ""grain deal"" will set in motion a chain of consequences that naturally leads to a sharp aggravation of Russian-Turkish relations and an acceleration of Turkey's inevitable transition to the camp of our open enemies.

The time allotted for the possibility of evacuating our troops from Syria during the ""deal"" is apparently lost forever.”

To block entry of vehicles into Crimea, there is only one spot you can target that will achieve that and that's the bridge. For rail, there is only a single connection between Crimea and the land bridge, so there are other opportunities to disrupt the flow of goods. There are many other bridges that Ukraine can reliably hit like Chongar. They can sabotage rail operations to make things very difficult for Russia. Probably Russia will have to cross the bridge with rail, then unload everything and truck it over, which is a real pain for them.

I think the important part here is that unlike last time, road traffic is completely stopped. Last time there were still lanes open on one side of the bridge. But this time, both sides are out.

[Wikipedia (edited)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOS-1)

> TOS-1 (Heavy Flamethrower System) is a Soviet 220 mm 30-barrel or 24-barrel multiple rocket launcher capable of using thermobaric warheads, mounted on a T-72 tank chassis. TOS-1 was designed to attack enemy fortified positions and lightly armoured vehicles and transports, particularly in open terrain.

The Kerch bridge has, I believe, two road spans and a rail span. The reports say one road span is down but trains are running. I've yet to see anything convincing on damage assessment, certainly some of the photos show a single  span of road bridge down.

If the other span of the bridge is sound they'll run all the traffic over the other span at least halving road capacity, till it is repaired.

Logistically there are big military resources on the Russian mainland side of the bridge, beyond the reach of most Ukrainian rockets (but not their assassins it seems).

It is consistent with just degrading Russian logistics further. Ukraine is clearly going after Russian artillery and ammunition for that artillery. Heavy artillery also needs a steady supply of barrels and these things take a lot of wear when firing. 

This attack will make it harder to replenish supplies and move people. If the bridge is mostly open the practical effect will mostly be disruption, but there is a psychological effect. Realise that Ukraine has no effective Navy but seems able to strike a bridge which is a long way from the frontline fairly regularly. Occupiers in Ukraine must also wonder if they'll be able to retreat quickly  should they need to leave in a hurry.

There must also be the concern that Ukraine will strike the bridge again to take out remaining parts that work. I've also wondered how exposed the repair team is. I don't know how many people Russia has who know how to repair this bridge, but I did wonder if they might be a target, or even just collateral damage if they strike at the other parts of the bridge.",False,1689579051.0,t3_151r1pz,t1_jsagsm5,,1,22,0,22,0,0,

Both road spans are temporarily down though which wasn't the case last round.  It would take an expert to guess on a repair timeframe, and a different expert to say which types of supply will be affected by the lack of roads versus which use the rail.

The interesting thing to me is that this is probably a repeatable action.  The consensus guess for now seems to be that Ukraine sent submersible drones from the Odesa/Mykolaiv coastal area all the way around to cause a large explosion.  If russia cannot stop that we will see more of these until the bridge is unusable.  I wouldn't even be shocked if Ukraine had a supply ready to go before they started with it, and continue with nightly attacks.

The Kerch bridge provides one of each for Russia, though they were already limited in their ability to handle heavy traffic after Ukraine's first strike on the bridge.  

While the other road and railway go over the landcorridor, the railway is much further north than the mainroad and any push from Ukraine forces deeper south run the risk of cutting that supply line as well. 
  
But even a total collapse of the bridge, as well as stopping the railway over the landbridge would not stop all supplies flowing in from Russia, as there are still ferries and smaller roads left. They would not be able to handle nearly the supply needed, but Russians forces in the south would not suddenly run out of ammo, shells and fuel from one day to the next. Rather there woiuld be a repeat on the situation of their forces stuck on the west bank in Kherson before retreating. Except much bigger in scale.

To detect a radar system, all you need to do is to listen for it screaming into the darkness. You don’t need to emit any signal of your own. This is what anti-radiation missiles like AGM-88 HARM do. You throw it in a general direction, and it guides itself like a moth to a flame. This capability can also be done from the ground, but it’s less effective and more difficult because working out something’s location when you can’t get direct line of sight on it is hard. It’s not good enough to know roughly where the radar is - you need to know to within a few metres.

The challenge is that counter battery radar is often small and portable. To avoid being pasted by HARMs, Russia has had to switch off its radars intermittently and move them around. That allows them to interrupt the mission loop for AGM-88 in current Ukrainian service, which can only be launched in pre-briefed mode.

One argument for F-16 is that it can be fitted with a HARM Targeting Pod. That’s just a really powerful set of listening devices that can identify, classify and track radar emitters and communicate targeting information to an AGM-88 while the aircraft is in flight. That would reduce the targeting loop down from half an hour or more, to just seconds. But Ukraine can’t do this right now, so instead they’ve been using artillery and with great effect. Reports suggest that in some places Russia doesn’t have Zoopark-1 radar availability anymore because they’ve all been killed.",1689662888.0,1689646141.0,t3_151r1pz,t1_jse9lk6,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

It didn't come from the collapse of the pillar, because the pillar is still there.  Either the pillar moved and pulled the deck and then moved back again (which is not at all the way poorly engineered pillars fail), or the deck moved while the pillar stayed put (which is the way pillars are generally engineered to behave).

The obvious answer is that the bridge deck moved. If I had to guess, I would guess that it was ""hammered"" from below, by a shock wave moving upwards and outwards.

In the 90's the armenians won and got the karabaj region as an independent state controlled by them (this was a conflictive region from a long time ago). Azerbaijan reformed the military and with the help and protectorship of Turkey (that's why Russia never though in attacking Azerbaijan) they launched the 2º Karabaj war in 2020 and won. They got a little bit more territory and many concessions from the armenians but everyone knew it wouldn't stop there (and hasn't, lots of troubles after the war ended).

Meanwhile armenia summoned the CSTO in 2020 and no one helped them. They summoned again last year after Azerbaijan started shelling armenian cities, but with the same result.

In 2020 Russia deployed peacekeepers in the Karabaj region to ""garantee the agreements are fulfilled"" but they won't confront the Azerbaijanis and there are some reports of clashes between them.

Long story short Armenia is in an alliance that won't help them, with a guarantor that won't defend them, and in a likely war that they can't win.

[This can be relatively minor,](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1680848690443943937/photo/2) but you'd want a thorough analysis of the support structure to be sure.

That's because the people doing the work were (hopefully) doing their due diligence. You want to be damn sure that the support structure underneath was not compromised; showing any signs of buckling, cracking, or bowing depending on the type of bridge.

Secondly, Ukraine did this in the middle of the tourist season. Those tourists are now competing with avenues to get home through the coast highway along the Azov sea. That creates more opportunities for delays in supplies making it to the front. 

Lastly, say a meager 5% of the goods are transported by truck vs. train. Most likely small items that don't require train transport.

the thing with bridges is that the surface can also be a structural element.

**The Americans** declared that Russia would invade - when the President goes on TV and states that along with the approximate start date you know they are confident.  Less impressive is the fact that they expected Russia to win the conventional phase early and resistance would need to be guerilla style going forward.

**The Russians** also expected that they would win, that the Ukrainian military and political chiefs would either do nothing or actively collaborate.  Look at the response to the Wagner march - that in a nutshell is what they expected from the AFU.  Some light resistance, with a fair bit of negotiation between chiefs and most units standing aside while awaiting developments.

**The Ukrainians** themselves - and a good portion of Europe - did not expect the full scale invasion.  After all, the Russians didn't call up the reserves and weren't arrayed in echelon for the hammer blow.  And so Zelenskyy, Macron and others pooh-poohed the US insistence that war was coming and were actively trying to reassure potential investors it was not.

**All of these positions are reasonable**.  They all were based on known facts and past historical performance of the various parties.  None was completely correct.

As we now know, Ukraine is capable of remarkable resilience but the fact is they were a punching bag in 2014 and are lead by a former comedian who had abysmal levels of popular support pre-invasion.  The government and army was riddled with corruption (at least by Western standards) and a reasonable person could expect it to fall apart with a hard knock.

The Russian military is a strong force even today and as I've argued before, might have won this handily, but only if they took the necessary steps.  And that included doing all the things that the Ukrainians, French and others were looking for - putting their forces on active war footing, appointing a strong command structure who in turn would create a flexible and comprehensive plan that could respond to potential reverses and still win.

So, they used an older airframe (Su-27 I believe). This led to compromises which resulted in the Su-57 being 6-10 times more observable, in terms of distance, than the F-35. So, while the S-400 can detect an Su-57 at a distance of 96-160 miles, it can only detect an F-35 at 16 miles. Not than an F-35 needs to get that close, but at top speed the S-400 operator has at most 48s to identify and launch countermeasures against the F-35. Whereas an operator of the same system has 3 minutes and 50 seconds, to 6 minutes and 24 seconds to react to the Su-57.

I also believe that the Su-57 is only stealthy flying towards the radar, lateral and aft cross sections are much less stealthy.

So, basically, the USSR absolutely could have built a stealthy jet on par to the F-35 (presuming they could have stood up a microchip foundry on par with Western foundries) but we're talking Russia which is a big country with a disproportionately small economy (e.g., the US state of California has a GDP of more than twice that of Russia.)",False,1689602610.0,t3_151r1pz,t1_jsbdzpy,,2,4,0,4,1,0,

Yeonpyeong Island is only 10km out from the mainland so that is really bad if an accurate picture of NK shells. The North Koreans call their artillery ""the sea of fire"" maybe because they know the accuracy is horrible and the plan is just to carpet bomb everything in a general area flat.

Which is a problem for a Russia running low on massed artillery pieces and with worsening capability to hit Ukrainian artillery in counter battery fire.

This article doesn't give the answer but it is suggestive.

TL;DR: It *could* be a LOT of shells, like *millions* -- but North Korea will probably sell the oldest ammunition, and based on a 2010 artillery attack, its quality seems poor.

[From NPR, September 2022](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1121477374/north-korean-ammo-will-stretch-russias-supply-but-with-clear-limits-and-drawback)

> **North Korean ammo will stretch Russia's supply, but with clear limits and drawbacks**

> SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is apparently moving to sell millions of rockets and artillery shells — many of them likely from its old stock — to its Cold War ally Russia.

> The ammunitions North Korea reportedly intends to sell to Moscow are likely copies of Soviet-era weapons that can fit Russian launchers. But there are still questions over the quality of the supplies and how much they could actually help the Russian military.

> North Korea ""may represent the single biggest source of compatible legacy artillery ammunition outside of Russia, including domestic production facilities to further supplies,"" said Joseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

> Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said **both North and South Korea — split along the world's most heavily fortified border for more than 70 years — keep tens of millions of artillery shells each.  North Korea will likely sell older shells** that it wants to replace with newer ones for multiple rocket launch systems or sophisticated missiles in its front-line army bases, he said.

> But Bruce Bennett, a senior security expert at the California-based Rand Corporation, said most of the artillery rounds to be sent to Russia are likely to be ammunition for small arms, such as AK-47 rifles or machine guns.

> ""It's not millions of artillery shells and rockets — that's more than the likely consumption. It could be millions of small arms rounds,"" Bennett said.

>How good are North Korean weapons?

>According to an IISS assessment, North Korea has an estimated 20,000 artillery pieces including multiple rocket launchers in service, a number that Dempsey described as ""significantly more than any other country in the world.""

>But its old artillery systems, whose ammunitions will likely be supplied to Russia, **have a reputation for poor accuracy.**

Actually, its about the wholesale rejection of militaries murdering civillians in furtherance of political objectives which are nothing to do with them.

It's quite an important lesson we learned which led to the formation of the useless UN after WW2.
