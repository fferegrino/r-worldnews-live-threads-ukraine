Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 03 March 2023  


* Despite the war in Ukraine, Russian defence companies continue to showcase their products at major international arms fairs.  

* The Arena-E active protection system (APS), designed to improve the survivability of armoured vehicles, was displayed at a recent event.  

* Its promotional literature states that it ‘defeats the threats that are most dangerous for armoured vehicles…if you value your armour and crews you need Arena-E’.  

* There has been no evidence of Arena-E systems being installed on Russia’s own vehicles in Ukraine, where it has lost over 5,000 armoured vehicles.  

* This is likely due to Russian industry’s inability to manufacture high-tech systems at scale; a problem which is exacerbated by the effect of international sanctions.

Scholz mentioned the security guarantees while criticizing China for failing to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and calling on Chinese authorities to pressure Russia into withdrawing Russian forces from Ukraine. Scholz’s statements are consistent with reports of a proposed Ukraine-NATO defense pact that would provide enough arms to Ukraine to force Russia to the negotiation table, but would not offer Article V protection or obligate NATO states to deploy forces to Ukraine. ISW has recently assessed that such an agreement appears to reflect a desire to pressure Ukraine to accept a negotiated settlement on unfavorable terms, especially as Russian President Vladimir Putin is currently unlikely to compromise on his maximalist goals of demilitarization and de facto regime change in Ukraine.\[22\]

Residents of towns and cities in eastern and southern Ukraine have been pressured to accept Russian citizenship for their newborns, including deprived of free diapers and baby food. That reports Reuters.
For example, Natalia Lukina (42) from Kherson is said to have said: ,,We told (Russians) that the baby was born in Ukraine and is Ukrainian, not Russian. When we asked for diapers, the Russians said, ""If you come without a Russian birth certificate, we won't give you diapers.""
Most parents of small children, who had little income during the war, accepted free diapers from Russians, her partner Oleksii Markelov said. ""There wasn't a penny of money."" Reuters could not independently confirm their account.

According to Olena Klimenko, head of the Kherson regional registry office, many parents postponed visiting Russian-controlled registry offices during the occupation, and many registered their babies for Ukrainian citizenship once the occupation ended.

Even in the coming days it might not be so, Russia's winter offensive has shown to be completely laughable.

Once of which provides no major strategic value to Ukraine now.

Meanwhile, Russia is having drones and Russian separatists, **in their own country**, to deal with. Crimea and eastern regions are increasingly being bombed.

Russia started being cut off from the global economy. Ukraine would continue to get stronger, and Russia would continue to get weaker. The direction of the tide was set. Waves would still be coming in and out, but Ukraine would, eventually, drive the Russians out, I had and continue to have, zero doubt.



Already then, a year ago, the question for a lot of us outsiders became… then what? Ukrainians have their heads down and a job to do. They’re concentrated on winning, not on what happens after they’ve won. But they aren’t indifferent.



Does the war just sort of stall out at a lower level on a long front along the border with a no-man’s-land as wide as artillery range? Does Russia bow-out relatively gracefully? Does Ukraine continue degrading the Russian military to the point that it is virtually non-existent and Russia bows out un-gracefully?

The FDP politician Strack-Zimmermann, therefore, sees former Chancellor Merkel as partly responsible for Russia's war of aggression.  
>  
>The chairwoman of the Defense Committee in the Bundestag, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, has sharply criticized decisions made by ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel during her term in office. The FDP politician indirectly accuses the former chancellor of complicity in  Russia's war against Ukraine.  
>  
>The fact that the Ukrainians did not get into NATO ""was a big mistake made by the French and Angela Merkel at the time,"" said Strack-Zimmermann in an interview with RTL/ntv. At their summit in 2008, the NATO states promised Ukraine a speedy accession. The project failed because Merkel and then French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke out against it – out of consideration for Russia. Merkel defended her decision after the Russian invasion, and she stands by it, a spokeswoman said in April last year.

Why?  Because previously, first, because she was publicly opposed to funds going to strengthen Ukrainian military, saying that LGBT was “for peace, not murder,” back in 2014, only to delete the stance from website *after* last year’s invasion, saying Ukraine had been betrayed, but still not saying she supports major funds for the defense of Ukraine. Instead, talking about how aggressor countries profit from arm sales. 

Second, they see it as a slap in the face that the many thousands of women who help fellow citizens with bombs flying at them are wholly ignored. 

> Ukrainian journalist Oleksandr Rudomanov wrote, ""The head of the Volnovakha station, who died at the workplace because she was coordinating trains, is not the *woman of the year*. The conductor who died during the evacuation flights is not the *woman of the year*. And the LGBT activist is *woman of the year* according to TIME. Everything you need to know about these awards.""

> Economist Ilya Neskhodovsky expressed a similar opinion. He was indignant that the woman of the year was not a soldier, volunteer or doctor.

Ryan McBeth did a [short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qx-oBIMv_kA) with his take, that the reason Russia is so fixated on Bahkmut is that its one of the few places on the front where they can resupply easily.   There is a major road between Popasna and Bahkmut.  But most importantly the tracks from Popasna run to Horlivka, Donetsk and Mariupol.  

If the Ukrainians were to push west just 7 miles to Pokrovs'ke they would have the Popasna rail yard in range of 155mm howitzers (or even at the extreme range of 152mm howitzers) with Bahkmut as a logistical hub behind it and a good roads in between.",False,1677860538.0,t3_11gqojy,t1_jar9srq,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

That line about Putin’s greatest blunder is to highlight that Zelensky went from the position of entertaining a peace deal to no longer accepting anything but complete reclamation of Ukrainian soil because the Russians messed up so bad, not to highlight their invincibility. We know it not be true anymore. This author states this is an issue because to meet Zelensky’s new condition, it’s going to be one hell of a meat grinder esp. around Crimea. Now, to be clear, this is Ukraine’s war and they are allowed to set their own goalposts, but Gen. Milley has been on record saying it will be extremely difficult for UKR to achieve their stated political objectives. He even says that the hope is that the diplomats meet at the negotiating table. The US have also said (without trying to directly tell Ukraine what to do) that this most likely ends at the negotiating table. This might be an affront to people on this sub, but it shouldn’t be a surprise that this is the hope from many nation states. 

[Gen. Milley MSNBC interview. Worth a watch.](https://youtu.be/BTjvQsMhayw)

The author is simply stating that a negotiated settlement, given what UKR still has intact, as well as a negotiated peace with EU admission etc might be worth it instead of spilling more blood. People are free to agree or disagree with that sentiment, and only Ukraine can determine what is or isn’t ultimately worth it from their pov as the war goes on. 

Truth be told I think it is too early for any type of negotiations so it could be fairly said that this piece js a bit premature. We have yet to see how the UKR counter offensive plays out.

Russia's artillery is inaccurate and relies on quantity of shells raining down into an entire grid square, making it practically unsurvivable.  However, this soaks up shells at a horrendous rate.  Russian artillery is highly vulnerable to ""starvation"" of ammunition (where there is insufficient ammunition on hand to rain artillery down on an advance).  Ukraine set up and then exploited starvation conditions shaped by the introduction of HIMARS and a whipsaw of the Russian supply logistics - first trapping resources in Kherson while draining Kharkiv (where Russian defense was actually overrun) and then returning to Kherson (where Russians retreated to avoid being overrun once their supplies inevitably would have run out).  

Since then, the front has collapsed significantly in length, largely along natural barriers to rapid advance. Having switched from offense to defense along the majority of the front (except a few positions of tactical significance) Russia can also exploit the defender's advantage.    Russia has adapted its artillery supply to a longer tail and staffed the front with reinforcements.  But they need time to get trained up and overall Russia is losing resources at an unsustainable rate.

Ukraine on the other hand needs to build up the attacker's advantage of overwhelming force and this also takes time, and they need training on all the new equipment.   Weather is inconvenient for both sides.

Second: After the Kharkiv counter offensive, Russia launched ""partial"" mobilization in Russia, forcing young Russian men who up until that point had refused to sign contracts with the Russian army. This allowed Russia to solve one of the key issues that led to the kharkiv debacle, which was a huge manpower shortage. They started to throw men, many of which were poorly equipped and poorly trained into the frontline in order to hold the  Ukrainian counter offensive. Poorly trained conscripts may be poor soldiers for offense, but when in defensive operations supported by artillery can hold a line quite effectively. 

Third: This mobilization wave also allowed Russia to start training new divisions in Belarus, where their presence creates a dilemma for Ukraine, where they must maintain sizeable forces in the Northern border with Belarus or risk being caught off guard again by another invasion through Belarus.

There was also the fact of weather, the Ukrainian counter offensive in Kharkiv launched just as the rainy season in Ukraine was about to start, so by the time got to the Lyman and started knocking on the door of Kreminna, they effectively got bogged down in the mud unable to push further due to logistical issues.

The city is flattened anyways there's no real value to it and it's not particularly well situated.  But it's been the focus of Russia since the dual pincer move from Izyum.  Don't tell Russia their northern pincer is gone though because they've been throwing everything they can at the southern one for 6-9 months and have lost 10's of thousands of men trying to make it happen.

I think Russia caught themselves in a propaganda trap where they spent so much time talking about the importance of Bakmut that it had to eventually be taken. 

From Ukraine's perspective they probably felt that Russia were losing so much taking it that it was worth holding for the attritional value. 

Its overall strategic value looks to be approaching nil to me, it might have had value while the Kharkiv axis to the north was in play for Russia but without that it can't really affect much and the lines to the west of it are likely well fortified.",False,1677867137.0,t3_11gqojy,t1_jas6j43,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

da910feb566a2220ae48e74ed2f253ab,11gqojy,jasejoq,"Here’s how I look at it as someone with no real expertise but who has been following and trying to listen to experts. First, if this is a victory for RU, are they creating a breakthrough that they can exploit and can they scale the Bakhmut strategy to win the war? The evidence says no. There is some indication that RU MOD units are being structured more like Wagner units, but it’s clear from the offensive overall and even in Bakhmut that they can’t generate real momentum to exploit even if they can grind cities to dust and move forward at huge cost. Second, even if the losses are somehow sustainable on paper for RU, the effect it has on offensive capacity and vulnerability to counterattack is the real problem. RU is rapidly expending combat power for minimal gains, then replenishing units which takes time and typically those reconstituted are less not more effective than they were before. This necessity to reconstitute created windows for UA to seize momentum, and the degradation of combat power makes RU offensives less powerful, not more powerful over time. Meanwhile UA has been building combat power and war gaming with its Allies. Next, it’s important to keep remembering that every army loses battles and makes mistakes in a war. Arguing about whether everything that happens in Bakhmut is what UA wants is I think unnecessary cope and is probably not true. Some things for sure went wrong, but overall I do think we see these two Armies learning and managing things that go wrong in very different ways. In WW2 the Allies had tremendous losses and blunders in the early war but they learned, adapted, and crucially they coordinated effectively. The Axis meanwhile fell into their own faulty assumptions and grand delusions, they constantly restructured rigid command structures, had their political leaders dictating military matters, and did not collaborate well with Allies. Though the scale is much different here I think it’s helpful to think about “the war” more in these dynamic terms. I think the real problem at this point is we don’t really know what winning the war means. And I think that makes these battles feel like the whole war sometimes even though they are not. I do think that RU going on offense now actually helps UA as others have said, vs RU staying on defense until after UA’s next push. But I don’t think we can evaluate Bakhmut until the next phase plays out, unless Bakhmut turns into a major breakthrough for RU (unlikely). After the next stage we may have a better sense of if and how Bakhmut was consequential, and hopefully we will have an end of the war in sight on terms that are satisfactory to UA.",False,1677869422.0,t3_11gqojy,t1_jas6j43,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

They are close to friendly lines in Donetsk and Luhansk, which means the supply chains and support are pretty intact, as opposed to areas that the Russians have taken, but not yet been able to build the necessary logistical aids for.  Any artillery assets used will be in less-exposed territory with better anti-air protection and fortifications to withstand counter-battery fire, and air assets will have minimal exposure to Ukrainian anti-air assets, which have decimated  the ranks of the Russian air forces.   

They can't battle on open ground, since the armor and mechanized infantry units that would be best suited to there have been eroded, thanks to a proliferation of anti-armor weaponry, accurate artillery along with drone-assisted targeting, and a significant operational deficiency in combined arms tactical planning, coordination, maneuver, execution and support.  Basically, this means that the Russians' best bet on making any progress is a situation such as what they have in Bakhmut.

Ukraine has been paying a bloody cost for their defense of the city, that's for certain.  Urban warfare is messy, and incredibly difficult.  But every body, piece of equipment and supplies the Russians spend towards taking Bakhmut is something that can't be used to reinforce other positions in the theater of operations, let alone mount an offensive.  Every day that is spent in Bakhmut is one more day to get fresh, Western-trained troops back into the country and towards the front, and more time to get new NATO and US-supplied equipment on Ukrainian lands and into action.

The EU is directly bordering Ukraine, so has dealt with far more in terms of refugees and humanitarian support. Also some weapons. It has also supplied what it is well tailored to supply.

>""The deceased was one of the creators of the Sputnik V vaccine, Andrei Botikov, born in 1974,"" the source said.

>According to Yulia Ivanova, senior assistant to the head of the capital's head office of the Investigative Committee , with reference to the data of the investigation , the day before, in an apartment on Rogova Street, a 29-year-old young man quarreled with the owner and strangled him with a belt. The identity of the deceased is not specified.

>During the interrogation, the detainee admitted his guilt, he was charged. The man has already been prosecuted for a serious crime, a source told RIA Novosti.

This can safely and plainly be ruled out. A proper defense pact would mean that signatories like Germany would have to basically declare war on Russia once they attacked Ukraine (again), and we're absolutely not willing to do that.

What Scholz actually means – and I think this has been reported by WSJ a few days ago – is a security agreement to provide Ukraine with shittons of modern weapons in order to allow for them to defend against Russia in case they break the (for Ukraine) unfavorable peace agreement, that has not been negotiated yet.

This is also delusionary, because there is no such equipment. It simply can't be done. We went out of our ways to show the world how much we are struggling to deliver two battalions worth of modern western tanks to Ukraine.

Sadly, the rest of the Western world was able to enjoy those fruits for their people, while the U.S. chose defense over spending on items that directly help the people, like healthcare, universal pre-k, paid time off, etc. I do wonder if Europeans had kept up their own defense spending, though of course reduced, would the U.S. have been able to not spend as much on defense in order to *also* take care of its people as the rest of the advanced economy world seems to do. It seems, as an American, that our sacrifice of any spending on helping our people over defense spending is because everyone else doesn't want the responsibility, while blaming the U.S. for being a hegemonic power at the same time as hiding behind the skirts of the U.S. defense spending and industry. It was, and has been, a bit bullshit. 

Even now, this is an existential war of democracy v. autocracy and imperialism, yet also, a very European war. Thank God the Germans have changed, as they used to be the most anti-war out of all those countries except for maybe Italy (also fueled by lots of Russian money going back to Berlusconi, who is close to Putin), while also having the protection of U.S. troops and bases still in their country. 

It is, very much so and has been for years before Trump, a big issue that there are multiple, large countries within the EU that just refused, for well over a decade and a half, to get their defense spending to 2%. What Trump said was, in an essence, right. He tapped into a long running frustration in the American public at these very large, successful countries not taking their defense spending commitments seriously while lecturing the U.S. constantly on their own defense spending while knowing they have U.S. bases and U.S. supplies that would protect them as a guarantee if anything should happen. 

Europeans do need to step their fucking game up, or they're only going to help, again, for a person like Trump to rise. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't speak down to Americans at rights and privileges for healthcare, childcare, education rights while cutting your military funding to the point your soldiers are using broomsticks as rifles for training, then a situation that proves the folly of your words comes up and you're back to relying on the U.S., a non-European country, to do the vast majority of the work for you through arms and direct funds. I understand the nuances that led to this moment, yet a great chunk of the American populace does not. They just see Europeans who helped to create the mess of the world (colonization, impressment, divisions of land in faraway, non-European countries, dividing up people by ethnicity and tribes that provoked tribal conflict, e.g. Rwanda, the entire M.E. as a result of the Balfour declaration and Sikes-Pikot agreement, Iran with the coup instigated by the UK using the US as useful idiots, the list goes on) we live in acting as if they're the best, most civilized people in the entire world because they rose from the ashes of WWII and the Cold War... a good chunk of people in the middle, on the far left and definitely on the right are kind of sick of it here. 

I almost forgot to mention, but the Libya intervention was another great example. The Europeans most definitely wanted to stop Gaddhafi as well. They had to rely on the U.S. for most of the heavy lifting, simply because we have the military spending in investments to have the capabilities, while our allies did not. Obama expected Europeans, since they had a greater vested interest in Libya, especially having been a former European colony..., to do more to assist Libya following the initial military actions by NATO.

Here, people are convinced that anyone in higher government is corrupt and to be watched like a hawk. We're cynical as fuck, and if there was a war here, no one would be naive enough to imagine the Prime Minister didn't know soldiers are being sent to the meat-grinder.

And that was the same during Communism, extreme cynicism aimed at the Party leadership was the norm. Before that our tzars were German, one of them was responsible for two national catastrophes, another did a coup on our elected government and suspended our constitution, and because of that the last person in government you could think of as ""good"" was the tzar. Before that there was the Ottoman sultan, and if you're Romanian I shouldn't have to explain to you how trusted and revered he wasn't here. So we don't have a historical tradition of ""czar good, boyars bad"" for at least 700 years, and I have never heard anything suggesting it existed before that. On the contrary, stuff like the high literacy and high value of critical thinking in the Bulgarian state and church since 856 (as a way to counter Byzantine influence) was a factor against such sheeplike reverence of the tzar. It's not a coincidence one of the first major heretical movements in Europe started here (the bogomils) and that they preached with huge success against the power of the tzars.

Interestingly, the Romanians I met had similar attitude towards their government to Bulgarians, that the ""big boss"" was always a corrupt and self-serving piece of shit and not to be trusted or revered. As to Serbians, they like machismo, strongmen etc, but they don't have a culture of dumping responsibility on the boyars.

Basically you're describing the same thing, just mentioning revenue sources. You can increases taxes and do both, but at the same time can't be spending what we are in defense because allies aren't spending their part, so we have to be able to be flexible and augment in any conflict accordingly that would include allies. 

The conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated this exceedingly so. The situation with the Panzer 2s is showing how much European countries have skipped on their own military budgets, to the point they don't have all the tanks they essentially were trying to commit. And we all knows munitions production is a huge problem rn, and the U.S. has a heavy military industrial complex, yet even then we can't produce the munitions currently to replace the stock and keep up with Ukraine's needs as it now stands without years of backlogs.
