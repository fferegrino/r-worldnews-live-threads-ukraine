Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 30 August 2022


- From early on 29 August 2022, several brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply. It is not yet possible to confirm the extent of Ukrainian advances.

- However, since the start of August, Russia has made significant efforts to reinforce its force on the western bank of the Dnipro River around Kherson. The Southern Military District's (SMD) 49th Combined Arms Army has highly likely been augmented with components of the Eastern Military District's (EMD) 35th Combined Arms Army. Most of the units around Kherson are likely under-manned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines by ferry and pontoon bridges across the Dnipro.

- This integration of SMD and EMD units suggests a significant reorganisation of Russia's force in Ukraine. There is a realistic possibility that Russia has moved to rationalise the several, semi-independent, operational commands which contributed to its poor performance early in the invasion. If Ukraine succeeds in undertaking sustained offensive operations, the cohesion of this untested structure will likely be a key factor in the sustainability of Russian defences in the south.",False,1661840088.0,t3_x1949c,t3_x1949c,,0,64,0,64,0,0,

Day 188 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the day started with shelling, and an awful one. There was no missile strike the previous night at all, but instead they shelled us at 10am, and they specifically aimed to kill as many civilians as they can. They shelled a park and a yard beside one of the apartment buildings. They killed 5 people and injured around 7 more. There were no military targets anywhere nearby; one of the shells literally destroyed a toilet.

Then we were shelled again at 3pm, again they aimed at residential districts. They shelled an apartment building in Northern Saltivka, thankfully there were no casualties, but that’s most likely because there are barely any people left in that district, it’s completely destroyed from shelling early in the war, so it became basically abandoned. 

Then we were shelled *again,* at 11:15pm, this time with cluster munitions, we don’t know what was targeted yet. Then at midnight they fired their missiles from Belgorod. There were 4 missiles in total, two directly hit a residential building in Kharkiv, but thankfully no people died, and only 2 were injured. 

The other 2 missiles malfunctioned and fell in Belgorod, as is tradition. One fell closer to the city and another closer to the border. It’s always nice seeing Russia bomb itself, especially after they kept saying that we are shelling our own cities since the start of the war. Now they are the ones literally bombing their own cities, so they were just projecting all along.

Ukraine pressed forward with an offensive in the country’s south on Tuesday, seeking to build on some initial gains after launching the assault to retake the Kherson region a day earlier.

Videos on social media showed explosions overnight throughout the city of Kherson. Russian state media reported that a number of buildings in Kakhovka had been destroyed. Ukrainian forces have seized at least one village to the northeast of Kherson, the regional capital, and were fighting hard for several others, according to Russian military bloggers closely connected to the Russian armed forces.

Ukraine’s strategy for the offensive was beginning to emerge Tuesday through reports from both sides. For weeks, Ukraine has focused on cutting Russian supply lines across the Dnipro river using U.S.-supplied long-range rockets to take out Russian logistics across the region. Ukrainian officials said they lacked the weaponry and manpower for a broad offensive.

Now, after destroying bridges and ammunition depots across the Kherson region, the Ukrainians have launched an assault focused on expanding a bridgehead eastward across the Inhulets river.

A Ukrainian officer in the region said Ukrainian units on the eastern bank of the Inhulets were pushing toward the Dnipro to the northeast of Kherson in an apparent attempt to divide Russian forces sandwiched between the two rivers.

“This is a planned slow operation to grind the enemy, saving the lives of our military and civilians,” Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, wrote on Telegram early Tuesday. “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about our military’s capture of one settlement an hour. But we don’t fight like that. And our means are limited.”

Ukrainian military officials said Tuesday that they had hit 13 Russian command centers across the Kherson region, as well as a Russian crossing of the Dnipro near the village of Lvove. Military officials advised residents of the region to stock up on food, water and medicine to prepare for the continuing assault.

Russian officials installed in occupied southern Ukraine by Russia initially denied there was any Ukrainian offensive. On Monday evening, the Russian Ministry of Defense said the attacks had failed and resulted in heavy losses for Ukraine. The ministry repeated the claim on Tuesday afternoon.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters Tuesday that the “special military operation,” the Kremlin’s euphemism for the war, was progressing “methodically” and according to plan. “All of its goals will be achieved,” he said.

But reports from Russian military bloggers suggested that Ukraine made breakthroughs to the northeast of Kherson, the regional capital, after bombarding the towns of Beryslav and Nova Kakhovka.

The bloggers said Ukrainian forces had broken through Russian lines, taking control of the village of Sukhiy Stavok. They said Russia repulsed assaults elsewhere, but fierce fighting was continuing for villages along the Inhulets river as Ukraine sought to expand a bridgehead on its eastern bank.

Russian state news agencies reported Tuesday morning that air defense systems in Kherson were repelling Ukrainian missile attacks.

Conflicting reports also emerged from Russian officials in the region. The Russian-installed head of the Kakhovka district told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Monday that the city wasn’t being evacuated. But he said workers were sent home, as shelling caused substantial damage to various parts of the city, and that some of it had been left without electricity and gas.

Igor Girkin, a former Russian intelligence officer who led a Russian-backed uprising in eastern Ukraine in 2014 under the nom de guerre of Igor Strelkov, posted on Telegram that around 5 a.m. on Tuesday Ukrainians “launched powerful missile attacks on the bridge and crossings in Kherson.”

For the last several days, Kirill Stremousov, one of the most visible Ukrainian political figures to have collaborated with the Russians in Kherson, has posted on Telegram from a new location that appears from the buildings in the background to be in the Russian city of Voronezh, according to an open-source intelligence researcher.

The British Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Ukrainian offensive in the south had forced Moscow to reorganize its troops, including redeploying forces to the south who had been in the eastern Donbas area.

“Most of the units around Kherson are likely undermanned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines by ferry and pontoon bridges across the Dnipro,” the ministry wrote on Twitter, adding that a Ukrainian offense would test the cohesion of the reorganized Russian units.

In his nightly address late Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wouldn’t give any information on the military situation. “The occupiers should know: We will drive them to the border,” he said.

Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to shell Ukrainian-held areas across the country. In Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast, eight rounds of artillery slammed into the center of the city on Tuesday morning, killing at least eight civilians, according to the Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Two of the strikes hit near a preschool and a multistory residential building.

Twenty-four people were injured and two killed in a strike Monday on Mykolaiv, near the southern front line, according to the governor. Two were killed in the Donetsk region, in the east. The city of Zaporizhzhia, in the southeast, was hit by a rocket, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the regional governor.

In Donetsk, a Russian-installed official said Russian forces had repelled a Ukrainian counteroffensive near the village of Kodema.",False,1661870680.0,t3_x1949c,t3_x1949c,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

Jade Helm was an exercise meant to collect some real-world data on a new kind of warfare that military strategists were developing with Ukraine defending against Russia specifically in mind. Resistance Operating Concept.


In 2015, US soldiers dressed like civilians and took civilian busses and trains and rental cars instead of jeeps and trucks to muster strike groups, and the pentagon wanted to know how long that would take and if it was even feasible. There’s a lot more that goes in to R.O.C., but blending large-ish numbers of troops in with the civilian population and using civilian transportation infrastructure is a key element. Pre-staging everything that these strike-groups would need once they got there is another.



Maybe it’s not a surprise that conspiracy theorists jumped all over that one. It is a scary idea. Some random people get off a bus and wander in to basement one minute, and the next minute squads of armed soldiers are appearing in your streets.



In 2013, when Russia grabbed Crimea, a whole wing of the pentagon went in to planning mode. How could Ukraine beat much larger Russia? They took everything they knew, from 20 years in Afghanistan, from the OSS work in Yugoslavia, from the Winter War in Finland… and they cooked up this, this that we’re seeing now in Ukraine. “Partisans”.



So far they have mostly been conducting harassing operations well behind the lines, normal commando stuff. But they could play an even bigger role operating closer to the front in support of a Ukrainian advance. Russians manning their defensive positions around Kherson might want to keep their heads on a swivel and watch out for squads of Ukrainian soldiers mysteriously materializing out of basements behind them.",False,1661869840.0,t3_x1949c,t3_x1949c,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

The majority of Russian troops escape alive, but a decent chunk of equipment is either destroyed or captured(albeit not all of it, guarantee the more expensive stuff already has a ticket for a ferry, and Ukraine probably can't hit all of them yet).

Russia passes some referendum reforming the Taurida Governornate or something, basically annexing all the land between the Dneiper and Donetsk.

Russia pushes a bit further into Donetsk while Ukraine is busy and after they realize Kherson is a lost cause, but nothing major. They also might push slightly further north towards Zaporzhia city near that bend in the river.

(6/8) This integration of SMD and EMD units suggests a significant reorganisation of Russia’s force in Ukraine.

(7/8) There is a realistic possibility that Russia has moved to rationalise the several, semi-independent, operational commands which contributed to its poor performance early in the invasion.

Their army, such as it is, has never had a reason to do any sort of offensive in its entire existence up to this point.

There's bound to be rookie mistakes is what I'm saying.

The other thing is that one of the biggest things its needed help and outside supply for is communications equipment. Radios, signals, coordination means...without these very basic fundamentals and even more importantly the institutional skill to use them in an offensive context an army will not get very far.

Need proof? Look at Russia. The Ukrainian army derived from the same soviet model that the Russians do until recently and the Russians have been rightly slandered for their shitty communications equipment and sloppy communications practices.

This is why a bunch of US aid packages had ""communications gear"" listed amongst them.

I think Ukraine is set to do good work in Kherson with the launch of this offensive but do not be overly alarmed by reports of problems that they are facing.

The east is most valuable from a resource perspective. But most of the east that is Russian-controlled could be covered by long range fires from within Russia.   If Ukraine takes it back, Russians can lob shells and missiles from inside Russia, with units parked in school playgrounds and parking lots of residential buildings... and just petulantly make life hell for anyone in that region.   With practically unlimited resupply along relatively efficient and partisan-free routes.

Thus, Ukraine will not be able to fully exploit the territory if it ""takes it back"".   

Also, it is within range of Russian-based air defences etc, so it will be militarily most difficult to conquer. 

Conversely, if Ukraine leaves the east to be occupied, it still can't exploit the resources... but ties Russian forces down in WW1 type trench defense.  In this case, Russia has to (a) expend effort to feed and supply its troops there, (b) continuously recruit to refill casualties (c) expose itself, equipment and command to pretty much unlimited return fire, and ultimately (d) fight a version of Afghanistan, but in the winter against troops armed like you and insurgents who talk like you and look like you.   

The same is not true in the south.  If Ukraine can recover Kherson and thrust across the ""land-bridge"", then they have a serious shot at Crimea.  With Moscva out of the picture, and HARM to take out air-defence radars, the shore flank is seriously exposed.  There are land routes that can't be covered from Russia proper (especially in the winter), and routes of resupply are narrow, static, and precisely identifiable.   Sebastopol cannot fall without dealing a mortal blow to Russian pride, and so it *must* be defended.  While militarily more difficult to assault by tank and artillery, laying siege is still distinctly possible if the bridge can be destroyed and the ports can be hit from far away.  Russia would be forced to resupply from air, and this would be very very risky with Ukraine's own air-capacity.",False,1661869343.0,t3_x1949c,t1_imdvj6h,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

Of course if resources allow it, getting both Kherson and Melitopol would be better than just one, but economy of forces might dictate against that for now.

The main possibilities right now are:

Kherson (the area, not only the city) is the main effort, and cutting the russians from access to the Dnieper crossings is the target.  If successful This means some 10-20+k russians encircled. This might prove enough of a blow to realistically knock out the russians.

Kerson is a  \*feint\* (i know, i know) and the main effort would soon come along aTomak-Bedriansk (kind of ambitious) or more likely Tomak-Melitopol axis.

If successful, this makes the entire russian southern front dependent of supplying and reinforcing from Crimea, and if UA reaches the Azov sea, it brings the Kerch AA sites in HARM range, while giving the possibility to interdict supplies coming from Crimea.

Since it would be a big area, unless UA clears Kherson and north of the Dnieper quickly, it wouldn't be such a blow to the russians in the short term.

I'd say only after Kherson is clear, UA might move on Melitopol, but it would be the most obvious directions, even for russia. and it would require a lot of logistical effort and it might take some time, redeploying the troops across the Dnieper.

Did any of your economists tell you that?

Those projections were made with best case scenario in mind, not as a certainty.

The moment China threw its tantrum around Taiwan last month was the moment the west decided maybe we have to put China in its place. That's when that projection that China will overgrow America's economy was thrown out the window.

People like you are in for a rough, and I mean fucking rough, awakening. You will be in a world where Ruzzia is a minor regional power, if it will even be called a power at that point, and China is going to be on a downward trend, not upward.

I mean, those projections are bullshit anyway, considering China's population is on a downward trend, and the decrease in their population is severe, I think this year was the second or third they had a negative growth.

To fertilize their fields
Because the wheat and flowers
Needed much more yield.

They thought to steal some steel
And repopulate the land
But never counted on
Zelensky - he's the man.

First came the airport trap
Which saved our old Kyiv
And then defense in depth
Held the invaders dead.

They ravaged Azov plant
And Bucha and the rest
Lobbed artillery and missiles
Put Ukraine to the test.

But Maidan is still alive
The Ghost in the skies
The people held the lines
They knew they would be fine.

The world woke up, remembered...
And rallied to their cry
They would not stand alone
Beneath the blue and gold.

Saint Javelin protects us
HIMARS precise and true
Repels the rashist forces
The victory pursued.

And many years from now
As the flag flies once again
From Mariupol to Crimea
We will all think back to then.

If you were a former soldier, a member of a local vets group and then the threat of invasion begins, you start preparing with your brothers and sisters.

Compound this with we know Ukraine prepared many caches and other things to assist partisans and resistance in her territories and you get the sort of brutally effective partisan activity we've been seeing in Kherson now and in many regions like Melitopol since the start of the war.

It doesn't take much to brush off old soldier skills and then apply them with local knowledge. And I'm pretty sure many in Kherson will have been itching for a fight after it was flipped by traitors.

No doubt when mounting a major offensive for the first time there will be mistakes made but since 2014 the Ukraine military has been massively improved. Various NATO missions trained over 150,000 Ukrainian soldiers since then and their army re-modelled itself as a western style force.

Meanwhile it's clear the last 20 years of trying to improve the Russian army got lost in the same pit of corruption, apathy and incompetence as always. However judging by their performance against an enemy with much greater resources it seems like Ukraine actually did drastically improve its army. I know that not all of those trained are still in the army and sadly a fair number have now died in combat no doubt but those NATO training courses, which were 9 months in length, gave the Ukrainian army access to a base of experience that the Russian army has never had and wouldn't have listened too even if it was offered.

They weren't intelligent like Ukraine. They don't even have their own water supply, most of their water comes from Kherson.

That's why it was such a priority for the Russian Military, Crimea has complete water flow for the first time since Russia invaded it.

Taking Kherson shuts off the taps to Crimea which is already going to be a significant loss for them.

Plus, the main thing is that any invasion of Crimea will be a massive propaganda loss for Russia on its own.

Once they get within HIMARS range of Sevastopol, what's left of the Black Sea Fleet is going up in smoke.

UK/US/Israeli at the top. Its basically them first and everyone else in regards to tactics, coordination, equipment, and training. They are the gold standard.

I am not ready to write off all of Russias special operator divisions simply because the Russian military at large has embarrased itself to some degree in Ukraine. They retain a reputation around the world, including among western special operators, but this is not the same as being equals. To be clear, I am ONLY speaking about Spetznaz/GRU. However, their efficacy has been really called into question especially when examining what is known about their track record which is really limited to inside Russia and former USSR nations and Syria. Not exactly top shelf competition.

It seems to me that Russia is attempting to fight a conventional war against an opponent that is doing their level best to avoid being drawn into conventional engagements on Russian terms. Russia thought their massive advantages in numbers combined with their airforce and naval support would be all that was required to win this war.

Ukraine has put on a master class in territorial defense against an overwhelmingly larger opponent. When I see what they do, I cannot help but see mold being very much in the shape of a western military. They could not have done it without the weapons provided for them from the best weapon designers in the world. We saw first hand how effective they were, and how quickly they turned that numbers advantage into not an advantage at all. So lets give the weapons and Ukraine some credit for really making the Russians look bad in some crucial spots.

However, Russia still took quite a bit of Ukraine, and we are all watching to see if Ukraine can take it back. The rent in Ukraine for Russians has been EXTREMELY high and that was before the looming collapse of supply lines and morale brought on by this most recent phase. Having 10X the armor of your smaller opponent means nothing if you cannot maintain and supply the units. This was all made possible by the resolve and toughness of Ukrainians, the ability to learn a new doctrine sometimes on the fly, and the support they have received from the rest of the world.",False,1661892570.0,t3_x1949c,t1_imffgwd,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

 >Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling (, Norwegian: [ˈvɪ̂dkʉn ˈkvɪ̂slɪŋ] (listen); 18 July 1887 – 24 October 1945) was a Norwegian military officer, politician and Nazi collaborator who nominally headed the government of Norway during the country's occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. He first came to international prominence as a close collaborator of the explorer Fridtjof Nansen, and through organising humanitarian relief during the Russian famine of 1921 in Povolzhye. He was posted as a Norwegian diplomat to the Soviet Union and for some time also managed British diplomatic affairs there.

However; Ukraine looks to be conducting a classic penetration to the front with the intent to split russian forces and then use their reserve to exploit that penetration…,but it is their tactical reserve for this particular operation they will be using not their strategic reserve and so far they are using pretty standard NATO doctrine.

The front is huge and Kherson is not the only offensive or defensive operation going. A stalled offensive will not likely collapse Ukraine lines because the Ukrainians can always fall back to previous defensive positions and russia just lacks the resources on that side of the Dniper to exploit a stalled Ukrainian offensive. russian lines could collapse due to geography but that would be a tactical collapse in a pocket or salient rather than an army collapse.

Whereas some command post along a trench line in some stand of trees or in some random house in a village doesn't have a bunch of people around to point cell phones at it if it gets hit.

There's this and quite a few more. Estimates have come from Ukrainian and Mariupol officials themselves.  

I only say I don't think it's quite that high yet because outside of that 1 tweet. I have not found much other information to suggest it has reached that high yet. I tend to wait for official numbers or official statements prior to listening to what others have suggested. 

If an article came out tomorrow from Mariupol or Ukrainian officials to back that up, or figures near it. Absolutely I would believe it.

Under martial law, collaboration is any aid, assistance, service, sale, favor, or comfort to the enemy.  Literally everyone is out of a job.  No one is allowed to do anything with the Russians.  They’re not even allowed to use the rubles.  Prostitutes don’t get a special carve out if the cable guy, the taxi driver, the shopkeeper, the estate agent, the electrician, the roofer can’t.

The military has repeatedly asked the Melitopol residents to leave. The military aids them in getting out.  The local paper publishes the number to call to get out.  There’s no reason why the prostitutes get to stay and work,  but if a teacher does, bc she would not be implementing UA’s curriculum, she’s a collaborator while giving a blow job is not.  

Any and all help to occupiers is collaboration under martial law.  If it prohibits works, then you’re instructed to leave. There’s no exceptions outside emergency services.  If can’t live without profiting from the occupiers, the choice is leave or collaborate.  This has been explained to the residents ad nauseam.  Only westerners who’ve never fought are arguing about it.  As if prostitutes should be allowed to earn wages from the occupiers, while every other merchant, business owner, etc has had to leave bc couldn’t continue without aiding the Russians. 

Anyone simply in the company of occupiers is under suspicion of collaboration.

By the time the US announced they would be giving HIMARS to Ukraine the soldiers were already trained and they were in Ukraine days later, that also obviously was decided and set in motion months beforehand. Lockheed Martin reported[ increased profits back in June and cited HIMARS systems and rockets](https://www.newsweek.com/lockheed-martin-sees-spike-demand-himars-used-ukraine-1727723#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%27s%20second%2Dquarter%20report,for%20the%20boost%20in%20sales.) as being a major driver in that divisions profitability. So who knows just how far Lockheed Martin has scaled up production by now, they've had a fair bit of lead time to ramp up.

And you can not necessarily take the numbers from those types of press releases at face value, they are playing the information war game the same as Russia. For instance it has quietly leaked out here or there that the US has sent hundreds of M113 armored personnel carriers to Ukraine yet the only official mention on a donation list is for 50 medevac versions that were talked about a few weeks ago. Meanwhile videos from almost 4 months ago show [US maintainers getting M113's ready for transport to Ukraine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp4q2XXiuK8) Those were never mentioned in any of those donation lists. The US and other donors have said many times that they do not disclose all types of aid and that the list does not include all aid given.

So although obviously there is some upper limit in the thousands that Ukraine might have been given who knows how high the production rate has gotten, when it got there or how much it might be able to grow further in the coming months.
