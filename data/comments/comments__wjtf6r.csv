Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 9 August 2022
 

- Over the weekend, Russia has continued to focus efforts on reinforcing defences in southern Ukraine. Despite the shift in effort, Russia has maintained attacks on Ukrainian positions in Donetsk oblast.

- Over the last 30 days, Russia's assault towards the town of Bakhmut has been its most successful axis in the Donbas; however, Russia has only managed to advance about 10km during this time.

- In other Donbas sectors where Russia was attempting to break through, its forces have not gained more than 3km during this 30 day period; almost certainly significantly less than planned. Despite its continued heavy use of artillery in these areas, Russia has not been able to generate capable combat infantry in sufficient numbers to secure more substantial advances.

Day 167 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was actually a pretty quiet day, there was no shelling at all, and missiles from yesterday didn’t hit anything important. The targets were actually very weird and I don’t know what produced that long explosion sound. They hit a hotel-restaurant complex and a small private medical lab. Did they think it was one of those “mutant soldier producing bio labs” they were talking about earlier?

Weirdly enough there was no missile strike today yet, even though you would think they would seek immediate revenge for blowing up their airbase in Crimea. But for some reason there was no response yet, and it’s already almost 4am, maybe they won’t fire their missiles today? Probably not, but who knows, they did fire them at 4:45am just a couple of days ago.

It was also very funny seeing them say that there are no casualties and that not a single aircraft was damaged, and also that there was no missile strike on their airbase. They are just so incompetent that they completely destroyed it themselves, going as far as doing a simultaneous enormous explosions in two different places 500-1000m apart. Those explosions destroyed buildings within 1km, and yet somehow there were no casualties and no aircraft were even damaged?

Of course it’s already debunked with footage from the airbase popping up with destroyed planes, but why make such outrageous claims at all? They can’t hide anything anyway and we will see the full extent of destruction once satellite photos get released. I don’t think Russians from Crimea believe them either, as there is already a big traffic jam on the Kerch strait bridge going into Russia.
 
I wonder what was used in the strike, if they were missiles then some photos with their fragments should pop up, though maybe not. After all Russian version is that they are so bad at handling explosives that they blew up their airbase themselves, so showing any sign pointing to it not being their own doing would go against their own narrative.

>
>Even those 39 cases are now being scrutinized by war crimes investigators. They include a seemingly healthy 34-year old mother who died of a heart attack while sheltering from bombardments in a basement with her three young children, who remained trapped alongside their dead mother for days, and an elderly woman living alone with her sister who died shortly after her sister was shot by Russian troops — deaths that hardly could be considered natural.
>
>That it has taken more than four months to account for 32 days’ worth of killing underscores the horrific circumstances officials encountered when the Russians troops left. Bodies were strewn unattended around the streets, stuffed into wells or abandoned deep in the forest. Electricity and internet service had been cut, meaning the earliest documented evidence had to be written by hand, Skoryk-Shkarivska said.
>
>Identifying all of the bodies proved impossible. Some 50 corpses remain unidentified or unclaimed by relatives, Skoryk-Shkarivska said, adding that city officials nonetheless decided to announce their findings because the final tally, and complete identities, likely will never be known.

As a result of the landing, tram rails and an electric pole were damaged in the Industrial district, due to which the district was cut off.

Another arrival at a two-story building near the Ring Road. The facade, the roof are mutilated, the war is stamped out. There is no information about the victims.

📍Dnipropetrovsk region

the Russian army covered two districts with fire - Nikopolskyi and Synelnikivskyi.

At night, Nikopol was fired three times from ""Hradiv"". 120 rockets flew into the city. Damaged residential buildings. Workshops, workshops, administrative premises, cars were mutilated at three enterprises. An employee of one of the enterprises was injured - a 46-year-old man was hospitalized with a fracture.

In the Synelniky district, the Velikomykhailiv community came under fire. There is destruction of housing. No casualties.

I want to talk about three in particular, and let's start with one that I think is an RT employee, or at least funded by RT and posting what I'll call 'soft' Russian propaganda. 

Her channel's name is Eli from Russia. I know Eli has her simps here. I don't care. Eli is pushing Russian propaganda. Some of you even think she's opposed to the war - she's not, she's promoting an agenda. Let's dive in:

I'm not trying to speak bad about her personally when I say this: She's a college dropout who runs a medium-sized YouTube channel, and also runs a Russian speaking club. That's her job. With whatever money she gets from that, she's able to rent an apartment in Moscow and has seemingly an endless budget to travel around Russia and internationally. This doesn't seem possible for someone with a channel her size. 

Coincidentally, she filmed in Siberia around the same time that the Russian government was pushing travel to Siberia. More recently, she travelled to Africa the same time as Lavrov's visit to Africa to strengthen relations. No, I'm not saying they travelled together. I'm saying it's weird that she's so in step with what the Russian government is doing. 

Look here at the questions she claims she was asked, and her answers to them. Note the very Russian misuse of 'the' in the question she was asked about the economy. More telling than that is her response. For months, the Russian government has been telling people, 'the dollar is weak! The ruble is strong!' and she makes some claims about that without providing evidence. See here: [https://youtu.be/pZvpOVp0ix8?t=399](https://youtu.be/pZvpOVp0ix8?t=399) and if you watch the rest of that video you'll see some whining about sanctions and how they unfairly affect her.   


You can also see it in this video: [https://youtu.be/\_0lql3prvnI](https://youtu.be/_0lql3prvnI)

She also made a video with Russian paratroopers shortly before the invasion. *How did she get access to the military?!* This video is now gone. She also had a video about helping Ukrainian refugees, which, in a sense she wasn't lying about, but they were families of Donbass separatists fighting in Ukraine. It's also gone, or at least I can't find it on her videos page. I imagine too many people saw through that and mentioned what was really happening in the comments.   


Somewhere in her video collection is a video showcasing the RT vending machine in an airport. Inside are shirts and hats that say 'foreign agent' and she giggles and encourages people to buy them if they travel to Russia.

Weird. 

Sorry, I can't find that video, and I don't have the patience to look for it again. It could be another deleted video. Suffice it to say that was when I stopped watching her videos. I unsubscribed when she interviewed a Russian propagandist and claimed he was just an American who lived in Russia working in journalism and geopolitics. 

Meet Tim: [https://youtu.be/aVk4SnZaUcE](https://youtu.be/aVk4SnZaUcE)

I challenge you to watch more than fifteen minutes of that. Really, try. You'll see that his employer is mentioned in the description, but she only added that after a *lot* of people recognized him and called her out. It took her about two months before the endless comments about it seemed to make her finally acknowledge the fact that he worked for RT.   


But.. you know what? She didn't mention it *the first time* she interviewed the guy either, here: [https://youtu.be/ntqjLWfP3Bg](https://youtu.be/ntqjLWfP3Bg)

I advise you not to even try watching that video. It's clear she doesn't want to be around the guy in either video - it really seems like interviewing him because she had to.   


And wait, there's more! Here's Eli being interviewed on Tim's Rumble channel. I don't know if Rumble links are allowed here, so I'll post it this way: [https://rumble](https://rumble) dot com slash v195cs2-full-interview-elina-bakunova-on-the-youth-reaction-to-the-special-operatio.html

She's also connected to RT employees on LinkedIn. Think about the big picture: her video editing is superb, she films with a drone, she travels all over Russia and the world, interviews RT employees, and even hires a cameraman for some of her videos. She does this while running a Russian speaking club and a medium-sized YouTube channel? No. Where is she getting her money from?  


I'm not going to make accusations. I also don't think I have to.   


I've already spent too much time talking about her. I'll talk about the other two I want to talk about another time, in another daily thread: 1420 and Inside Russia. P.S.

So then I just decided to Google the optical side of it. Apparently, a human eye can resolve things that take up about 1 arcminute of vision. An ATACMS is 4 meters long with a 500lb warhead, a HRIM-2 has a 500kg warhead so let's say at least 5m long?

It would be visible a maximum of 17km away. That's absolute maximum, of course. The beach seems to be about 8km away from Saky so in theory, the missile would be visible from the beach, but still just barely.

Of course, it's also traveling a few km a second. Let's just guess 3km/s (ICBM's are 6-8 km/s apparently). At just 8km away, that means every second, it would be shifting 21 degrees. So, a person who is already looking that direction, horizontally, would have like 4 seconds to potentially see a tiny speck falling, and it wouldn't even be full size or at the center of their vision till the end. And more people are probably looking towards the beach, and looking slightly downwards.

So I guess my initial disbelief that nobody would have noticed a missile on a ballistic trajectory coming down is probably unfounded?

(I thought Neptune was more likely, but it's also also 5m long and even if it's cruising at only 5m, the distance to the horizon would actually be about 8km, so people would have had a lot more chance to see it than any sort of ballistic missile.)",1660102537.0,1660101687.0,t3_wjtf6r,t3_wjtf6r,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Crimea would be a death trap for the Russians.

It's the successful Ukrainian resistance in the first few weeks of the war that changed the game completely.

I live in the Netherlands, which currently has the highest gas price in Europe, and therefore likely the world. We have high inflation like everyone else and the cost of living has gone up. But support for Russian sanctions is high. When looking at the discussions in prominent media and politics, there is no serious discussion about lifting or weakening sanctions in response to the economic downturn. The Netherlands stands behind Ukraine, unequivocally. 

Putin anticipated a quick win followed by harsh economic sanctions which would slowly degrade over time as popular support and attention would wane. Instead he got a long, drawn out conflict in which the Ukrainians have booked several high profile successes and ever increasing sanctions, with a likely irreversible strategic shift in energy policy from the EU that will lead to a complete ban on Russian fossil fuels after this winter.

One reason that the League of Nations failed was because it was perceived as the League of Victors (of WW1) and countries of a different persuasion either didn't join or were broadly ignored; ultimately countries who disagreed with it would just leave.  That, of course, led to WW2.

The United Nations was designed to avoid that fate by ensuring that all of the powers capable of waging significant war/ensuring peace had an equal voice, and it would therefore always be a forum in which they could talk even if they did not agree.

There's no doubt that the balance of world power has shifted since the formation of the UN and there are very legitimate discussions over how the Security Council can and should be reformed to reflect that.  For example, whether India should have a permanent seat.

From this perspective, even if it's correct that Russia has no legal right to the USSR's permanent seat, it's quite likely that they ought nevertheless to hold a permanent seat in their own right due to the significance of their capabilities in waging war and maintaining peace.  No doubt there will be people who disagree with that, but if the planet's largest country (by land area), controlling a commensurate share of the planet's resources and with one of the planet's largest stockpiles of nuclear warheads is not considered significant in this regard, I honestly don't know what is.

Therefore, Ukraine's objection is merely a procedural rather than a substantive one—and I just don't see that going anywhere.  At best, it will lead to an amendment of the UN charter that formally replaces the USSR with the Russian Federation (and that probably makes other changes at the same time, such as some provision for India).

edit: also on top of all that, if Ukraine is using western munitions to target the bridge, and it did do significant damage, there is a not 0 chance that if Russia made a big deal, the west would back down and stop giving long range munitions because the western countries supplying them with these long range weapons have made it clear not to target land in Russia, and while Crimea is de jure Ukrainian, Russia has had de facto control since 2014 and it's definitely a thin line Ukraine would be treading, given that the target would be a bridge civilians drive on.",1660057302.0,1660056800.0,t3_wjtf6r,t1_ijl3cdq,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

The difference being: Dumb Artillery shells that they have stockpiled in tens of millions are also very easy to manufacture (yes, even for Russia) and they will never run out of them. They also have lots and lots of artillery that is capable of firing them (now, yes most of that is in stock and in terrible condition, but we are talking sheer numbers)

It is very likely (based on proofs from the explosion sites) that they are not using stockpiles for smart missiles, they are using freshly made missiles with components made (and imported into russia...) after start of this war.

The problem is, Ukraine liberating Crimea with western help turns the annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine into a *political* boondoggle rather than a *strategic* boondoggle.

If Russia is forced to withdraw under those circumstances with its tail between its legs and under penalization by the world, we'll just see a repeat of the Treaty of Versailles. The dominant Russian narrative will be that Western countries unfairly ganged up on them and played dirty, just to spite them and deny them what is rightfully theirs because they are expansionist and anti-Russian.

Amnesty can condemn Russian warcrimes until they're blue in the face, that single report did so much damage they've lost all credibility as an organisation. 

Since it has been released we've learned that:

- Ukranian branch of Amnesty was not consulted or involved at all. Their objections to the report were wholly ignored. 
- Actual experts in that type of international law say that the report's conclusions are complete bogus. 
- Amnesty sourced at least some their ""evidence"" from detainees in filtration camps. The chances that they weren't coerced in some way is almost zero.
- The secretary of the organisation called the outraged people of an aggrieved nation ""trolls"".

That's even ignoring the multitude of issues with the report and the mentality behind it:

- There are no ""legitimate"" targets for Russia in Ukraine. 
- Ukraine does not posses the ability to instantly teleport their soldiers and equipment to the front line. They *have* to move through civilian areas. 
- It is absolutely ludicrous to expect a nation fighting a defensive war to not fight in residential areas. Schools and hospitals included. 
- The patently moronic idea that ""empty"" civilian buildings may also not be used to house troops or military equipment. 

And if you're really that obtuse, please remember:

- RUSSIA HAS SHOWN THAT THEY WILL STRIKE CIVILIAN TARGETS WITH OR WITHOUT ANY MILITARY PRESENCE SINCE DAY 1

There are some 40-odd aircraft visible, but over the whole airfield.  Only one of the explosions in video so far was a secondary, which could have been a plane, but more likely points to a munitions cache.  If dozens of planes were affected by fire in the area we'd see lots of secondaries in these 40-sec clips.  And if all the remaining explosions were targeting aircraft, there are only 4 or so adjacent aircraft in a spot in 4-5 spots in the photo.  You can count for yourself.  Each explosion being a precision strike in the middle of each of these groupings wouldn't take out half the planes depicted.  

And while you can rule out that kind of luck, you can also rule out that kind of intention.  Destroying a plane with a Toschka 200km away is simply not as big an objective, nor is it guaranteed to still be there by the time the missile strikes.  Munitions and fuel depots are static targets and the only ones Ukraine can expend such damaging missiles on right now.

Just like the fact we only found out about them receiving HARM anti radar missiles after Russia showed a piece of debris off from one and the US went ""ya that's ours, we gave them some.""

Any time you see an announcement there is a reason behind what they said and why they're saying it right now. Sometimes equipment is discussed ahead of time so the Russians can't claim we're ""secretly arming Ukraine."" Other times they don't say anything so as not to tip their hand that Ukraine might suddenly have a new capability like the HARM missiles. That way they can catch Russia off guard. If they say ""something is on the way"" it's probably already there, they're not going to help the Russians potentially target the shipment as it comes into Ukraine.

One thing I'm still chuckling about is that in the 2-3 weeks leading up to the announcement that HIMARS was in Ukraine there were a few ammo dumps and strikes behind Russian lines that couldn't have been artillery. So many comments of ""with HIMARS on the way they must be using up their supply of Tochka ballistic missiles"" even though many of these were strikes in populated areas. So was it an inaccurate ballistic missile the Ukrainian's probably wouldn't fire into a populated area or was it the first few HIMARS already starting to work? Might be an interesting tidbit to try and learn about after the war.

Every countries military staff is well aware of operational security and it's not like defense officials or politicians accidentally call a press conference. Just because they're on the side of the good guys doesn't mean they aren't playing the information war game as well. People need to stop assuming that just because they haven't announced it doesn't mean they don't have it and just because they announced it doesn't mean what they said was wholly accurate. Everything they say is carefully calibrated to achieve a certain aim.

Russia could never throw its 10x advantage into invading Ukraine without losing ground in a half dozen other fronts across the northern hemisphere.

I have to disagree, this is very old thinking that really isn't applicable in today's globalized world. We no longer live in a world where Mongol hordes come out of nowhere and catch everyone by surprise before raping their hearts out and galloping off into the fog. There's a need to assert sovereignty over territory and nations must have some degree of physical mettle to back up that assertion because sovereignty by definition requires the ability to exercise security and control. However, border and territorial disputes are supposed to be dealt with diplomatically.

Every time someone mentions the need to defend borders they inevitably fail to ask the followup question, *against what?*

Militaristic dictators such as Stalin, Kim Il-Sung, and Saddam Hussein maintained large standing armies that were better fed and housed than the masses as a means of ensuring that the military could be used against the masses if such a need arose. Their militaries did not exist to protect the state from external threats but to protect the state from its own people.

No external state is going to invade Russia. Not the USA, not China, not Canada, not Japan, not Kazakhstan, etc... It's just not going to happen.

I argued many years ago that maintaining a small arsenal of nuclear weapons permits a nation to significantly deemphasize spending on its armed forces. North Korea famously has tons, and tons, and tons of old Soviet shit that would be a huge liability in any modern conflict; they can't improve them, they can't maintain any degree of readiness, and they certainly can't mount an invasion of South Korea. However, a handful of primitive nuclear weapons creates a much stronger deterrent effect for a fraction of the cost. Now, they can simply throw all of their old hardware into storage and forget about it while leaving foreign intelligence agencies guessing as to how much is serviceable.

At the same time, no nation is going to use a nuclear weapon in anger within its own borders. If the Chechens start getting rebellious again, Putin won't be able to nuke Grozny but he will be able to use the Russian military to pound the city into submission once more.",False,1660103723.0,t3_wjtf6r,t1_ijnypaj,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

Historically launches have therefore been timed to occur either about two hours before or one hour after local noon (or midnight), respectively. The orbits are such that ground-tracks repeat after a certain number of days, currently each four days for the primary satellites in the East and West orbital plane.

This whole nuke thing?  Bullshit.  If nukes come into play, we're all dead, and they're even deader that us - because if anything, the US has proven it has *great, well maintained military hardware* and Russia has proven the opposite.  So, in a nuke throwdown, my money would be on more Western shit working and more Russian shit breaking down.  Nobody wants to test that, and even at a 90% failure rate on the Russian side, which is absurdly optimistic, that's a price nobody in their right mind wants to pay.  I also just casually talked past the deaths of millions if not billions, the literal end of the world.  Nope.

So we have to solve this problem (Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine) without making Russia or Putin trapped under an existential - i.e. end of their world - threat.  Because the end of *their* world becomes the end of *the* world when they have nothing left to lose.

This means, imo: \**settles into Generally comfortable armchair*\*

1. No boots on the ground.  Regardless of how we mean it, what matters is how they interpret it, and Russia/Putin will not believe for a second that we'll politely stop at Ukraine's eastern border.  Peacekeepers in very limited areas, maybe.
2. Everything under the banner of Ukraine.  Russia must feel it is fighting a lesser power *in practice* (never mind state television's lies).  One country seems to be manageable.  The entire West *actually* going all in would put Russia in desperation mode.
2. Slow escalation.  This is why we're only now *starting* to give Ukraine certain, very obviously needed stuff.  Again, avoiding pushing Russia into desperation mode by keeping the escalation slow.
4. Avoiding a total embargo and keeping some supply/communication lines open; they need things like food, and something resembling a working economy, and we still need fossil fuels, fertilizer etc. In short neither side can be pushed to anarchy.  As per 2 and 3, this is about avoiding desperation mode, but applies to us too.
5. No external regime change.  If Putin falls or is about to fall he has no reason not to try a desperate play.  That is why Biden's gaffe about ""he cannot remain in power"" was so quickly qualified and explained by various handlers.  Mind you, I think we'd all be okay with some kind of *internal* process of regime change, it just needs to be... not us and not telegraphed.

So basically the TL;DR is, they done fucked up, but we are being careful not to smear it in their face too hard.  All of the above *happens* to align with the idea of slowly bleeding Russia out and using Ukraine as the anvil on which to smash them.  I think it's less out of a callous use of Ukraine, and more out of fear of too clearly putting Putin/Russia in a corner.

I don't see this ending quickly (and if you've been paying attention that's what a lot of different assessments say).  Years, maybe not, but months certainly.  Very likely through the winter, after spring I don't know and am certainly no expert.  If Russia finds their gains being turned around on them, and attrition of artillery/supply lines brings them to a near standstill if not destitution, if Ukraine keeps being successful in hitting their depots and such, they will have to seriously rethink whether they should get out now with something or hang on and risk ending up with nothing.  It really depends how Ukraine does in the next short while, whether the lines remain static or whether there is successful pushback.

The hard part is making Putin realize it's time to save face instead of escalate again, but chances are he's too buried in frustration and rage.  I don't know if it's even possible.

But what I'm saying is that no counteroffensive of any sort is in fact necessary.  Partisan activity in occupied territories will eventually wear the occupiers down and they will withdraw.  Now that could take 10 years or more, but it *will* happen.

The populace just won't give up on this, and eventually Russia will have to pull out (as the USSR did from Afghanistan; as the US did from Vietnam; as the coalition recently also did from Afghanistan).

Indeed, other than Israel, I'm struggling to think of any recent force maintaining an occupation over a hostile population for more than a decade or so.
