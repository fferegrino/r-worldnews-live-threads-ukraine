Day 402-403 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were pretty much completely quiet, there were no missile or drone strikes, but as usual there was, sadly, a lot of shelling of towns that are close to the frontline. Today there was also one air raid alert which was triggered because there was a threat of some Shahed being possibly launched somewhere from Russia, but I don’t think there was any follow up to that, it was most likely a fake launch to test our air defense. 

That whole story with the assassination of the famous Russian milblogger just gets weirder and weirder as the time goes by. In the usual Russian fashion, the “facts” are getting replaced almost every hour. At first, they said that the one who brought the bomb was a woman from Ivano-Frankivsk, then they said that she was actually from Saints-Petersburg. They said that she was in a hospital because she was wounded by the explosion and was detained, but in the past hour they did a 180 and said that she is actually still on the run, and the one detained was her mother.

The assassination itself is also just so bizarre, the Vladlen Tatarsky was killed by an explosive hidden in a bust of his own likeness. He literally complemented the bust being more handsome than he is on the video that was filmed mere minutes before it exploded. It’s pretty ironic that a statue of his own head exploded and destroyed his real head while his body remained mostly unharmed. 

The woman that gifted him the bust was also caught on camera, apparently, she somehow didn’t even know that there was a bomb inside, as she sat just a couple of meters away from it moments before it exploded and killed the target. The bystander witnesses said that she left the “gift” near the door and told Tatarsky about it, joked about it being a bomb and then Tatarsky said to bring it to him anyway, lmao. Like what hell is this? This assassination looks more like a comedy skit, and the situation is still developing.",False,1680475479.0,t3_1299cuc,t3_1299cuc,,0,104,0,104,0,0,

>From the perspective of a Russian soldier, the war in Ukraine must look nightmarish. In over a year of combat, nearly 200,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded, according to American officials, in a military operation that has proved both incompetent and ill equipped. Morale is reportedly low and complaints common. And yet a significant number of Russian men are still keen to fight — more, in fact, than at the war’s outset. What explains the disconnect?  
>  
>One obvious reason is fear. Men called up to the army have no choice but to obey, because opposition to the war has effectively been outlawed. In such a stifling atmosphere, fed by wall-to-wall propaganda, it’s perhaps unsurprising that discontent seems thin on the ground. Yet while fear and repression shape responses to the war, that doesn’t explain the readiness — willingness, even — of some Russian men to serve at the front. About 36 percent of Russian men are content to be conscripted, with the most supportive group being men age 45 or older.  
>  
>That’s no accident. In the three decades since the end of the Soviet Union, those men have faced industrial collapse, the disappearance of millions of jobs and declining life expectancy. The war promises to change that downward trajectory, transforming the losers of the past three decades into new heroes — even if dead or wounded. For many Russian men and their families, the war may be a horror. But it’s also the last opportunity to fix their lives.  
>  
>First, there’s the money. The federal base salary for a soldier is about $2,500 a month, with payment of $39,000 for wounding and up to $65,000 in the case of death. Compared with a median monthly salary of $545, this is a handsome reward — even more so for the approximately 15.3 million Russians living below the poverty line.  
>  
>But there’s much more on offer, too. For those coming back from the front, the state promises fast-tracked entry into civil service jobs, health insurance, free public transportation, free university education and free food at school for their children. And for those who were imprisoned and joined the Wagner private military company, the state grants freedom.  
>  
>Those promises aren’t entirely fulfilled, of course. Many troops have not been paid in full, and their wives often complain about nonpayment in public forums. Interviews with three wounded service members and their families on the anti-Kremlin network TV Rain painted a parlous picture of life at the front: no pay, no training and high casualties. Even so, the interviewees still considered the war just and wanted to return to the front or support the war efforts as volunteers.  
>  
>Another war provides the reason. Today’s troops live in the shadow of the generation that won the war against Nazism. In Russian public culture, no honor is higher than to be a veteran of the “Great Patriotic War,” something the regime has capitalized on by framing today’s war as a kind of historical re-enactment of World War II. The conflation clearly works. As one soldier wrote on Telegram in February, the war confers “a sense of belonging to the great male deed, the deed of defending our Motherland.”  
>  
>The phrase is revealing. By allowing men to escape the difficulties of everyday life — with its low pay and routine frustrations — the war offers a restoration of male self-worth. These men, at last, matter. (For women, made to suffer the brunt of the war’s fallout, it’s more vexed, but despite the difficulties, many understand and support men’s decision to serve.) Feelings of inferiority, too, are swept aside in the fraternal atmosphere of the front. “It doesn’t matter who you are, how you look,” as one soldier put it. In the communal life of conflict, many of the distinctions of civilian life dissolve. War is an equalizer.  
>  
>That surely explains its appeal to those from lower social classes. While some of the urban middle and upper classes have expressed their discontent with the war by emigrating, the poorer sections of Russian society see things differently. Mistrust of the rich, belief that sanctions actually strengthen the economy and disdain for émigrés all attest to a class-based experience of the conflict. By participating in the war, millions of Russians at the bottom of the social ladder can emerge as the country’s true heroes, ready for the ultimate sacrifice. The risk may be grave and the financial reward uncertain. But the chance to rise in esteem and respect makes the effort worthwhile.

>Such support, of course, is contingent. The longer the war drags on, bringing more casualties, loss and broken promises, the harder it may become to sustain such levels of acceptance.

- Participated in the Donbas war since 2014.

- A criminal, was in prison for bank robbery. 

- A self-proclaimed ""writer"" (I haven't read anything).

- Since Feb 2022, been on and off in the Donbas, often traveling back to Russia.

- Definitely felt very comfortable in the war.

- Had a sizeable TG following, was posting ""Evening Vladlen"" summaries to his channel every night, in addition to opinions and suggestions.

- Close associate with a number of Rascists, including RSOTM admin (Wagner group). 

He was indeed very close with Wagner.

- In recent months, began hosting an irregular show on Solovyev's channel together with the creator of Rybar. 

- Essentially, he was a minor superstar in the z-world, everyone knows him. While his death may not trigger a physical response, it will have a massive effect on the Russians. It already does.

# Ukraine lured Russians into a trap in Bakhmut, then destroyed them, here’s how:



**Bakmut**:  the northern section of the city includes “the industrial zone.”  One of the facilities is AZOM (Artëm Factory for Processing Metal), and is multiple blocks.  A month ago, it was a stronghold of UA, and we’d often see videos from inside (had that white, half-cylinder ceiling, like inside a nursery-greenhouse).  After UA pulled out of the residential SE quadrant of Bakhmut a month ago, they’ve slowly pulled out of the centre and industrial zone.  Recently, we’ve seen footage of Wagner at AZOM.

**Russians took over AZOM in the last week.**

Did Ukraine allowed it?  Was it a strategic withdrawal from the “industrial zone”?  

*Answer:* Having ***lured the Russians to AZOM*** by withdrawing, **Ukraine just blew up part of AZOM** (including dozens of Wagner, no doubt)

Biden's initial reason for not sending ATACMS was that doing so would result in escalation of the conflict. He did not elaborate on what that means but I have my thoughts on the matter.

The INF treaty signed in the late 1980s between the USA and the USSR resulted in the dismantling of all ground based ballistic missiles and ground based cruise missiles with ranges between 500km and 5,500km. This treaty remained in effect for the USA, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus up until the late 2010s.

The medium range missiles that Russia has been flinging at Ukraine are air launched or sea launched because these were not affected by the INF. Both beligerents have a small arsenal of short range ground launched ballistic missiles such as the Tocha.

I strongly suspect that Russia threatened to obtain medium and intermediate range missiles from Iran and North Korea --  exchanges that it could almost certainly fulfill with food and technology in kind -- as a response to the USA providing ATACMS.

ATACMS being a short range ballistic missile is vulnerable to many anti-aircraft systems. Medium and intermediate range missiles on the other hand are much, much harder to intercept and require advanced systems such as THAAD, GBMD, and Aegis BMD. No one can provide enough BMD to protect Ukraine from an onslaught of cheap Iranian and North Korean missiles and strategists of all nations and allies know this.

Urban is extremely complex: buildings block artillery fire from certain directions... meaning that artillery support is limited only when they can line up the shot just right. (Or alternatively, they could blow up all the buildings, but that's also a waste of ammunition).

Buildings also provide cover and concealment for troops, both Ukrainian and Russian... and even tanks effectively hide in urban areas. So ambushes are everywhere.

So generally speaking, Urban operations are some of the hardest to attack / easiest to defend locations. But the devil is in the details. As buildings are destroyed, the terrain changes.

Like in the previous one there is long speculated idea, the push south towards Melitopol, to cut the Russia land ""bridge"" to Crimea, potentially opening up the rest of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblast to be liberated, and threatening Crimea itself. It is a very obvious move, like the previous offensive in Kherson, pretty much everybody and their mother knows this move by heart now, and the Russians have been busy themselves building fortifications to meet this counter offensive. There also a few other possibilities, one that has emerged recently is the idea of exploiting the exposed flanks of the Russian units that attempted to encircled bakhmut, potentially encircling those troops or at the very least pushing the Russians back from the city, relieving the pressure on the city. This would be a less ambitious counter offensive, and honestly one might rightfully argue what the hell would be point of that, maybe you encircle a bunch of wagner mercenaries - but probably not, we've seen that when things are looking bleak and encirclement is threatened against Russian units, they are pretty quick on the run, the elite 1st tanks guards unit in Izium demonstraded for example an incredible willingness to abandon huge portions of their armored vehicles, many of which were in working order if it meant escaping potential encirclement. So in essense, this idea of exploiting the expose flanks of the Russian units would ""save"" Bakhmut but it wouldn't necessarily accomplish much more than simply pushing the Russians back a few weeks maybe months worth of progress.

There are also a few other high in the skies ideas like an amphibious crossing of the river Dnieper. That is such an outrageous idea that quite frankly i won't even bother commenting on it.

We've seen video and photo evidence of ru fielding T55 and T54 (tanks developed just after WWII, though production ran till '81), the BTR50 which also dates from that period and now also the M12 anti tank gun (most likely for artillery, because in a field with Javelins, Stingers etc I don't see them taking on a modern MBT with that). 

Either they're legit running out of more modern equipment to send to the frontlines (Upgraded T72B3, T80BVM) or they're willing to throw that equipment (and the men) into the grinder to either stall (and maybe take out a more modern vehicle) so they can keep refurbishing their leftover stock of older T72s and T62s.

Putin is willing to throw every soldier necessary to get a win out of this, because he realistically can't try for another 'Kyiv in three days' and Ukraine isn't going to wait the war out. Right now it's waiting for the equipment to arrive (Leopard, Marder, Challenger, Bradley, Abrams, AMX-10 and whatever else) and the weather to clear out (it keeps switching between either rain, mud or snow (and I thought the weather in my country was shit))

Either they're going to push into Luhansk to cut of logistics for ru near Svatove, or they're going to push in Zaporizhia to cut the occupied territory in half and mop up what's left in Kherson. My bet is on that since it would bring their Himars in range of Crimea so they can cover the Kerch bridge and the airfields to relieve the pressure of bombings on cities like Odessa, Kherson, Mykolaiv from either their planes or the Shahed drones.

Don't think they'll win this war this year, but they'll get closer to it. Even if putin gets kicked of his throne it'll just be the next putin (medvedev, lavrov, peskov, prigozhin, gerasmov, shoigu (the list is long)).

Right now despite all the setbacks russia has had, they still want to negotiate out of a strong position (otherwise they would look weak and they don't want that, it's why you see their rhetoric of 'fighting against the whole of Nato', it would be easier to sell their loss against the big bad alliance instead of the country they still call 'little russia'.

So it's either grinding down their army till they finally give up (even if it's against their mindset) or till the last occupier is dragged out in a body bag.

I recall Julia Ioffe saying that earlier on Putin had anyone in the Kremlin who was deemed disloyal towards him, particularly with respect to this war, purged.  

With dictatorships I think paranoia also plays a part in the internal strife, as does people vying for power and favour from the dictator.  

The power structure and operation of the Kremlin also has some particular effects.  

For example, if Putin lets it be known that he will win an election by 85% of the votes, each subordinate down through the Kremlin power structure will add on a little more to please their immediate boss. The result may be that Putin will ""win"" by something like 95% of the vote. Please note, I just randomly picked those numbers as an example.  

Another communication problem is that Putin doesn't give direct orders. He will suggest something to a subordinate and they will try and interpret what Putin wants, add on a little extra to please Putin, and then pass on those orders in the same manner.  

It's like the kids game of telephone where there's a chain of people. At one end the first person whispers a message to the second person, who whispers it to the next and so on. What reaches the end of the chain is quite often rather different compared to the original message.

Firstly, they don’t have a million men.

They’ve fielded about 5-600k so far. They’ve lost probably 2-300k when you include wounded.

It’s reasonable to say that Russia has somewhere between 200-400k in the field currently.

Putin says he wants to further mobilise another 170k this spring, with a total of something like another 500k in total coming over the next 9 months. Which, …remains to be seen.

If you include wounded, and let’s be conservative, Russia is also losing 250 wounded a day to make current losses more like 750 a day.

A best case number is 400k total / 750 per day = about 17 months.

A more likely number is 300k / 750 = 13 months

If the rate of losses goes up, which they probably will, it will be less than that.

Even if Russia successfully mobilises another 500k men and they somehow find equipment for them, AND the casualty rate stays at todays rate - they will last at most 3 years.

Most pundits think Russia can last maybe one to two years once you factor in economic factors. And that assumes there’s no political or economic collapse in that time.

From https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79091/is-a-resistance-poisoning-food-a-breach-of-the-chemical-weapons-convention

Civilians are not states and their militaries. Only states and military are bound by the CWC.

As a result, no breach of the CWC happens if one of the Occupied People leaves out these PIEs, which are then looted and consumed by the occupying forces. Only civilian charges are legal and retaliation against the Occupied People would be another war crime against them: Looting already is a war crime. What charges can come is dependant on how the PIEs were stored before:

Assuming the PIE is in a clearly marked container warning about the PIE being a PIE, then the Occupied People have not committed any crime.
Assuming the PIE is just left out on the table, accessible for everybody, it might be somewhere between reckless endangerment and manslaughter.
If the PIEs are instead given to the occupying forces knowing they are PIEs, the whole situation changes: suddenly we got a solid charge of [attempted] murder. This is a capital crime, and as a result, the occupying forces could prosecute. In case the occupied (NOT occupying!) country had the death sentence they could execute the perpetrator after a trial. Shooting the perpetrator on the spot, however, could be a war crime. But still, the CWC is not touched as the Occupied People did not become combatants: even when committing single acts, it takes active hostilities, which are defined as combat, to become a combatant. As they are not part of the military, not even organized militia, they can not be held up to the CWC, which by itself only binds the state and their military.",False,1680454569.0,t3_1299cuc,t1_jeoe3kf,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

Anyway, I've lived in Petersburg for over ten years. My wife is here, friends, apartment, job, everything is here. I have literally nothing to return to in New Zealand, and with the cost of living crisis and no demand for English language teachers, bringing my wife back would mean living in sheer poverty with little to no future prospects. At least here were have a comfortable apartment with no mortgage, and a countryhouse with a large garden so we are almost self-sufficient for fruit and vege for half a year. That's the basic logistics side anyway, but that's not really all of it. 

Wife's folks are old and dad is battling stage 4 cancer. Mum just had a brush with breast cancer. They realistically don't have a lot of time left so naturally my wife doesn't really want to lose this time with them. That's probably the main reason, at least for her. 

Also for me, as an English teacher, working a lot with teens, I am one of their last points of contact with the world outside Russia now, and while I have to be very careful about what I say in public, I try to at least keep their hope alive, faith that young generations always the power to decide their futures, and to question everything they see, to ask themselves not just what a person thinks and says, but why they think or say these things. Being English language students, of course my teens tend to be from more financially stable and liberal families, but still, I feel like I'm doing my little part here. The pen is mightier than the sword as they say!

And on top of that, Petersburg is just my home now. Russia is getting a lot of shit for being, well, a shithole, and it's well deserved in many many ways. But nothing is black or white and Petersburg is still one of my favourite cities that I've ever lived in, and that includes anything in NZ, Melbourne, Munich (although that's a close one), Vienna, and Budapest. I'm big into culture and art and this city has endless places to enjoy - insanely fun jazz bars, world-class classical music, literally hundreds of theaters, and hundreds and hundreds of museums. My writing, both fiction and music, thrives in this cultural history. For better or worse, I may not be truly Russian, but I might as well be.
