Latest 5 minute update from Reporting from Ukraine.    Gives a good example of why Russian losses stay very high despite being on the defense.   Russia typically launches a massive counter attack when Ukraine captures a position despite it almost always being futile.   This is WW2 doctrine, the idea is to at least slow down the Ukrainian advance and possibly recapture the position.

>Girkin says Ukraine has a chance to break through the occupiers' defence in Zaporizhzhia due to a lack of equipped and trained reserves for Russia. He revealed this in an hour-long livestream. The excerpt from a 10-minute intro is below, while the 2-minute video is a short snippet from it.

From transcription:

>The enemy has the ability to withdraw weathered formations for rest and bring up fresh ones to continue the battle. But we have the same units fighting on the front - yes, they fight in defence, but the commanders who are continuously taking part in combat don’t feel much better from this.

>It is a similar situation that led to the dismissal of the commander of the 58th Army, General Popov, who put forward an issue that existing personnel and equipment are not enough to carry out the rotation and give the troops at least some semblance of rest. And there are no reserves to bring them to a fully capable state. . . .

>This means that if urgent measures are not taken, the enemy, unfortunately, has a chance to gnaw through our defence in Zaporizhzhia. And it will be then very difficult to stop him, and no Surovikin’s line which is still in a pretty deep rear will stop the enemy if it’s not taken by trained, properly equipped, and experienced troops.

>If these troops die in the field, there will be no one to stop the enemy. This is the main question now: will the enemy be able to gnaw through our defence in 2-3 weeks, exchanging his soldiers for ours, or not, and will exhaust himself earlier.

>Gerasimov does not have prepared and equipped reserves. Simply does not. All he has is already on the frontline, at the very least in tactical reserves. Transferring from other areas means weakening them. But transferring poorly trained mobilised units who are, let’s say, covering the “old regions” of Russia, is not a solution. These units have no experience, no vehicles, no good commanders, they will be simply smashed by the enemy and no one will be able to do anything about it.""""",False,1689415219.0,t3_1501fg7,t3_1501fg7,,0,79,0,79,0,0,

For those of you complaining about the slow territory gains on the counteroffensive, please go back and watch about the last month's worth of recap videos on what has happened on a daily basis.

If you actually follow the battles directly, you'll see that the Russians are better fortified than before, but also that the Ukrainians are consistently outsmarting and out maneuvering them at virtually every turn while keeping their losses to a minimum, while maximizing damage to the opposition. There's a whole lot of ""unfortunately for the Russians"" being said in the coverage, and for good reasons.

The truth is this campaign is a grind, but that doesn't mean notable progress isn't being made. Storm Shadow missiles and other new equipment have hit deep into occupied territory and majorly hurt Russian logistics and notably increased casualties even before territory is taken. Russia, meanwhile, only uses their own missiles to attack civilian targets with poor effectiveness. We haven't seen a major strike on Ukrainian supplies for a month now, while Russia is losing lots of men and equipment daily just to try and hold the line.

>Girkin says Ukraine has a chance to break through the occupiers' defence in Zaporizhzhia due to a lack of equipped and trained reserves for Russia. He revealed this in an hour-long livestream. The excerpt from a 10-minute intro is below, while the 2-minute video is a short snippet from it.

---

>""The summer battle continues where the enemy is now not trying to break through but push through our frontline and “starve it out”.

>The enemy continues applying main efforts in the Zaporizhzhia frontline, and the second area where he is transferring reserves, including those previously unused, is Bakhmut. The enemy is trying to achieve a result wherever possible, without abandoning the plans to break the Zaporizhzhia front.

>After failures of attacks using concentrated columns, since columns like that ended up vulnerable to our artillery and aviation, the enemy moved to the tactic of a complete mixing with the ground of our units facing him. The enemy has a lot of shells, he’s not counting high-precision missiles.

>Due to this, the enemy is trying to destroy, and completely knock out the units facing him in battle. The enemy is trying to avoid mass attacks as he made sure that breakthrough doesn’t depend on the number of vehicles, whether 4 or 40, thrown into battle, only the number of burned vehicles does.

>Thus, offensive actions are led by fairly small assault groups with the support of several armoured vehicles, and all weapon systems used to destroy them are located by all types of enemy reconnaissances and then struck with artillery and high-precision missiles.

>[…]

>The enemy has the ability to withdraw weathered formations for rest and bring up fresh ones to continue the battle. But we have the same units fighting on the front - yes, they fight in defence, but the commanders who are continuously taking part in combat don’t feel much better from this.

>It is a similar situation that led to the dismissal of the commander of the 58th Army, General Popov, who put forward an issue that existing personnel and equipment are not enough to carry out the rotation and give the troops at least some semblance of rest. And there are no reserves to bring them to a fully capable state.

>[...]

>I will not be revealing a military secret - the enemy knows the situation very well, unfortunately. But even in the secondary directions, the staffing of our forces again does not exceed 70%. In areas of the most fierce battles, it is significantly less.

>Of course, it does not compare to the situation at the end of last summer/early autumn, when 20% staffing of units was considered normal, but our forces are taking losses continuously, while the stream of reinforcements and reservists from the rear has died down.

>This means that if urgent measures are not taken, the enemy, unfortunately, has a chance to gnaw through our defence in Zaporizhzhia. And it will be then very difficult to stop him, and no Surovikin’s line which is still in a pretty deep rear will stop the enemy if it’s not taken by trained, properly equipped, and experienced troops.

>If these troops die in the field, there will be no one to stop the enemy. This is the main question now: will the enemy be able to gnaw through our defence in 2-3 weeks, exchanging his soldiers for ours, or not, and will exhaust himself earlier.

>[…]

>We’re observing. Unfortuantely, we as the Angry Patriots’ Club are unable to do anything in this situation. Moreover, I understand the emotions of our Head of General Staff, the commander of the operation Gerasimov, when “some” army commander makes demands about the rotation of units.

>Gerasimov does not have prepared and equipped reserves. Simply does not. All he has is already on the frontline, at the very least in tactical reserves. Transferring from other areas means weakening them. But transferring poorly trained mobilised units who are, let’s say, covering the “old regions” of Russia, is not a solution. These units have no experience, no vehicles, no good commanders, they will be simply smashed by the enemy and no one will be able to do anything about it.""",False,1689450854.0,t3_1501fg7,t3_1501fg7,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

> In the first two weeks of Ukraine’s grueling counteroffensive, as much as 20 percent of the weaponry *it sent to the battlefield was damaged or destroyed,* according to American and European officials.

That means 20% of the armor *used in the assaults* not 20% of all of Ukraine's tanks and armored vehicles. Both the tweet and NYT are misrepresenting what happened to make it as clickbaity as possible. Yet another sign of the declining quality of the Times. As soon as I saw that in the feed I knew it was bullshit, Ukraine has hundreds of tanks in service and probably thousands of armored vehicles overall, if anything close to those numbers had been lost Russia wouldn't have had to start posting the same two battles where Ukraine lost several pieces of armor over and over again. Yes losing that much armor in assaults isn't a positive but neither is it anywhere near as dire for Ukraine as the headline would make you believe.

Anyone defending the NYT's coverage of this war needs to give their head a shake. Whatever editorial direction they have twisting the facts to make something sound as bad as possible is something for the tabloids to do, not what was ostensibly a respected source of quality journalism.

It's the idea that you can't lose ground without doing something about it, and that you want to hit back before the new frontline consolidates and gives you no way back in.

However, it means rushed and poorly thought out human wave attacks straight into the line of fire, by units who were already wavering.

It is really not appropriate for this war, and you go in without even establishing superiority of artillery, which is suicide if the Ukrainians have already mapped out which routes to fire on.

And your people being alive is more important in some instances than the positional warfare, particularly if nobody else is heading in to support you.

Roll through in 5 days and end the war.

Important to note, Russia had months to set up defensive positions and mine the shit out of everything when Bakhmut was the focus. 

The truth is Ukraine has made more gains in these last few weeks then Russia has done in months, and every day I see new information of partial gains and successes. 

I also have noted a change in tactics, I read a post which showed the first “part” if you will of the counter offensive Ukraine was losing about 20% of equipment, this has drastically changed and halved now to about 10% and we have noticed a massive switch on destroying artillery systems. Which is marked by the daily numbers and have steadily remained on 20+ a day.

Russia is starting to lose artillery advantage now which is noticeable and this is where you’ll start to see increased pushes with personnel. I’ve seen many RU channels report retreats due to just heavy Ukrainian artillery shelling!

>Presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threw a press dinner on Tuesday night that devolved into a shouting match between two elderly men—a bizarre conflict that reportedly ended with a prolonged bout of flatulence. As relayed by a Page Six reporter who was present, the mess started after a guest asked Kennedy a question about the environment, an innocent-enough inquiry that enraged former gossip columnist Doug Dechert, the—reportedly drunk—host of the whole event. “The climate hoax!” Dechert started to yell. His senile screams drew the ire of his longtime friend, art critic and longtime Daily Beast contributor Anthony Haden-Guest, who wasted no time condemning Dechert and pleading for him to “shut up.” But Dechert was relentless, continuing to rant about the “scam” of climate change while Haden-Guest disparaged him with insults, calling him “fucking insane” and “insignificant.” That’s when Dechert brought out his secret weapon: a booming fart that he released while shouting, “I’m farting!”

The 5000 helmets were not something Scholz or Lambrecht suggested and considered equal to British, Swedish or American deliveries at the time. Some higher member of the MoD suggested to send the helmets while they look through the, infamously poor, storages of the Bundeswehr, as to what they could dispose and send to Ukraine. The decision was answered by a 'Uhm... sure' and the government didn't comment any further, suggesting that they were indeed meant as serious and final aid attempts to Ukraine for the time. A few hundred Strela AA systems and a couple of hundred [thousand?] Panzerfaust 3's followed, but the meme '5000 helmets of Scholz' was already born. That's also why there're no Panzerfaust memes, but an abundance of Stinger, Carl Gustav and Javelin ones.

The PzH 2000's were among the first weapon the Bundeswehr and MoD decided to be disposable. Those systems are among the, if not _the_, best SPH's of the world. Highly accurate, mobile af, armoured, high rate of fire and great firepower. Ukraine was also immediately fond of them, ordering 100 more, ASAP. They didn't order no M777, no Krab, no Ceasar and no other non-rocket artillery system till now.

Yet, articles like [these](https://militarywatchmagazine.com/article/german-weapons-poor-failing-ukraine-turkey) surfaced almost immediately. Some Polish mil bloggers [one's name was something lik Wiludchek?] bombarded them as trash, because they had to be quickly repaired. Ukrainian soldiers explained that they used the PzH 2000 as frontline firefighters, driving from hotspot to hotspot, 24/7 and had a massive wear and tear, which no system would shrug off easily. The reputational damage was already done in some media outlets, tho. And the appearance of HIMARS soon after drove the spotlight away.

The Leopard 2 debate was a complete joke, from start to finish. PiS waged a propaganda war on Berlin and Berlin only answered to official statements, leaving PiS to run wild and claim shit every day. Scholz only said 'I'll visit the US soon, as scheduled' in a maner of atrocious communication, making it seem like he'd ask papa Joe for his OK on the topic. Meanwhile PiS held speeches bout German refusal to grant a request to send Tanks to Ukraine. A request which was never sent. People ate it up and every news space was full of people bombarding Scholz and his government. The UK was balls deep in privatizing the NHS so the Tori-close murdoch boulevard journals directed their attention toward the EU's, de-facto, strongest nation, fanning the flames of anger. Especially after said nation took their place after the Brexit. Ben fucking Wallace even held an interview, in which he said 'I have information that an unnamed nation sent a request to Germany to deliver Leopard 2 tanks' which made it worse. As it turned out: He lied.

During the Ramstein meeting a few days later, no Leopard 2 coalition could be established, due to the unwillingness of the Leo user states. Not even Poland pushed for it, as the Polish MoD reportedly stayed silent on the topic. Yet PiS leaders at home pushed the narrative of German brakes on Polish heroism. 

NCD, WorldNews and the Europe sub still push that narrative at times. Absoutely stupid.

In Western countries, there is a lot of popular support for helping Ukraine defend themself and liberate their territory, but not so much for enabling Ukraine to do strategic attacks on Russia.

From a military point of view, such attacks are part of an effective defense, but this isn't about military tactics, but about having the support of a democratic majority in the friendly countries.

If a leader of a western country just gives a lot of long range weapons to Ukraine and says they can do what they want with it, there is a chance that this would end the public support for helping Ukraine and stop future weapon deliveries altogether. So the leaders have to walk a fine line.

Again, that is not because everyone fears the mighty Russia and its nukes,.Most people in western countries are willing to defend themselves and help friendly nations to defend themself, but don't want to support any kind of aggression. Even is Russia has started the war.

Contrary to Russian propaganda, no one in NATO and the rest of the western world, has any interest in attacking Russia. They just want to be left alone and live in peace.",False,1689406138.0,t3_1501fg7,t1_js19xgu,,2,22,0,22,0,0,

Deterrence is a strategy based on escalation resulting in massive damage to the enemy in response to a conflict. NATO is funding and supporting a denial strategy in Ukraine, not a deterrence strategy. The reason for this is because as poorly as Russia troops perform on the battlefield, Russia does have an escalatory path available (e.g., tactical nukes) and would be compelled by precedence to choose this path.

**Scenario**: NATO gives Ukraine Tomahawk missiles with no restrictions on their use. Ukraine launches salvo after salvo on Russian soil destroying military assets all over the country. How do you think Russia is realistically likely to respond?

**Option A:** Withdraw troops from Ukraine, signaling to the world that Russia will never escalate no matter how bad it gets and that any country who possess Tomahawk missiles is immune from Russian aggression. Then sit around and watch while every country bordering them gets these weapons.

**Option B**: Put its 4.5 gen fighter to use by delivering tactical nuclear strikes on Ukrainian military installations. Knowing full well NATO will have to wrestle with how to respond (all out warfare with Russia or capitulation.)

Option B is almost a certainty because, despite such an attack by Ukraine not being existential to Russia, it would be such a massive strategic defeat as to be equivalent. There's no way Russia would sit by and not respond to a threat of that magnitude.

Now, there's a big difference between using Tomahawks to level Russian assets as far away as Omsk and using a Storm Shadow to destroy Russian assets in areas adjacent to the Ukrainian border, but to Russia the distinction isn't as great.

Personally, I think we could probably get away with allowing these missiles to be used to hit Russian war assets, but not other Russian assets (power, nuclear weapons sites, etc), in the border areas. But, the risk that they're misused, even accidentally, and set Russia on an escalatory path is too great to risk.

I have no in-depth knowledge of how Interpol functions and how it came to that situation.

And technically, Interpol did not take further steps than arresting him and letting him go. 

It's pretty safe to assume that Russia somehow found a loophole in the way Interpol functions and operates, in order to achieve this, especially since he, himself, did not know anything about being wanted by Interpol.

In fairness to them though, the bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999 was the only time they acted offensively on their own. When Serbia was bombed, NATO did not have authorization from the UN Security Council. They tried to get it, but when they found that they couldn't because of Russia & China being opposed, NATO said ""fuck it"" and went ham on Serbia and stopped the genocide on their own. 

The UNSC resolution that created KFOR wasn't passed until after the bombing had already taken place.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia

""Yugoslavia's refusal to sign the Rambouillet Accords was initially offered as justification for NATO's use of force. NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the UN Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia, who indicated that they would veto such a measure. As a result, NATO launched its campaign without the UN's approval, stating that it was a humanitarian intervention. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack – neither of which were present in this case.

The bombing was NATO's second major combat operation, following the 1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was the first time that NATO had used military force without the expressed endorsement of the UN Security Council and thus, international legal approval, which triggered debates over the legitimacy of the intervention.""",1689429803.0,1689428936.0,t3_1501fg7,t1_js1z48j,,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,

You're not understanding the fallacy. This isn't about judging the decision. It's about using it as a reason to doubt the credibility of the NYTimes today.

The stance at the time of 1865 has nothing to do with the stance they hold today.

Telling people they should dismiss NYTimes articles today because it held deplorable positions 80 years ago is counter-informative and lazy.
