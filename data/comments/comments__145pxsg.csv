The last couple of days weren’t the quietest. There were two separate cruise missile strikes in our region in the last 2 days, which is pretty surprising because they almost exclusively use the S-300 missiles to hit any of their targets here. Drones and cruise missiles have a much greater range than S-300 missiles, so it’s always weird to see them used on cities barely 30km away from the border.

Some of the cruise missiles were even spotted flying over in the sky Kharkiv and changing directions in the air. They weren’t targeting Kharkiv directly, but the missile did land somewhere in our suburbs, thankfully I don’t think there were any casualties in that strike. We don’t see cruise missiles here often, so many people were startled when they first heard, and then saw the missile maneuvering over their heads.

People are greatly overreacting after seeing the first photos of the lost western equipment. The exact same and even worse losses were being posted during the start of the Kherson counteroffensive, but I guess they just didn’t have the same impact on people because the vehicles we were losing were soviet instead of western. While any equipment losses look bad, they are expected to happen. The good thing is that it seems most of the crews survived, which means that the equipment has served its purpose by protecting the people who were inside.",False,1686434936.0,t3_145pxsg,t3_145pxsg,,0,143,0,143,0,0,

> Good! The feedback from the Ukrainians on the German weapons is very positive. Take the PzH2000 self-propelled howitzer, whose chassis and weapon systems were supplied by Rheinmetall. We actually say that the barrel needs to be changed after about 4500 rounds. But the Ukrainians fire up to 20,000 rounds - actually impossible. Other tubes would have buckled long ago.

> **You want to set up your own factory in Ukraine for the Panther main battle tank you developed yourself. Aren't you getting a bit carried away?**

> In what way?

> **So far, there's only one prototype, and experience with armor projects like the Puma infantry fighting vehicle shows that you need years to get to series production, and then more until everything works.**

> If you want to bring a new product to market, you have to start at some point. We are currently working on getting the Panther ready for series production and expect to be ready to launch in 15 to 20 months. Teething troubles are normal and can be eliminated quickly.

> **Isn't a tank factory in Ukraine an easy target for Russian missiles?**

> There are defense factories in Ukraine even today. Such facilities can be protected. Assume that the Ukrainians know how to do that.

Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar: ""War is not without losses. The most terrible but inevitable losses are people. And unfortunately, military equipment that cannot be destroyed has not yet been created. But today's wars take place in two dimensions - real and informational. Information battles are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, rules and laws. For example, any party to an armed conflict seeks to show the enemy's losses and classifies its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Why? Because the more information about the enemy is publicly available, the easier it is to calculate their capabilities and plans. In addition to intelligence, which is now very difficult for the Russians on our territory, there are other ways to extract the necessary information by throwing provocations into the information space. In this way, you can force the other side to give out as much information about itself as possible. For example, by encouraging justifications and refutations. To do this, very inflated figures are thrown at us in the expectation that we will indignantly begin to refute and give out some data or indirect references to them. Or, for example, information about the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief or other commanders is being thrown around, expecting comments and refutations with photos and videos showing where they really are. Therefore, we must understand that we are fighting with information, just like the enemy.""",False,1686370723.0,t3_145pxsg,t3_145pxsg,,0,260,0,260,1,0,

>
>(2/4) In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower.

>(3/4) Russian performance has been mixed: some units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields.

""Russia transferred Ukrainian prisoners of war to Hungary on Thursday, through the mediation of the Russian Orthodox Church, according to a statement from the church. 

The statement added that the transfer of the prisoners -- who are of Transcarpathian origin -- was done at the request of Hungary.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his government have always been by far the closest ally of the Kremlin within the European bloc, leading to thorny diplomatic relations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. At the same time, Hungary has been providing assistance to Ukrainian refugees who have fled to the country. 

Hungary and Ukraine have been in a long-standing dispute over the treatment of the ethnic Hungarian minority in Ukraine, according to Reuters.

Ukrainian foreign minister spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko said in a statement on Friday that while Ukraine welcomes news about prisoners of war being released, it was not informed about the negotiations between Russian and Hungarian officials, and found out through the media and public statements by Hungarian officials.

""We have learnt from public statements by the Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister that Russia has handed over eleven Ukrainians of Hungarian origin to Budapest,"" Nikolenko said.

The Ukrainian foreign ministry official said the Hungarian Charge d'Affaires was invited to the Ukrainian foreign ministry for a “substantive conversation.""""",False,1686400077.0,t3_145pxsg,t3_145pxsg,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

""Ukrainian forces have advanced nearly a mile in the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region in the past day, Ukraine’s military said.

“Taking advantage of the fact that the enemy was conducting rotational activities and swapping its units, we were trying to strike at the enemy and counterattack. During the last 24 hours, we managed to advance up to 1400 meters (0.87 miles) in different areas,” Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the Eastern Grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said on national TV.

Russian forces are “actively defending and trying to hit our units,” he added.

“We are moving towards a trend where our forces will be in more favorable positions than the enemy. We have already taken a number of hills,” Cherevatyi said.

Some background: The front line in eastern Ukraine is still the “epicenter” of the fighting, Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, said on Friday, adding that Ukrainian troops were “engaged in active combat” around Bakhmut.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, claimed on May 20 to have captured the city after a prolonged battle, adding that he would hand Bakhmut over to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated “the completion of the operation.""

Footage released by both sides, especially by the Russians, allows to form a better picture of the situation at the front, the challenges both sides face, and even allow us to start placing the blame for some Ukrainian failures. 

Now, as the offensive began Ukraine turned off the good news tap. They're not publicizing their defeats but also keeping mum on their successes. Russians are also not publicizing their defeats, of course. But the sudden vacuum allows them to milk every Ukrainian misstep to the fullest.

They released enough videos of the famous Leopard convoy for us to form a pretty good picture of what happened. The small platoon-sized column was staging for an attack at night, a few km away from the line of contact. The column was spotted and engaged by a Ka-52 which lobbed at least one missile which hit at least one vehicle. Then, many hours later during daytime, Russians had multiple drones on it and shelled it multiple times. Their daytime drone-guided artillery mostly hit empty fields, as usual. 

Since then Ukraine is quietly but steadily advancing, while Russians barely have anything new to show for it. If the offensive had been failing, if Russians were inflicting heavy casualties, we'd be seeing far, far more burning vehicles, and we'd also be seeing all that filmed by counter-attacking infantry and not by drones. 

Videos released by Ukraine do show impressive successes, huge groups of Russians running away without a weapon in sight, huge Russian supply columns blown up. We can see that once Ukrainians get close enough to the Russians, they can take the position.

The problem is crossing that no-man's land. That is why Ukraine is going with small columns and attacking so slowly. 

It's not their choice. It's not their lack of training or foresight. It's a deliberate choice because they are missing one crucial element that would otherwise close that gap: air power.

Key Takeaways

1. Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations in at least four areas of the front on June 10.  
1. Russian forces in Zaporizhia Oblast are continuing to defend against Ukrainian attacks in accord with sound tactical defensive doctrine.  
1. Russian milbloggers continue to highlight reported superior Russian electronic warfare (EW) capabilities as key to disrupting Ukrainian attacks.  
1. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces have tactical advantages in conducting assaults at night due to Western-provided equipment with superior night optics systems.  
1. Russian sources continue to highlight the role of scarce military district-level Russian TOS-1A thermobaric artillery systems in defending against Ukrainian counteroffensive operations, though Ukrainian forces destroyed at least two of these key systems in recent days.  
1. Ukrainian forces are currently attempting an extraordinarily difficult tactical operation – a frontal assault against prepared defensive positions, further complicated by a lack of air superiority – and these initial assaults should not be extrapolated to predict all Ukrainian operations.  
1. Chechen Republic Head Ramzan Kadyrov established a clear rhetorical line between criticizing the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin.  
1. Russian forces targeted a Ukrainian operational airfield during another missile and drone strike on Ukraine on the night of June 9 to 10.  
1. Russian forces made marginal advances northeast of Kupyansk and continued ground attacks near Kreminna.

The counteroffensive is going better than expected, actually better than previous Ukraine offensives and exponentially better than any Russian offensive until this date.

Every single Ukrainian large land reclaims since the beginning of the war have functioned in the same way: 

1. Ukraine pummels russian defense lines with artilery and tanks for weeks and months, looking for breakthroughs. 
2. Russian soldiers brag on social media how heavy ukrainean loses are and how they are holding all attacks while behind the scenes begging their commanders to take them somewhere else and hiding their loses.
3. Russians take heavy loses and at one point in time decide they can't take anymore and they pack their bags and abandon a large area. This step usually occurs suddenly, with no prior warning and in spite of all previous social media announcements about how all Ukrainian attacks have been repelled and all Russian positions are holding strong.

The scenario repeated both when Ukraine took Kherson, Khrkiv and parts of Luhansk. Exactly the same.  I remember before Ukraine retook Kherson(in the famous Kherson offensive) Pro Russian twitter and Telegram channels were making fun of Ukraine of not taking a single kilometre of land after weeks of attacks. All Russian Twitter and Telegram channels were filled with Russians soldiers with a calm demeanor telling how Ukrainians have been 100% repelled. One night, with no explanation all of the Russian army in Kherson retreated. Just like that out of the blue and all propagandists on twitter and tg started wondering why on Earth are the Russians retreating while the soldiers were posting stories of 100% repealed attacks just hours prior. It's what I call the ""Russian Usain Bolt retreat"": just like usain bolt is calm before the start of the race but when the signal gun fires he used to sprint very quickly so do the Russians with the retreat: they look calm at the beginning but when the loses mount they do the usain bolt and run like the wind in the opposite direction of the ukrainean army.

And this can become very weird. I remember the day Ukraine started to break through in Luhansk there was a frontline village where a Russian propagandist had been in the morning and posted pictures about how the village was holding and it was 100% in control of the russian army only for the Russians to be driven out literally a couple of hours later. 

Russian retreat are very quick and sudden. Don't expect bakhmut type defense from the Russian army where they defend every meter of land. That just won't happen.

The fact that Ukraine has actually taken some kilometres of land right now in just a couple of days of this offensive means that this offensive is going a lot better than the previous Kherson, Kharkiv and Luhansk offensives. It took weeks and months of grinding before those Russian fronts collapsed and Russia did the Usain bolt in another area.

The Ukrainian tank commander was right: stop dooming and glooming and wait at least a couple of months before calling this Ukrainian offensive a failure.",False,1686441002.0,t3_145pxsg,t3_145pxsg,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

We already saw it in action with the fake photo of a Leopard 2 destroyed, they produce an easily debunked fake simply to flood out accurate information with falsehoods.

With the real footage of Ukrainian losses, Russia reedited and captured multiple angles and shots of the same wrecks, to repeatedly release it as though it were new losses. This is going to happen frequently as Russia seeks to hurt Ukraine's image and exaggerate their losses. 

Russia will also claim that Ukrainian attacks are occurring when they are not, to later claim that they fended them off with great success, likely timing this with the re-release of footage and destroyed equipment.

They may also release videos, in which Russian soldiers dress as Ukrainian soldiers and stand in front of a camera, making some sort of appeal to the higher ups to ""end the slaughter"", they will claim its a Ukrainian unit and they were thrown into battle with no equipment, or suicidal orders etc.

They may release faked videos of Ukrainian war crimes, especially against POWs as Russia likely seeks to increase their own soldiers morale and decrease their willingness to surrender.

There is truth to this, in that the independence of Taiwan has been held by the threat of conflict with the US and the west in general, and the question of whether US military support is a bluff or not is being proven out by the stolidity of our support for Ukraine.

But . . . The invasion of Taiwan would be very very different in so many ways from the present war. And a lot of those key differences seem to be missed. I'd like to lay them all out.

First the things that make the invasion of Taiwan *easier* than an invasion of Ukraine:

1. **Taiwan is a lot less populous and a looooot smaller then Ukraine.** Even a successful military campaign in Ukraine was doomed to eventual failure because the Russian military lacked the capability to *hold* Ukraine in the long term. This should have been a deterrent, except that Putin is an idiot. In any case, China does not lack that capability.

2. **The Russian military was not designed with campaigns like the present one in mind, whereas the Chinese PLA was very much designed for this exact scenario.** The core capabilities the Russian Armed Forces were designed for was defense of their own soil, and limited projection of power. They wanted to be able to deter invasion of the homeland, while being able to influence events abroad like in Syria. The Ukraine campaign didn't look like either of those and that's a significant reason that the initial invasion looked so slapdash. Russia was fighting in ways it was not designed to fight, and required capabilities that it simply lacked on a large scale. The Chinese Military has spent decades modernizing its army with a view on the capabilities needed to invade Taiwan.

3. **Taiwan does not have as deeply rooted a national identity as Ukraine.** Which is not to say Taiwan doesn't have a national identity of it's own, simply that it is different. While Russia has occupied Ukraine for much of the last 200 years, there is a much longer history of political and cultural separation before that. The Russian and Ukrainian languages diverged 1500 years ago (by Ethnologue's lexical similarity index, they are about as similar to each other as English and Spanish.) Putin saw Ukrainians as fundamentally Russian and thought they would be apathetic at the prospect of rule from Moscow instead of Kiev. That was a deep misunderstanding of the Ukrainian identity. Taiwan's identity is more nuanced. Most of modern Taiwan does not descend culturally or genetically from the native population of the island, but from mainland settlers that arrived within the last three centuries (and mostly within the last 75 years.) 85% speak Mandarin that is completely intelligible with the mainland dialects. Taiwan has a strong and unique political identity, but it doesn't see itself as ethnically distinct. I do not know how hard they would ultimately resist, but I would caution that we cannot use Ukraine as a model here.

And now, things that make an invasion of Taiwan *harder*:

1. **Amphibious landings are hard.** I don't think I need to sell you on this. There are no natural defenses between Russia and Ukraine. Taiwan has the best kind of natural defense there is.

2. **China is a net importer of food and fuel.** I think this is the most important difference, and one I haven't really seen discussed. Economic sanctions at their heart are just reductions in trade; modern economies depend on trade, and the more you cut off, the more it will hurt that economy. But what kind of trade you are actually cutting makes a big difference in the timeline of the pain. Russia is a huge exporter of food and energy; their economy has been battered by sanctions, and the impacts will only compound over time, but as we have seen that timeline is measured in years. China is an importer of both fuel and food, and they need sea lanes for those imports. An economic war with China would be incredibly painful for the economy of the US (and for everyone, China is a muuuuch bigger economy than Russia) but China is far more vulnerable to sanctions or embargo than Russia. The timeline on which a reduction in international trade would start to really hurt China would be significantly shorter.

And finally some unknowns:

1. **How ready is the Chinese military?** For all their modernization efforts, China is completely untested. How well trained are their troops? How flexible is their leadership? How bad is corruption? These are things that are basically impossible to know until the rubber meets the road. Russia actually was a pretty well-tested military, and no one knew how bad things had gotten until the going got tough in Ukraine.

2. **How will the US actually react?** Direct war? Strong embargo? Weak sanctions? Taiwan is much more directly important to US interests than Ukraine ever was. There is reason that the US has been so vocal that they will stand up for Taiwan (where they didn't really for Ukraine). But if China actually goes for it, does the US really go to war with China? Nobody knows.

3. **How will Taiwanese defenses hold?** The US is really far away and China's really close. Even if the US means it that they will go to war over the defense of Taiwan, the Taiwanese need to hold off the PLA on their own for days before the US could make a show of force. Just like how crucial the first few hours of the defense of Kiev were, the first 72 hours of this invasion would completely change the shape of the conflict. The US Navy, with its trillions of dollars of budget, doesn't mean a thing if Taiwan can't hold long enough for them to get there in force.",False,1686415417.0,t3_145pxsg,t3_145pxsg,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

It is his opinion that Ukraine has not yet achieved wide success in the counteroffensive and also describes how Ukraine was unable to capitalize on what success it has. He predicts that the longer the initial phases of the attack go on, the less success they will have as Russia can commit more reserves to that area of the line. 

He further predicts that if Ukraine cant achieve a breakthrough, they will reposition their forces to attack somewhere else, like towards Svatove. He believes it isn't impossible for Ukraine to break through, but its unlikely, and as he puts it ""depends simply on the supply of ammunition and equipment in the attacked area"", further he states that following this counteroffensive, Russia will not have the manpower or resources to conduct their own offensive.

While this is just his prediction, it rings eerily similar to what actually occurred last year during Ukraine's Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives.

In Kherson at first Ukraine achieved no success in breaking the Russian lines, and the offensive stalled significantly.  Then on a weaker area of the front, Ukraine massively broke the Russian lines and exploited the advantage very effectively. It would take weeks more for Ukraine to finally liberate Kherson, and it was primarily because Ukraine was able to deny Russian soldiers resupply on the right bank of the Dnieper river  (By blowing up all the bridges/ferry crossings and pntoons)

With this information we could somewhat predict what may happen with the rest of the counteroffensive. In the next 3-7 days if Ukraine isn't able to achieve success in Zaporizhizia they will likely call off the counter offensive there, fall back and return to a status quo of longer range artillery duels to degrade Russian forces.

After which those units will probably reposition to another area of the front and attempt a breakthrough that will likely be more successful, particularly in liberating smaller settlements and a wider area of land. This could be Bakhmut, It could be Svatove or even areas around Donetsk itself. Such an attack wont be as strategically significant as liberating Meltiopol or Mariupol, but is far more attainable with fewer losses.

Following this, Ukraine would probably settle into a period where they attempt destroy to Russian logistics as best they possibly can. In the mean time, the offensive brigades would rearm and refit from whatever losses they had sustained. Then possibly attack in the same area they did in Zaporizhizia, this time with more success.

tl;dr: this offensive may end up looking a lot like the offensive we saw last year, in good ways and bad ways. This depends upon similar factors like western arms shipments, and Russian logistical issues.",False,1686446783.0,t3_145pxsg,t3_145pxsg,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

Plus previous to 2014 the Ukrainian Navy suffered from even more neglect than other parts of its armed forces had, after 2014 it wasn't considered much of a priority to build back up compared to land forces. Ukraine used mainly small vessels to patrol their remaining Black Sea coast and had a frigate and a handful of corvettes left.

For the past week they have been showing the same video of the destroyed column from different angles claiming it was destruction of all UA troops.  The numbers they repeat from the Russian propaganda machines are unreal.  30 tanks, 40 tanks, 35 tanks destroyed in each one of these battles 1500, 2000, 1000 troops destroyed.  Idk how they can keep repeating these numbers without reflection. 

Would be fascinating to have someone total all of russia's reported tank kills just to show how ridiculous the claims are... It'd be thousands and thousands by now, way more than AFU even has available.

I have no doubt that this is a tough fight.  But it's frightening to see what so many people seem to buy into.

I try to take the individual reports from both sides with a grain of salt and focus on the bigger picture.

Since the beginning of the war, Russia has been able to secure the south and parts of the east.  Any advances since then have been minimal, incremental, or involved overwhelming cost and time (Bakhmut).  There have been zero breakthroughs or evidence that Russia is capable of taking anything significant.  

Meanwhile, Ukraine has effectively defended Kyiv, and has taken back vast areas around Kherson and Kharkiv, proving that they are capable of effective counter offensives.

In the beginning of the war, no one realized how modern artillery would change warfare and armies just got slaughtered. In the middle of the war, there was a phase where they just leaned into it. If warfare was going to be so fearsomely deadly, they tried to set up battles where the entire point was just to continuously slaughter. To grind meat.  Verdun is one of the most famous and deadly. 

After a couple years of that, armies started to have problems with mutiny (can't imagine why). The Russian Empire collapsed in revolution and the USSR was born. (The meat grinding warfare of WWI is a direct contributing factor to the creation of the USSR. Fun fact!) 

By the end of the war, early tanks and airplanes joined the battle, especially on the Allies side. The Axis was blockaded and had production issues that prevented the same scale of industrial development. Combined arms warfare was born, breaking the stalemate and ending the meat grinding.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae

At the Battle of Cannae, the Carthaginian general Hannibal faced a Roman Legion.  The Romans were famous for this very direct attack with their excellent heavy infantry.  They wanted to close with their enemy, and push straight through the middle of the battlefield.

In response Hannibal set his soldiers in reverse crescent moon formation curling away from the Romans, so as the Romans pushed into the center of Hannibal's forces, by just natural movement of the men, Hannibal's unengaged flanks folded up around the sides of the Roman line, enveloping and destroying the entire Roman Legion.

So, it looks like the Ukrainians put up a giant gigantic fight at Bakhmut with the primary intention of bleeding the Russians to death.  At some point it became clear to the Ukrainians that the Russians were in someways reinforcing the city with soldiers on the flanks, or placing units that were mulched in the city on the flanks to recover.

Thus as the Russians advanced up the center, the flanks of their position have become progressively weaker.  Now the Ukrianians are pushing up the sides in a reprise of what Hannibal did to the Romans.",False,1686404881.0,t3_145pxsg,t1_jnnng7t,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

Russia had concentrated their best military forces in vast numbers towards a singular goal - capturing Bakhmut.   Nothing else was going on for months on end.   

With sheer force of will they did indeed manage to take the city (at great cost).   Now, with Wagner cycling out, and pressure to the north and south Russia is at a disadvantage in the city and Ukraine is taking advantage of this opportunity to return the favor.

Based on reports, this isn't without cost to AFU, but it is the best chance they will have in the near future.


That said, this is a bit more complex and nobody knows precisely what the military strategy is; however, some theorize that Ukraine is trying to tie up as many forces in Bakhmut as possible while simultaneously causing a diversion around Belgorod in order to limit the amount of force Russia can focus on the southern axis.

If you remember, Ukraine did something similar during last year's offensive.  AFU pushed simultaneously on Kharkiv and Kherson, splitting the Russian effort on opposite ends and eventually taking both objectives.

If all goes well, hopefully we will see something similar here.  If the southern axis or Bakhmut begins to break, Russia may panic allowing Ukraine to make advances in both fronts, ideally cutting the southern land bridge and retaking Bakhmut area while causing chaos in Belgorod and weakening Russian civilian morale.

2b9f572ddb754c9f72426b4b73283132,145pxsg,jnonuh1,"A few more ""things that make an invasion of Taiwan harder:""

1) Taiwan does a huge share of the worlds global production of semiconductors, one of the key input resources of the global economy. It produces 60% of global semiconductors and 90% of the advanced ones. Yes, its one of those things you don't believe you haven't hear of before you do, but if Taiwan got hit by an asteroid, you wouldn't be able to buy anything electronic for a decade.

The government explicitly places semiconductor factories where an invading army would have to destroy them in order to conquer Taiwan. Semiconductor factories are incredibly fragile, so any idea of a fast war and getting them back online in a few months is out of the question.

2) This has already been partially addressed, but the problem with amphibious landings isn't just the landing part. There are miles of open sea between Taiwan and China, and sinking 10 000 enemy troops in ships using missiles, bombs or torpedoes is much more trivial than destroying 10 000 troops dispersed trough mountains and forests, invisible to radar, moving a few hundred feet every day. If Chinese transport ships appear on the horizon, Taiwan isn't flying old Soviet airplanes to bomb them.

3) Taiwan is fully trained to use modern and plentiful western equipment. One of the huge bottleneck's both early in the war and even now is that there are thousands of tanks, artillery, drones, helicopters and airplanes countries might want to send to Ukraine, but nobody in Ukraine would be able to actually operate them. Taiwan can be given more weapons by the west from day 1.

4) The Taiwanese government and people are much more prepared than Ukraine was. The internet loves to call Putin an idiot for going to war with Ukraine, but it did actually work great for Putin the first time. He did a lightning fast operation, took Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk and got away with it. Taiwan is more unified and its government is better prepared for a Chinese first strike.

5) A minor point, but Taiwan has made an big effort to attract human rights and humanitarian organizations and have them put their headquarters in Taiwan. Any Chinese invasions would be additionally diplomatically damaging and play badly in the global media.

6) There are good reasons to believe than Japan (the 3rd largest economy) would react much more severely to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan than the EU was thought it would react to a Russian invasion of Ukraine.",1686421223.0,1686420720.0,t3_145pxsg,t1_jnobqaa,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

How and why do you feel the Ukrainians will abuse them?  If you constitute them using ATACMS on the “liberators” is abusive, then it sounds like you are pro-Russian to fully manipulated the word abused.

ATACMS is the only active cluster munition the US Army possesses.  There is an ATACMS variant that has cluster munitions that will be perfect on enemy troop concentrations.  Then there are ATACMS that will destroy any hard structure building that maybe housing Soldiers.  That is not abuse.  This is warfare.

Offensive operations are a grind, not only on equipment and supplies, but on manpower as well. You can go a certain period of time to sustain operation without compromising the intensity and effectiveness of attack. You can prolong it by slower operational tempo, careful rotation of troops and judicious choices when deciding to hold or retreat from positions where troops will be maximally exposed. But eventually, they will wear down.

Now, this could be prolonged and pushed past the limits, either by forcing artificial means of pushing the troops beyond their limits (box of *panzerscholokaden,* anyone?) or throwing countless bodies into the drive to achieve mission objectives.

Yes, the West has helped build up their economy, but they are so ridiculously far behind where they could have been if Britain hadn't used them as a labor and conscription pool of bodies for 100 years.

Ukraine fears and hates Russia because their population was genocided by the Russia-led Soviet Union in the 20th Century. India's genocides, however, came at the hand of Western Europeans, and they also received a lot of support from Russia in the 20th Century.

True. I didn't want to go into too much detail on this small point, but it merits some explanation. Having descended from a common language isn't the only reason languages can be similar. Ethnologue's lexical similarity index (ELSI) is based entirely on how many words for the same thing are similar in two languages. English gets over half its vocabulary from French due to the Norman invasions, hence English has a lot of cognates with Romance languages. The ELSI is not perfect but it is a good shorthand for how mutually intelligible two languages are. There is a belief on the internet (encouraged by Russian nationalism) that Russian and Ukrainian are basically the same language with a high degree of mutual intelligibility, and my point was just that no, they're in practice about as similar as English and Spanish.

Of course, most Ukrainians do speak Russian (less so in the west of the country), but as you said, language and culture are not the same.

My larger point about the Russian and Ukrainian languages being quite different was not that language and culture and identity are the same thing. They're not.

2) Big agree

3) Agree, but with the caveat that I have read many reports that stress grumblings of low readiness in the Taiwanese armed forces. Being on high alert for 75 years has possibly created some culture of numbness to the danger.

4) This is the only point that I somewhat disagree with. Between 2014 and 2022 there was a complete transformation of the Ukrainian military. I don't know how Taiwan's present preparedness compares to Ukraine before Feb 2022. I certainly wouldn't feel confident with the assertion that Taiwan is more ready.

5) Sure, but I don't really know that China cares about this.

6) I don't think Japan is joining the war. I'm sure they will work feverishly on Taiwan's behalf, but I don't think that their impact will be a gamechanger.

Yes what you said would follow a defense in depth strategy where your first line is not the strongest but that is assuming the Russians not only are properly deployed but also that they respond to the attacks well and ensure that each line is manned, is well supplied and ready to fight. As we have seen the Russian army can just be wildly uneven in its effectiveness. It's clear some formations can be decently trained and effective and the next barely competent enough not to shoot each other. I would assume corruption and incompetence which have dogged military reform in Russia ever since the USSR broke up would be responsible.

I would guess that might be why it seems like Ukraine is attacking along such wide sections of the front instead of concentrating their combat power as that would be the best way of finding the weakest units. Doesn't matter how great one section of your front line is defended if their right flank is torn up they'll probably be forced to retreat anyway, especially if the effort respond to Ukrainian attacks run into muddy command structures, poor communications and a lack of cohesion between units. And I know that Ukraine also deals with varying level of unit quality and command and control issues but in the Russian army it seems like the differences can be even more extreme.

Anyway I think we can assume that the chronic problems the Russian military has with infighting, supply and command and control issues might mean what looks like an impressive array of fortifications on paper might not be used nearly as effectively in real life as it could be. Sure some Russian units are competent but I could see some break throughs meeting a lot less resistance after the first line than you might think due to poor coordination and planning.

He turned bc Russia gave him a top post initially just in the city of Kherson, and later, as the “governor” of the Kherson region, one of the “new territories” of the Russian Federation. Out of the four “new territories,” he was the most high profile because he was largely respected by the regional population pre-invasion.  Of course, everyone considered him a traitor afterwards.  But essentially, Russia liked him bc he had clout and was amiable to their demands.

Bc he was a collaborator, he immediately became a target, and the GRU started protecting him.  He thus began to trust the GRU (Russian military intelligence), and regarding the financial coffers of Kherson—municipal funds, pensions, state accounts, pharmacy funds, contract funds, etc.—he allowed the access to be guarded by the GRU rather than the FSB.  This angered the FSB, who see themselves as superior, and when the FSB was unsuccessful in getting any of the traitors-deputies to turn their allegiance towards them and give them access, they poisoned Saldo.  It ended up being a *very* big deal—he was flown to Moscow, extensive tests and treatments were performed, and it came to light he was poisoned by the FSB, the FSB regional command was pulled—that episode was a contributing factor spurring Gerasimov to seek and gain permission to withdraw from the Right Bank of Kherson, entirely. 

Saldo stayed in Russia for months, recuperating, and the fake-administration moved to Genichesk, the southern tip of Kherson Oblast, where the various collaborators have continued to be successfully targeted.  Saldo eventually moved to Crimea, the Russians still considered him the “head” of the “new territory.”  He’s on the Russian-controlled regional television, often, and his statements are regularly published as the local authority bc he’s considered the “governor.”

He’s been the target of Atesh^* for many, many months.  They taunt him relentlessly. Saldo is constantly ‘on the move,’ so he doesn’t end up like one of his many deputies have—most killed via car bombed, a couple shot, the highest ranked deputy was rammed by a military vehicle and then shot and that one Atesh claimed responsibility for.  Atesh is constantly on Saldo’s trail, but apparently not quick enough, because by the time they get the info, he’s often gone.  They taunt him by publishing his new car license plate number, his new temp address, the intersections he passes, where he dined, etc.  They must’ve gotten the intel in time this time! 

____

^* ^(Atesh—which means *fire* in multiple languages, including Crimean Tatar—purports to be a Crimean Resistance movement, made up initially of Crimeans—both Russian ethnicity and Crimean Tatar—who don’t/didn’t want to be mobilized, or even occupied, and instead sabotage ‘from within.’  It spread, now is all along the Sea of Azov, including Mariupol, and in Russia.  They publish videos of how to sabotage Russian equipment and artillery, and claim to pay you if you send videos of doing so.  They put enormous bounties on the heads of certain people, including Saldo.  They publish evidence of transferring funds to anonymous accounts who’ve shown they sabotaged equipment or killed fellow Russian soldiers.  They claim to be responsible for numerous poisonings of Russian servicemen in the Crimean hospitals, publishing their names, rank, etc afterwards.   ... It is my personal opinion that all this is a GUR operation—Ukrainian military intelligence.  No Crimean has this kind of money that they can constantly be handing over, the Tatar people are repressed and not wealthy, bc the occupiers have stolen it.  And the Russians who live there are corrupt.  And besides, all the other such channels *ask for* money, not hand it out.)",1686423836.0,1686423222.0,t3_145pxsg,t1_jnohajy,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

There are points either way, a shotgun type system has more margin for error and is probably easier to implement with less collateral damage. Downside is going to be lethal range and custom components. 

A light machine rifle type system serves more purposes than strictly anti-drone and can probably leverage more logistics and existing tech, but requires a lot more precision and has more down range risk.

Traditional 'anti-tank guns' get replaced with recoilless rifle systems leveraging shaped charges - which started to come online in the later half of WW2 but the I'd wager the transition happened mostly in the 50's.

Afterwards, near the end of the 1950's the 'anti-tank gun' becomes manually guided (with a little joystick) ATGM systems which fill the role and get better generation by generation until we end up with modern SACLOS ATGM systems like Stugna-P, and even fire and forget MANPATS like Javalin & Spike. I can see these systems being... supported (not supplanted) with FPV suicide drones carrying a shaped charge.

The biggest change is definitely the mass deployment of commercial drones (or developments of commercial tech to produce a military drone such as the Ukrainian R18) dropping modified RKG shaped charged hand grenades by adding 3D printed fins. Unless and until we see autocannons or laser based systems with Electrooptical / radar tracking anti-drone systems become common across the battlefield I expect to see these drones more and more.

I'm not saying they are knocking out more tanks than ATGM or guided artillery (almost certainly not) - but I'm willing to bet they have a devastating impact on vehicle recovery rates for the opposition. 

In WW2 you hit a mine 10 kilometers from the front line - as long as some sneaky artillery spotter doesn't see you and you aren't strafed by enemy air power (very unlikely) then almost certainly the vehicle is recovered and pressed back into service even the same day.

Now in Ukraine if you hit a mine or throw a track some kilometers from the front line - the odds that a drone with a thermal camera will spot you and your condition is not insignificant. 

The drone operators can coordinate with command and deliver accurate artillery fire - or better yet organically deploy their own commercial drone equipped with a handful of RKG grenades assuming the crew was smart and shut the hatches (if the hatches are left open even a couple normal grenades will burn the vehicle it turns out) and flip the mobility kill into a hunk of unrecoverable slag (for a mere $10,000-$20,000 re-usable platform).

Euromaidan was a fight against a government who was trying to be tyrannical- half the country was helping the protesters. No one would be helping Russians that protests inside the country because the government has already been tyrannical for decades and all opposition has been eliminated.

Iran was impressive, but was due to Iranians themselves suffering, how are Russians suffering so far? The war is still not affecting them personally beyond worse economic situation and small risk of being drafted. Plus - where is the result of Iranian protests? Tiananmen got everyone involved killed - Russians would have to be extremely desperate to take such a step. Myanmar is more similar to Euromaidan - there are actually forces inside Myanmar to rally with.

 It's also general psychology - Russian government has conditioned an outsourcing of political power from the people to his government. I.e. you have no power to change anything and I will crush you if you try to challenge me - but I'll give you good economy and leave you alone as a result.

> The Ukrainian military has been fighting a difficult war against the Russian forces. They’ve been using tanks and artillery to great effect in their offensive, but the Russians have been putting up a strong resistance. The Ukrainian forces have suffered heavy losses, but they’re still determined to keep fighting. They know that every day counts and they’re doing everything they can to push the Russians back. The Western forces say they want to help, but NATO doesn’t seem to be taking any action. The Ukrainian military is getting desperate and they need more help on the front lines. They’ve already lost a few tanks and every day they’re getting destroyed. It’s really a lot for them to take on by themselves, but they’re determined to keep fighting until they’ve got the victory. The Ukrainian military knows that they can’t do this alone and they’re calling on every able-bodied man and woman to join them in their fight. They need every soldier they can get if they’re going to win this war.

We firmly hold the heights - the enemy took several positions in the lowland, which we mercilessly water with art and other firepower, preventing the enemy from feeling at least confident there. Nevertheless, the occupied pieces of territory (extremely not significant, we repeat) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to use to organize a bridgehead in order to further push our defense and advance to the South. So far, the gunners are quite coping with the task - not allowing the enemy to bring serious reserves and form a strike fist. But these preventive measures directly depend on the number of BC, which has unchanged properties - as we all already know from the situation as a whole - will end at some point. We very much hope that the high command will ensure adequate and most importantly timely logistics of ammunition delivery. So far, there is no reason for serious concern.

Although not seen in this conflict there are already active protection systems that can shoot down incoming projectiles like the Trophy system. I assume you could adapt them to shoot down incoming drones, they might already have been adapted to do so for all we know even though they would be overkill for something as fragile as a drone. Every new Abrams made or refitted to current standards is getting a Trophy system for instance.

https://youtu.be/6aA9HsmLHBQ?t=60
 
Now you could use a smaller caliber weapon that uses guided tracking to hit its target, so a mini Gepard, or the US hopes with lasers. That way as long as you have electricity and can manage the heat you don't have to worry about ammo. Most of these drones are quite fragile as they need to be as light as possible for range and to pack a decent size warhead, unlike an armored target they are susceptible to the kind of damage a laser could do up close.

As has been pointed out by many experts when used effectively in combination with infantry and other weapon systems tanks still have utility on the battlefield because to take a position you need to physically assault it. To do that you need to attack, when attacking you need to make it to the position first and then be able to do damage to a fortified position. So you need an armored box with a big boom... and the tank is born. You keep ending up with the need for armored vehicles like armored personal carries and tanks to protect the men and weapons you want to use against the position.

The history of arms developed has always been a punch counter punch type of thing where a new development is then countered rendering it less effective than initially feared. Back in the 60's/70's as ATGM's became operational the death of the tank was also forecasted, defenses were upped, tanks got more armor and active protection systems were developed. Before that the death of the tank was predicated before world war 2 when man portable anti tank systems like the Panzerfaust and Bazooka were developed. The same thing is already happening for drones, maybe the drones outpace the countermeasure systems or maybe they don't but it is way to early to call time on the tank yet. As long as fortified enemy positions need to be taken having a tank suddenly becomes a need. Maybe they should be unmanned long term but I wouldn't count them as out just yet.",False,1686429217.0,t3_145pxsg,t1_jnp38a1,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Active protection systems are not new - but they are an expensive and sensitive technology. We have to keep in mind that with little exception (such as the GLSDB) Ukraine is fighting Russia with equipment that is at least one generation old.

Some of these APS systems are designed to shatter an incoming APFSDS dart screaming in at 1,600 meters per second. They won't have any problem swatting down a slow drone, or even a squadron of them.
