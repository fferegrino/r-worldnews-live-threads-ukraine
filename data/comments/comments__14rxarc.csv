Military formations drawn from across Russia are currently bearing the brunt of Ukraine’s counter offensive.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the 58th Combined Arms Army is defending heavily entrenched lines; normally it secures Russia’s volatile Caucasus region.

Around Velyka Novosilka, the 5th Combined Arms Army and Naval Infantry hold the front; they are routinely based 7000km away as a balance to Chinese power.

Around Bakhmut, the defence is now largely formed around airborne regiments normally stationed in western Russia, who normally act as an elite rapid reaction force in case of tensions with NATO.

The way Russia is accepting risks across Eurasia highlights how the war has dislocated Russia’s established national strategy.

EUROPEAN PRAVDA — THURSDAY, 6 JULY 2023, 17:37

Ukraine is close to reaching an agreement with Bulgaria about the purchase of two Russian-made nuclear reactors and other critical energy equipment.

Source: The Wall Street Journal, referring to the officials familiar with the situation, as European Pravda reported 

Details: The negotiations concerning the agreement are ongoing. According to the agreement, the Bulgarian state-owned energy company NEK will sell the equipment worth at least €600 million from the unfinished Belene NPP to the Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom.

Since it will be hard for Ukraine to afford this purchase, one of the options discussed by the Bulgarian and American officials is that the US may make its contribution in the form of aid for Ukraine.

Another payment option is also being considered: Bulgaria may receive a minority share in Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyi NPP, where the equipment will be installed.

On 6 July, the Bulgarian parliament adopted a decision that obliged the Bulgarian government to hold negotiations with Kyiv about the sale of the plant. WSJ, referring to unnamed sources, reported that the agreement, which had been prepared for several weeks, was kept secret in order to prevent pro-Russian Bulgarian politicians from blocking it.

The works at the Belene NPP have been halted and resumed several times since the 1980s. The Western governments criticised the project due to its technical and commercial faults in connection with being dependent on Russian fuel. Gigawatt aquatic BBEP-1000 reactors were installed at the power plant. The same reactors were also installed at two power units of the Khmelnytskyi NPP, which have been commissioned.""

Kyiv has been pushing for the controversial and widely banned type of weapon, but Washington has resisted because of its potential to cause indiscriminate harm to civilians.

The Cluster Munition Coalition said in its annual report last summer that cluster munitions had killed at least 689 people in just the first six months of fighting.  
>  
>While the exact number of the weapons used in the conflict is difficult to know, hundreds have been documented and reported in Ukraine, mostly in populated areas, the group Human Rights Watch said in a May 2023 report.

ALONA MAZURENKO — THURSDAY, 6 JULY 2023, 17:25

One of the employees of the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP, who still works at the station, said on the condition of anonymity that the Russian military continues to increase its presence at the station and fortify itself as if preparing for battle.

Source: an employee who still works at Zaporizhzhia NPP in an interview with Suspilne

Quote: ""On the roofs of the buildings, along the perimeter of the station, fire positions are set up. Their work on fortification is still ongoing, and there are no signs that they are going to leave from here yet.

The Russians were not as active before. First, they dug trenches around the industrial site, closer to the city. As a non-military person, I think it was more to keep them busy.

Now they do it more technologically – they set fire points inside the premises of the station, and it looks as if they are going to fight there. But perhaps this is also due to the fact that they have nothing to do. They could sabotage it; no one can stop them. But it does not look like preparation for sabotage because they are fortifying [the plant] as if for a battle."" 

Details: According to the employee of the ZNNP, the behaviour of the Russians has not changed: ""They are present at the station, living on the premises, storing a lot of weapons, equipment appears and disappears, there are many trucks and it is unknown what they contain.""

He added that the risk of undermining something at the station existed from the moment of the seizure: ""However, from the point of view of the environmental threat, the risks are even lower now that the station is not working. And they could have damaged the station a year ago same as today.""""

In order to pay for the war the Russian government has also passed a number of taxes together and the price of ural oil means that oil profit is negligible.

In regards to the potential danger cluster munitions may pose I'd like to point out that most things that are designed to detonate with fatal results fit such a profile - anti vehicle and tank mines, which are designed to detonate when a vehicle drives over them (and even some when driven next to) as well as anti personnel mines, which are particularly adept in regards to maiming people... Also, I'd like to remind the press that the latter of the two is being deployed extensively, on Ukrainian soil by Russian forces.


>With those things said, the Department [of Defense] has conducted research into the situation and we've discovered that Russians have, thus far, have killed, or were responsible for the death of *more* Ukrainian civilians than any other factor.


>With this study, we have concluded that the risk unexploded cluster munitions may pose in the future is *far* less than the risk of Russians being allowed to occupy Ukraine.  In fact, our data shows that at *least* 9,081 Ukrainian civilians have been killed as of June, this year, and at least 27,385 wounded, since Russia's **second** invasion of Ukraine (in just the last 10 years - think about that!).  I mean, I don't know if you noticed, but they were targeting *hospitals*, even.


>Regardless, while cluster munitions can pose a risk, we've concluded that they will, over all, *greatly* reduce the risk Ukrainians would face if they were *not* to be used.  As such, we know, lives will be saved by them, which is why we are sending them.

>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday said Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the private Russian paramilitary unit of mercenaries Wagner Group, was in the Russian city of St. Petersburg. The whereabouts of has been a topic of speculation since he ended his short-lived mutiny on June 24. Lukashenko brokered a deal to end Wagner's armed rebellion in Russia. Under the agreement, Prigozhin was set to move to Belarus, and Lukashenko confirmed on June 27 that the Wagner chief had arrived in his country.   
What did Lukashenko say about Prigozhin?  
On Thursday, the Belarusian leader told reporters: ""As far as Prigozhin is concerned, he is in St. Petersburg. He is not in Belarus."" The Belarusian claimed that he know ""for ruse"" that Prigozhin was a free man, adding that he ""spoke to him on the phone yesterday."" Lukashenko's remarks came after Russian media reports said Prigozhin was spotted in St. Petersburg, with his presence in the second-largest Russian city seen as part of agreements allowing him to finalize his affairs there.   
What about Wagner fighters?  
Lukashenko said that Wagner troops still were at their camps, without specifying the location. He said their transfer to Belarus ""has not been decided,"" and that they had not set up a base in his country yet. Minsk's offer for Wagner to station some troops in Belarus is still standing, Lukashenko added, stressing that he did not believe the fighters would ever take up arms against his country. ""We are not building camps. We offered them several former military camps that were used in Soviet times, including near Asipovichy, if they agree,"" he said, referring to the town 103 kilometers (64 miles) away from Minsk. ""But Wagner has a different vision for deployment, of course, I won't tell you about this vision,"" he added.

This doesn't require some vast conspiracy.  It simply requires cunning vindictive people to be cunning and vindictive.  In fact, the likeliest kompromat that Prigozhin would have is any duplicate copy of kompromat that Putin has.  If Prigozhin releases that material, a bunch of people will turn on Putin.

It's an obvious explanation that doesn't require a bunch of complicated gyrations.

One for the nuclear stuff, and one for the water.

When a reactor gets shut down, whether it's in hot or cold shutdown, they stop the reaction, but there's still radioactive decay, which is why it requires passive cooling for longer. In cold shutdown, they just let it cool down, so it can't even boil the water to continue generating power. But in hot shutdown, they at least keep the fuel pressurized and hot enough to boil water. So even though it can't generate a *lot* of energy, it can still be used to keep things running at the plant.

>all they can build is some 50 year old Sowjetunion garbage and even that they can only do in low numbers

You think the amount destroyed means that new items aren't getting made?
