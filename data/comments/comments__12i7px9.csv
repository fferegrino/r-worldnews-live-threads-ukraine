The Russian economy is facing a shortage of workers, Putin said. ""Taking into account the historically minimal unemployment rate of 3.5% in the country as a whole, there are simply not enough workers in many areas,"" the president complained. 

After the mass mobilization, which affected 300,000 able-bodied men and caused almost a million more Russian citizens to flee abroad, the Ministry of Economic Development recorded a labor shortage in Russia of 600,000 people. And the so-called ""historically minimal unemployment rate"" is related to the same conscription for the war and the payment of permanent benefits from the state.

""On the US government's alleged wiretapping, the defence ministers of the two countries agreed that 'a considerable amount' of the documents were fabricated"", a statement said.

This did not specify whether South Korea thinks only the documents about its own country are fabricated, or the leak in its entirety.

There have been conflicting reports about the authenticity of the documents, which allegedly first emerged on the social media website Discord.

They give a month-old snippet of the war in Ukraine, and allegedly detail spying on the part of US intelligence towards Ukraine and South Korea.

6c931c12a26c1af3ffccb07696012496,12i7px9,jfwumed,"People keep doubting Ukraine‚Äôs ability to pull off an offensive, especially after announcing it. I know what doubters are thinking: Kherson, which the Ukrainians loudly telegraphed. While they ultimately won, it was a long and grinding struggle even though they had a significant advantage. Won‚Äôt the southern offensive be destined to fail? I‚Äôm arguing it won‚Äôt, and it all comes down to the quality of the forces: 

1. Equipment: unlike Kherson, Ukraine will be attacking with the best weapons it‚Äôs ever laid its hands on: lethal and survivable IFVs, specialized mine-clearing equipment, highly mobile howitzers, and of course the NATO MBTs. This is on top of the numerous Soviet gear donated/captured from earlier, which will make for a potent offensive punch. A parallel could be seen in the Kharkiv counteroffensive, where some western equipment made its debut, such as the Pzh2000. Note that despite the deliveries, we haven‚Äôt seen much combat with this year‚Äôs NATO equipment yet. In addition, Ukraine has drone superiority, both qualitatively and quantitatively, a factor that will allow them to better sight shelling, harass Russian trenches, and disrupt enemy movement to and from the front. As for the Russians, they‚Äôre starting to lose in‚Ä¶

2. Artillery. While ammo dump explosions are largely a thing of the past, the Russian shell shortage has slowly been creeping into the forefront. All across the frontline, the shell gap is closing, with Ukrainian shelling even matching Russian shelling in some parts of the front. This is probably the most concerning development for the Russians, as an artillery parity favors Ukraine, given that Ukrainian artillery is far more accurate. This allows for more effective counterbattery fire, which further limits Russian artillery. With the consistently high artillery losses over the past few weeks, we may be seeing the Russian artillery death spiral playing out in real time. Interestingly enough, as Ukraine pushes south we may see the ammo dump cotton come back as formerly safe supply depots come into HIMARS range. Which won‚Äôt be great for Russian‚Ä¶ 

3. Morale: while opinions vary depending on what part of the frontline you visit, Ukrainian morale is undoubtedly superior. For the Russians, one reason why the Kherson defense was so stiff was because the line was heavily manned by VDV units, whom were both well-trained and well-motivated. However, through Kherson, Kremmina, and Bakhmut, those units have been chewed up and, similar to the 155th naval infantry near Vulhedar, are likely now a shadow of their former self. Who‚Äôs manning the lines now? Mobiks with limited combat experience and questionable training, with the only veterans likely being the survivors of the Vulhedar or Orikhiv campaigns, both of which were crushing Russian failures.  Contrast that with the Ukrainian assault brigades, which are made of an untested but highly motivated volunteer force laced with veterans from prior campaigns. These men and women will be fanatically focused on taking back their land, freeing their people, and exacting vengeance for their fallen comrades. 

Long story short, it won‚Äôt be easy overcoming the fortifications, but Ukraine is about to unleash 50,000 largely inexperienced but highly motivated, exceptionally-equipped and well-trained soldiers against a mostly inexperienced and dubiously-trained force with low morale and waning artillery support. I hope my optimism makes sense, and if it does, I hope I may share it with you.",False,1681265566.0,t3_12i7px9,t3_12i7px9,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

A Dutch soldier is active in Ukraine, as well as a small group of soldiers from other Western countries. The BBC reports this on the basis of one of the dozens of leaked documents from the Pentagon that have been in the news in recent days. According to the document, dated March 23, Western special forces from the United Kingdom (50 people), Latvia (17), France (15), the US (14) and thus also one person from the Netherlands are active in Ukraine. Where they operate and in what role, it is not clear from the document.  
The Dutch Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the document when asked.

Wild guesses and speculation...

Putin's fate depends on when a political ""tipping point"" has been surpassed. Given his grip on power, this might be hard to figure out. Generalized grumbling or anxiety over Putin isn't enough, and groups are not necessarily coalitions.

Prigozhin has always had a degree of ambition, and this could come across as being courageous for some folks in Putin's Russia. For other folks however, he will always be a ""rooster,"" or a ""social climber."" Prigozhin lacks the qualities that would draw in other groups (oligarchs/FSB/military) to back him.  

Prigozhin is the product of Putin. Putin's approval was necessary for Wagner to operate as an ""independent"" military entity.

Such videos of atrocities are for propaganda purposes. They are designed to maximise the chance of getting a response from people. It lets the Russians pretend they're tough, and most importantly to Russia, they hope it will either make others feel fearful or angry and in doing so that they will make mistakes. From the Russians perspective this is no different than goading an opponent into making a mistake or loosing their nerve.  

Yes, channelling and using emotions to keep you going is one thing, but from what I've read and heard from some Ukrainians as well as soldiers from past wars, they may tend towards feeling cold and disconnected. It's the only way they can keep functioning at their tasks in such terrible circumstances. Sure, soldiers will put on a brave face, but many will have that emotional disconnect underneath.  

Purely from a psychological perspective, that is how humans tend to cope in such critically traumatic circumstances.  

Speaking from personal experience of trauma and PTSD, not from a war I hasten to add, you can feel cold and emotionless as if you are running on pure cold logic. It may sometimes feel like an autopilot is operating you. You may feel disconnected as if in a bubble. Inside this bubble or sphere of personal space things feel like they move slowly, maybe even dreamlike. Outside the bubble things may feel like they are moving faster. The inside and outside may feel as if it is not in sync. It's a zoned out feeling. I'm told I can appear to be cold and emotionless while in that state.  

Even if I'm not in that state, in an emergency I can come across as cold and emotionless, as if running on pure logic. It's how things get done that must be done. It's also a take charge state. That state of being, acting and thinking has saved lives in past emergencies.  

Others I've spoken to over the years have had similar experiences. Those feelings are quite common amongst such people who have experienced high degrees of stress, trauma, life or death scenarios, including soldiers who have experienced active combat in wars, etc.

At that point intel is 100% about how to use this opportunity and how to catch those who did it. You might think the latter point is only applicable if the documents are real.. but its not.

Ukraine losing -- either openly losing or forced to negotiate a settlement giving Russia something they didn't have before the invasion, because the west failed to provide enough resources to fight -- will be noted, and the hell will break loose (or speaking in more neutral term, violent renegotiation of the current order will happen).",False,1681223719.0,t3_12i7px9,t1_jftx851,,2,14,0,14,0,0,

Everybody play the clock publicly, while the groundwork is (probably literally) done.

Then, build around that operation to train new pilots, test integrations, etc. It also solve the problem of official training by a foreign country, which seems to be far more sensible than tanks or infantry.

As long as those factions stay loyal, there isn't much chance for an organized move against Putin. The National Guard have the numbers to put down unrest, and the FSB may get in the news for their incompetence but that ignores all the successful operations that we don't hear about. 

My personal prediction is that top siloviki like Patrushev or Bortnikov will move against Putin when either the war or internal politics become untenable, and when it becomes a choice between removing Putin or letting the country fall apart. Right now, removing Putin would likely be too much of a shock to the population and politics and cause more trouble than it's worth, especially since in the cities and urban areas, Russians still largely haven't felt much negative effects of the war.  I think it's safe to bet, though, that if Ukraines counteroffensive hits Russia seriously hard, or if any kind of political shenanigans starts in Moscow, that the cost-benefit ratio of removing Putin will look real good to the top siloviki. 

If that happens, there will probably be a purge of dangerous figures - Putin loyalists, anyone who has serious ambitions on power without being part of the elite club (and neither Prigozhin nor Strelkin belong to that group). I imagine Mishustin will be allowed to step in as acting President according to law, as he is a technocrat with no personality or ambition, and he'll do what he's told.

The US has not denied anything else in the documents so far.

Increasingly, though, I also don't believe that the US faked the information in these documents. For one thing, if they leaked fabricated information in an attempt to trick Russia, that completely backfires when countries like South Korea hastily argue that it's fake. You'd need South Korea, Egypt, France, and other mentioned countries in the leaks, to all pretend that the information is accurate if your goal is to trick Russia.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,12i7px9,jfu8ip1,"Seriously guys. We're talking about the same military-intelligence apparatus that screwed the pooch with the Afghanistan pullout not even two years ago. Tens of thousands of vehicles, hundreds of thousands of weapons, and countless Afghani citizens who all get lost in the shuffle of a massive miscalculation. If you're coming at this from the POV of ""America's intelligence leadership simply doesn't make these kinds of gaffes,"" you don't watch any news.

Nor is it out of the question that the West has failed to properly arm Ukraine in time to deal with some of the issues detailed in the reports. The air defense deficit is a completely believable problem that experts have been talking about for nearly a year now. Just like with Afghanistan, the fact that alarm bells have been ringing about this problem for a while now, is absolutely not a guarantee that everyone in power throughout the complex web of NATO intelligence, military, and political offices, will actually get on the same page and figure out a solution in time. Sometimes the ball gets dropped, and sometimes it's a big fucking ball that gets a lot of people killed.

The thing about these documents is that they are not plausibly going to cause Russia to behave in a fashion that could benefit Ukraine or the US. OK fine, they hear that Ukraine is dangerously low on AA munitions. How do you think Russia will respond to that? Are they going to just assume the leak is 100% true with no testing or probing whatsoever, and throw their entire airforce headlong into a trap? Of course not. They will just incrementally ramp up air strikes until it is clear one way or the other that Ukraine either does or does not have the ability to respond. For this trap to work, Ukraine would have to be willing to sacrifice thousands and thousands of soldiers and hundreds of armored vehicles to successful Russian strikes.

How about the other stuff? Russia is led to believe that Egypt was secretly going to funnel 40,000 missiles to Russia. Russia would already know that was going to happen if that plan is real. If Russia didn't know about it, then obviously it's a fake leak, and Russia won't do anything about it. How will it cause Russia to do anything that hurts Russia? Will they call up the Egyptian president and see if he's seriously willing to consider doing this? OK fine, they call him up, and he says nope, sorry, I'm not doing this. How does that hurt Russia, at all?

Maybe you think Russia will think the counteroffensive isn't a serious threat so they stop fortifying the south. Except... they have been fortifying the south for 6+ months now, with no sign of slowing down. They've supposedly had this intel for about a month now, and they're still mining and entrenching the south.

If the intel report is to be believed, the Ukrainian logistics network is only a few months away from crumbling due to lack of ammunition, especially lack of effective ability to guard against Russian airstrikes. If that is true, then why the fuck would it cause Russia to *ramp up* its infantry human wave tactics? From Russia's perspectives, the response to this intel is simple: Hunker down, wait Ukraine out, and keep exhausting their air defense missiles while you quietly guard the southern front against a Ukrainian tank push. Once the Ukrainian tank push happens, murder it with surprise air strikes, and enjoy the huge morale hit this does to Ukraine in the Western public sphere.

You know what these leaks are *not* going to cause Russia to do? Heedlessly double-down on Bakhmut. Because if the leaks are true, Bakhmut just became a pointless political objective for Russia. Instead of attacking Bakhmut, they can wait out Ukraine's ammunition problem and enjoy a much, much easier time waltzing through the poorly defended countryside this summer or fall.

Russia's always going to evaluate reports of leaks with a skeptical eye, because you can't afford to believe anything 100% with no qualification. There has been a *ton* of discourse questioning whether these leaks are in fact real, and Russian leaders are watching that discourse and trying to do what they can to double-check it against their internal intelligence. They're not just going to laugh and say ""OK cool, we can stop trying.""",1681228049.0,1681227601.0,t3_12i7px9,t1_jfu5zy9,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

So as far as how it serves US or Ukraine interests, most directly if forces Egypt and quite literally anyone else thinking about sending covert shipments of toilet paper to Russia to back way off of that plan I go shoot some hoops or something instead. notice no double agents or informants or technical details were revealed, which means now everyone is thinking theyre plans both past and future may show up on discord someday and they won't even know how. it absolutely resets the table for anyone scheming to finally put one over on uncle Sam. 

I also think that everyone the world over believes these documents to be real, the unedited ones, or the presumably original ones, regardless of what they actually are. this means all of the billions and billions spent so far on this war to manipulate the information space is now in direct competition with supposedly highly accurate data. so again this leak sets the table for the war for the foreseeable future. no Russian or russia sympathizer with access to Russian millbloggers or just the internet currently believes any of Russia's numbers on troop or equipment losses over this data, again because it is presumed to be a real leak. Remember how we've been hearing for months how Putin doesn't get real info from his subordinates? well that's over now. there's no way Putin hasn't seen this leak. so consider for a moment you're a Russian soldier, one of the siloviki, or Putin himself. you're reading online from multiple sources or from your most trusted assistants of how the mod is so porous that the US has strike coordinates of your missiles. you're reading 200,000 russian casualties. would you come away from new glaringly real info like this with the idea that you're a competent super power that can win a war against NATO trained and supplied and financed troops? 

fuck no of course not. so again as far as serving US or Ukraine interests it absolutely sows insecurity in Russia and in the Russian military both within their ranks and internationally. it makes recruiting harder. it makes international deal making harder. it makes everything much harder.

I do not have any true knowledge as to whether this leak was intentional, but I'm certain, very certain that it's impact is a huge net positive for Ukraine. No world leader out there not already aligned with Russia directly in the shit is going to so much as answer an international call from them until this is over.

No. The Soviet occupiers were considered by far the worst of the 4 allies. Besides the rapes they stole almost everything.

Nobody in Austria is nostalgic towards the Soviet occupiers.

The close relationship developed later.

They started importing Russian gas in the 60s when the first pipeline was opened.

But when it really started was after the collaps of the UDSSR. Because Austria stayed neutral during the Cold War and because of historic ties from the Habsburg monarchy, Austrian companies expanded massively into the new markets in Eastern Europe, when other western companies were still much more cautious.

So this was mostly driven by business interest, Austrian companies made a ton of money in the East, including Russia, which also affected political decisions.

I tend to be a little flippant in these threads lest every post turn into a dissertation, but I think the fact that the western contribution to the Ukranian war effort is being funded with a essentially peacetime budget is an important point for the things we do take away from the current conflict. 

Correct me if I am wrong here, but the Ukraine Aid spending was sub-6% of the 3.5% that the US spends on defense.   As such, while spending is beginning to trend up on the whole, the US contributions to the Ukrainian war effort are being funded with a basically peacetime budget. While the US isn't the manufacturing powerhouse that it was 80 years ago, both the scheduled 4x increase in artillery shell production over the next year, and more distantly our capacity to (given a nearly blank check) to push out the coronavirus vaccines in <1 year indicates to me that that there is still sufficient infrastructure and technical expertise left for said industries to be capable of absorb large sudden influxes of resources and generate results vaguely commensurate with the investment.

I don't know what the DoD's budget is going to look like if/when another nation-state makes a serious attack against US territory/forces, but I have more faith in our ability to do useful work with that added funding than I did 5 years ago. I also doubt we will ever see that sustained level of funding again, because I think wars at the US near-peer level have gotten *much more* technical and decisive since then. Stockpiles are relatively more important and production somewhat less important. I don't think a lot of the lessons of Ukraine are directly applicable to those calculations, but it likely does make us feel understocked in the general sense and especially in the contingency where neither side attains air superiority quickly.",False,1681278686.0,t3_12i7px9,t1_jfx8cc8,,6,3,0,3,0,0,

They had to overthrow a very long colonial oppression model from the British in the 1950s, and then the US and market capitalism came in during the Cold War and helped prop up Israel.

In this regard aid to Ukraine isn‚Äôt even a detraction from US military capabilities. 

As for production capabilities the US is still likely getting an insane return on investment because the weapons they make are actively weakening one of their staunchest rivals. This will in turn allow the US to refocus on China if Russia is significantly weakened.

its editorialized fiction, that story. 

again, everyone believes it's a real breach, which is why it is so powerfully useful in undercutting counter info in the very real and very important information war. stories like this are adding to that narrative weight not detracting from it. The US or whoever leaked it absolutely needs for it to look like a mistake so that the info it contains is viewed as valid. it's the reason Russia looks incompetent within Russia right now. we couldn't reach them with counter news in their closed information space. but this supposed breach cut through that. 

who else would leak it? like what other state government? certainly no friend of Russia would put this out. they look incompetent. maybe Ukraine would. maybe the US would have Ukraine leak it. I really don't know. but I know stories like what you linked are just hyperbole until we actually see damage done. there's no sources revealed. there's no methods revealed. a generic designator for a wiretap reveals nothing. what the article implies is that it might reveal methods. I can imply that too. and beyond that none of us know what the US might be willing to sacrifice by way of intelligence. everyone automatically assumes the US doesn't want to burn their seemingly endless inroads into the mod when we don't actually know what they've given up and what more they have access to that they haven't given up. because we don't know those things all we can do is actually look at the fallout. time will tell I suppose but I see Russia looking like a shadow of the version we all perceived them to be just two years ago. and while many of us here in the west have known for some time that Russia was starting to look held together by duct tape this leak clarifies that for the whole world.",1681245891.0,1681244244.0,t3_12i7px9,t1_jfvev8h,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
