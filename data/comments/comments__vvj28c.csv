Day 137 of my updates from Kharkiv.

For the second day in a row, the missile strike happened at 3:30am, if this is their new schedule, then it sucks. They fired 4 missiles in total, 3 of them managed to get through and we don’t know what happened to the last missile. We know what was hit with one of the missiles, it landed somewhere in the middle of the city and destroyed a 6-storey residential building, the number of casualties is currently unknown, but we do know that one person has been rescued from under the rubble.

This is the second residential building destroyed by Russians today, the one in Chasiv Yar was hit by 2 missiles which killed at least 15 people. Now they hit another one here in Kharkiv, I really hope there are no casualties, but we won’t know until later in the day. What do they hope to achieve by doing this? Their missile strikes just don’t make any sense. Yesterday the missile strike destroyed yet another school, and for what purpose? Maybe they are destroying all the schools, because a school is what they would use as an ammo dump themselves, so they are just projecting?

While they are continuing their war against schools, their ammo dumps and bases continue to blow up every day. There are so many strikes happening that it is pretty hard to count them all. Just today their Rosguard base in Kherson blew up, then an ammo dump in Nova Kakhovka also blew up, then another one in Luhansk, apparently their barracks were also hit. And at the same time all they do is waste their missiles on civilians, if they think that they can make us surrender by killing civilians then they are dead wrong.",False,1657505933.0,t3_vvj28c,t3_vvj28c,,0,88,0,88,1,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 10 July 2022
 
- Russian artillery continues to strike the Sloviansk area of the Donbas from around Izium to the north and near Lysychansk to the east. Russian forces have likely made some further small territorial advances around Popasna.

- Fires from Izium continue to focus along the axis of the E40 main road. Control of the E40, which links Donetsk to Kharkiv, is likely to be an important objective for Russia as it attempts to advance through Donetsk Oblast.

Synegubov noted that Russian missiles fired from Russian territory arrive in 30-40 seconds due to the proximity of the city to the border.

Yes. Just recently here's 6 taken out Russian tanks. But depends on what you mean by ""big part"". At the first phase Russia were just driving convoys of tanks without proper infantry support and not expecting a lot of resistance. So you don't really see the same type of constant tank convoys getting artied or ambushed but tanks are still the central tool used in pushes. This time they'll just use a lot more arty before moving in. They still also get blown up a lot but just not in the same quantity daily.

I am looking forward to reading books with analysis of the current conflict.  What we see is heavily influenced by who carries cameras.  We saw lots of tanks rolling into areas with civilians carrying cell phones in the early part of the war.  Extra effort was made getting video of missiles shooting at tanks because Ukrainian camera crews wanted the west to send more anti-tank missiles.

The moment Russia formerly declares war and starts drafting people to fight and requisitioning companies to make war materiel is the moment they have to admit the conflict in Ukraine is not going well and they need to start taking it seriously.

It's important to remember that many of the people in Russia view the conflict as small. The official death tolls released by the government are very light compared to the likely reality and most believe Russia is winning, and would have won already if we the west had not intervened. 

Now not all Russia's are this gullible, plenty are very much aware that things are much worse than the government is implying, but this group was cracked down on by the central government early in the war, so they can't influence public opinion as much.

It's also important to remember that most of the Russian forces in Ukraine are not from the large metropolitan areas in western Russia like St Petersburg and Moscow where the governments base of power lines, but are from the more rural regions of Russia such as Siberia, the caucuses, and eastern Russia. This not only keeps those people in the cities ignorant of the wars cost but makes it harder for large scale protests to form. 

If a general mobilization were introduced, that means those people living in those seats of power will have to give up their sons and fathers to the war machine. When they don't comeback, even Putin's advocates will start asking questions. 

Combine that with the country switching to total war mode, and it will become obvious to anybody that the war is not going well. Ukraine was suppose to be weak, a push over, and now your telling them that everybody is needed for the war effort? Even a blind nationalist could see something is wrong.

Plenty of Russians are willing to root for the war so long as it's not them or their kin going to fight. Once the war starts affecting their lives directly, they might start questioning why it needed to happen in the first place, and more critically, why their leader thought it was a good idea.

As such, full mobilization is a last resort. Once it starts Russia would have a limited time to win the war before those people in the seats of power start pushing back against the war, start asking where their sons are, and start asking why Putin is in charge. Not to mention if Russia fully commits to the war and sends the bulk of it's military, who will be left to put down the protests? 

At the moment, Russia is still managing to find troops to throw into the meat grinder by pulling troops from less critical locations, offering better service contracts to conscripts, and draining their training officers for troops, but it won't take long before they need more soldiers.

Pilots are are selected for intelligence, and training takes long enough that their frontal cortex is fully developed.  The proportion of pilots with enough functioning neurons to avoid volunteering to test-drive an ejection seat at mach 2 is likely much higher than those getting press-gained into the turret-tossing contest going on down below.

Second, Russia is flying exactly the same equipment as Ukraine. Oops... IFF is a real *operational* problem for them. It takes a lot of coordination in very short time-spans for Russian air-defense not to mistake a returning Russian plane as inbound Ukrainian strike.  And even a young, trigger-happy air-defense operator with even a barely developed frontal cortex is smart enough to know it's better to err on the surviving side of any mistake that's going to be made.  My guess is that Russia lost a lot of returning sorties this way.  This likely contributes in no small way to the logic of pilots with fully functioning frontal cortexes. See #1.

Third, Ukraine still has a very serviceable air-defence *network*, with solid comms and accurate intelligence that likely knows when every toilet flushes on Russia's airbases.  Russia has to rely on mobile air-defence systems, communicating by walkie-talks, between systems manned by people stupid enough to volunteer their way into a conflict zone.  If you are dumb enough to fly, and you can survive friendly fire, you still have to navigate a fully-functional air-defence network. And many who mistakenly think they can, don't.

The combination of #1, #2, and #3 together presents a Darwinian selection bias against folks who lack the intelligence to decline to volunteer to fly offensive missions.   And a decline in the number of serviceable planes they can strap around them.   Which leads to increasing scarcity of both of these militarily precious assets, and a reluctance to use them.

The British training for Ukrainian's is 4 months and that's their compressed version so probably what they identify as the bare minimum of time required before putting someone into combat. In comparison for peace time in the US you'd do 10 weeks in basic and then 14 weeks more of infantry training, so around six months.

784b805a8b81e1a3284a3c2a9975d55a,vvj28c,ifleoju,"Igor Girkin is a Russian armed forces veteran, FSB officer and war criminal. He's been involved in pro-Russian fighting in Transnistria, Bosnia and Chechnya.

He was a commander that played a vital part in taking over Crimea in 2014 and later joined the Donbas to lead the terrorist states as their ""supreme commander"" until the MH-17 civilian airplane got shot down on his watch after which he got the boot.

Since then he's been a commentator on the war with close connections to the DPR / LPR forces with a very negative tone. He's still very loyal to Russia and has imperialist dreams but he thinks Russia is being incompetent in the conflict. His most common complaint is that Russia needs to go to proper war and [mobilize](https://i.imgur.com/hOUZ1z8.png) (or more clearly that they should've done this way back in time).

Some say the reason he's allowed to criticize the Russian army this way is because he has too good connections and some type of kompromat or kill-switch to release hurtful things while others claim he's controlled opposition because he still might have connections to the Kremlin and all of his doomer rants aside he's very loyal.

So people on the pro-Ukraine side likes his negative commentary obviously but he's also been very open with his war crimes and how [cynical](https://i.imgur.com/rbYnk6Z.jpg) the entire operation in Crimea and Donbas have been rather than the propaganda image Russia conveys. Also while he might be biased his reporting is probably the most credible and honest we're getting from the Russian side. As far as I know there's been no big lies about the conflict and he was as an example the first to reveal that something had happened with the big river crossing defeat days before Ukraine revealed the results.

Yes, exactly.

All it takes for bad things to happen is for good people to do nothing.

I disagree that learned helplessness is the perpetuating factor though.

Learned helplessness is not a collective thing. It’s is an individual thing.

Each individual in each generation of Russians make their own choice.

The stabilising forces in Russia are poverty and inequity.

In Russia, every generation has been ground down by the rich cities in Western Russia stealing from the rest of Russia to make themselves rich. 

The country gets divided into the rich and the impoverished. There is no middle class.

The rich have incentive to keep the rest of the country under their thumb. The poor have no options.

No one has an incentive to change anything.

It’s been the same with the tsars. It was at its least in the USSR, but Stalin fixed that. It’s been possibly at its worst for the last 20 years.

It’s the middle class that drives change in a country. Russia has never had one.

Ultimately, this will not change until Russia breaks up, or the people grow some balls and demand an equitable country.

It’s rapid growth is also its weakness. 

It leaves China vulnerable in two ways.

Firstly, Russia and China have something very critical in common. They don’t seem to have learnt the lessons of WWII.

The lesson is very simple. Don’t wage war on the basis of race.

In the most dry terms, defining your country on the basis of race puts a hard boundary on what you can achieve. Your neighbours react badly to you if you commit genocide.

The Han Chinese are 90% of China. They are a very loyal and hard working race. Do they have the intelligence to think and see beyond their own borders clearly?

At the moment they seem to have an us vs them mentality to the world.

The US is a superpower and it has the largest military by far. However, it’s real strength is it’s allies. While it will often be brutal in business, at the end of the day it is mostly respectful to its allies.

China is yet to display that ability.

The second issue is what I’ve alluded to before. Chinas sudden increase in wealth is in itself destabilising. It is yet to be seen what will happen as it’s general population becomes more wealthy, more informed and more educated.

To date China seems to be trying to deal with this by increasing restrictions on information and personal liberty. It is doubtful that this approach alone will lead to long term stability.

China has a long way to go.",False,1657452839.0,t3_vvj28c,t1_ifkz502,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

I don’t give a fuck what you think is objective when you think that such an invasion ground to a halt is anything but an embarrassment. It’s moving the goal posts avant la lettre. Saying “acquire” doesn’t hide the cost that the brutal losses represent, and only try to obfuscate the strategic ineptitude. 

A country as big and rich in resources as Russia should be the wealthiest and most influential country in the world. As far removed from that as it is, is nothing but a loss. Geo-politically.

Sorry pal life is not a fairy tale where good guys have to win and bad guys always lose. I have never said Russia performed well but you keep bringing this up as if lost territory and terms of surrender are up for debate. Finland lost territory and diplomatic opportunities for decades due to Russia. Ukraine is suffering and is likely to lose some land due to Russia. I also wish this was a nice book where Russia just fails miserably at everything and is completely kicked out within a month with 100k casualties and sanctions on top of that but sadly life isn’t written like a nice bed time story.

Sri Lanka’s issue is the Government was grossly incompetent as well as being corrupt. So bad it got to the point that both China and India decided to let it go down.

The Sri Lankan government really has been doing lots of stupid crap. No one could have kept that shit show afloat.

The place now has 53% inflation because the government was printing money for the last couple of years to try to get out of trouble. Yep, that level of dumb.
