Thread locked before I could reply. You commented suggesting that Putin can't have more than 50% support since he needs to rig elections. 

Firstly, to point of my comment wasn't to say that the vast majority of the population support Putin - rather that the vast majority are not sufficiently anti-war to risk their lives in a protest. As I was explaining, the whole point of Russian propaganda is to create extreme apathy, disengagement, and skepticism of all media and politics. On one hand that makes it easy for Putin to have a free reign without much backlash, even if he makes unpopular decisions sometimes. On the other hand, it makes your voter turnouts incredibly low. When apathetic people are the majority, the only voters motivated enough to vote are going to be hardliners, old retirees with enough time, and  anti-Putin people, and that is too risky for Putin.",False,1669961183.0,t3_zaarcj,t3_zaarcj,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

There were so many talks in spring that Russia is done after December because EU will ban all oil imports from Russia by sea. But presumably this announced price cap will hardly make a difference.

Some other disappointing points:

The more blatant it is that the something is a lie the better: the obvious lie pisses Liberals off more than a strong truthful rebuttal would.

This oft-cited quote from Jean-Paul Sartre I believe sums it up the best:

“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

So, when defending you create three lines; a lightly manned front line; a heavily manned second line; and a massively manned third line.  

The openening artillery barrage destroys the first line, but that's why there weren't many people there.  The second line is the 'main line of resistance' but is far enough back that the intial artillery attack can't do much damage.  This is where most the killing happens.

Finally, a reaction force is in the third trench line, and their job is to counter attack and take retake the 1st, and occasionally 2nd, trench line.  Because the newly captured positions can't be protected from the defender's artillery any better than the first trench line was protected from the attacker's artillery.

The defenders open artillery, and counter attack, and we're all back where we started 15,000 men short of where we started.

Destroyed tanks, arty, planes and other multi ton machines are easy to verify whether or not they’ve been destroyed.

I cannot speak for the Ukrainian army but —

Injured or dying humans are difficult to confirm due to size and recon ability.

What about those injured and died later? Well, that’s going to be a best guess situation.

This isn’t a science and there will likely be no true accounting for the casualties. The Ukrainians may or may not be fluffing the numbers. Common sense would say they are to boost moral,   But the opposite may be true. Less reported kills to encourage more aid. THEN AGAIN, it may be in their interest to fluff the numbers to show how effective the aid is to encourage MORE aid.


Most likely they are reporting a little more than actually killed but we will never know.

It stopped making sense as soon as Izyum and Lyman were liberated by Ukraine.

They kept focusing on taking Bakhmut as if that victory would shift the whole momentum of the battlefield. 

While Russia focused on Bakhmut, Ukraine has kept chipping away in the north and also took out the initially strong Russian positions on the right bank of the Dnieper, again making Bakhmut even more pointless.

Line infantry warfare was developed for three reasons (1) firearms used properly could could trump any proceeding weapon system; (2) firearms produced lots of smoke; and (3) firearms, before rifeling, were WILDLY inaccurate.

Volley fire was the solution to problem (3); Line infantry formations with brightly colored uniforms were the solution to the problems of command and control that arose from issue (2); and the massed infantry gunpowder army was superior to anything else at the time because of issue (1).

Trench warfare arrises because when faced with repeating rifles the only way a soldier can stay alive is by getting below the grade of the ground.  The multi-tiered system arrises because over the horizon artillery can destroy any fixed position people know how to construct.  Finally if you don't have tanks, plains, and other mechanized forces to breach the 3rd defense line in time, the attacker faces a massive counter attack when they move beyond the cover of their own artillery into the cover of enemy artillery.

The misconception that people have about trench warfare is the preception given by mass media that most of the dying occurs when the attacking infantry leaves their trenches and face machine guns.  But, most the killing happens in massed artillery barrages before attacks are launched and by attacking forces that reach pulverized trenches filled with other shell shocked infantry who were just on the recieving end of massed artillery.

So the attacker in trench warfare gains the immediate balance of casualties, and both sides in trench warfare constantly attempt to stay on the tactical attack because of this.

Don't be ridiculous.

 >Syria has been an independent republic since 1946 after the expulsion of the French forces. For decades, the country was partially stable with a series of coups until the Ba'ath Party seized power in Syria in 1963 after a coup d'état. The head of state since 1971 has been a member of the Assad dynasty, beginning with Hafez al-Assad (1971–2000). Syria was under emergency law from the time of the 1963 Syrian coup d'état until 21 April 2011, when it was rescinded by Bashar al-Assad, Hafez's eldest surviving son and the current President of Syria.
