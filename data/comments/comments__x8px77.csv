Day 197 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the day started with shelling, when at 10am they shelled a couple of our districts from MLRS. They were aiming at civilians again, areas around apartment buildings were hit, there were no casualties in one district, but 2 people died, and 5 were injured in the other district. Later, at 2pm, our AA shot down something that was flying to the city, it might have been a missile, but we are not sure.

Then we were shelled again at 8:20pm, again from MLRS. Kyivskyi district was shelled, there were no casualties, but some private houses were damaged. They also shelled Chuhuiv at the same time, killing 1 person. A bit later, at 8:40pm, they did a missile strike, they launched 2 missiles, one of them malfunctioned yet again, and fell in Belgorod, the other missile landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, but not much else is known.

It‚Äôs so weird that even when their entire front is collapsing they are still using their resources to kill civilians, which won‚Äôt help them in any was at all. Well, actually if you read their official media, such as RIA Novosti, they are saying that they are, in fact, still in Balakliia, even though they haven‚Äôt been there at least since this morning. They are really good at denying reality, but it won‚Äôt help in combat.

Even Girkin is saying that our forces are in the vicinity of Kupiansk, and saying that they aren‚Äôt there won‚Äôt help them, it won‚Äôt magically move the frontline west. Russians even already moved their ‚Äútemporary Kharkiv oblast administration"" from Kupiansk to Vovchansk, which shows that they are not confident about defending it at all. But no, actually they are still controlling Balakliia, and there‚Äôs definitely no panic in Kupiansk.

He said he has so far **found no evidence** that **Ukraine planned to attack Russia** - something Moscow keeps claiming.

Among the documents captured by his troops after capturing Ukrainian positions, he said, he did not come across a single tactical document that envisaged acts of aggression.

>Russia launched its war of aggression against Ukraine on February 24. The Kremlin also justified the invasion by saying it needed to pre-empt an attack by the Ukrainian army on parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that had been breakaway since 2014. In addition, it said, Kiev had plans to attack the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. Ukraine has always denied such allegations.

Check out our [public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRbCobUuLC3gUJVvn9kZZyBV1x96g33CXapozBoDLHs/edit#gid=0) tracking contributions and shipments. We update it at least daily.

\- We shipped [our third shipment](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1567943961318412288) today! This brings us to a total of $5,598 in supplies shipped to Ukraine. You can track the packages in the spreadsheet linked above. Our first shipment is in International Transit, we're estimating another week or so to arrive. Our second shipment is still in the US and is in progress to the International facility.

\- FOX Chest Seals have dropped in price from $25 to $20! If you were on the fence about contributing, this is the cheapest yet one of the most desperately needed items.

If you can't afford all this (totally understandable) share the registry or [our fundraiser's tweet](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1566531914181120000) on the topic.

>...no panic

Translation from the screenshot in the tweet:

>Risk of catastrophe near Izyum. According to reports from the field, the enemy is advancing along the Shevchenko-Kupyansk line, and not only on Kunya. If he manages to take Kupyansk, then he can
successfully advance south along the P79 road, hiding from the left flank with a reservoir on the river. Oskol. At the same time, the Izyum group is completely cut off from the rest of the RF Armed Forces. Our troops will not be able to escape to the neighboring coast of Oskol. There are only two bridges, in Gorokhovatka and Senkovo, they are easy to destroy with the HIMARS MLRS. And our main reserves are far away, and it is simply unrealistic to transfer them quickly to the area needed for the counteroffensive within a reasonable time.
>The RF Armed Forces, in theory, have one ""Road of Life"" - through the settlement. Shard to the east. But for it, in a few hours, battles with the APU grouping from the Valley may begin.
>If those troops that are now available north of the Shevchenkovo-Kupyansk road do not perform a miracle in a couple of days, and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine have enough strength to complete the operation, and if the grouping that is now launching an attack from the Valley can cut the Oskol road
- Yatskovka, then Russia will face the most
heavy military defeat after the defeat near Kharkov in the winter of 1943. Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov are one step away from an unthinkable achievement - the strategic defeat of the RF Armed Forces by a deliberately weaker enemy with almost no aviation, and with their own aviation.
>No, actually there are still chances. Banal stubborn resistance on the ground can buy time to maneuver reserves.
But he may not be allowed to.
>Ukrainians may not have enough strength for such
maneuver. But for now it's enough.
It is possible that they provide a blow
applied to the north, and the main one on Kunya, to the south. But that doesn't change much. I wonder if they will report this to V. Putin?

Ukraine tricked Russia into redeploying all their best troops to defend Kherson/Crimea in the South.

Ukraine said ""hey, don't say anything about the counterattack in the south"" as they started probing all along the lines. The US said ""we wargamed this with Ukraine and advised them not to open up another front, but they got this one."" Russia flooded the area with men and armor, only for Ukraine to destroy all the bridges on the river, pinning them there.

Ukraine's been very slowly, methodically advancing in the south. There are a few small breakthroughs, where they gained a couple kilometers of land at best. The counteroffensive was starting to look more like a siege as it was obvious that Russia had reinforced heavily by sending all their guys into the area.

Then Ukraine attacked the northern front, on the opposite side of the country. That front is collapsing and Ukraine has gained 20km of land in about a day. It's possible that they're another 10-20km deep right now (won't be clear until tomorrow).

Russia now has a dilemma:

1. Pull out of the south and reinforce elsewhere (losing their political victory of Kherson)

2. Pull out of the east and reinforce the north (making them vulnerable to counterattacks)

3. Abandon the north and reinforce the east

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 8 September 2022


- In Kherson Oblast, Ukrainian brigades continue to conduct offensive operations. Ukraine has probably destroyed a military pontoon bridge at Darivka, which Russian forces had deployed after the nearby road bridge was severely damaged.

- The Darivka crossing is one of the main routes between the northern and southern sectors of Russia's military presence along the Dnipro river. Ukraine's systematic precision targeting of vulnerable crossing points likely continues to impose pressure on Russian forces as they attempt to contain Ukrainian attacks: it slows their ability to deploy operational reserves and resupply materiel from the east.",1662618009.0,1662617107.0,t3_x8px77,t3_x8px77,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

1. Ukraine has been anything but stupid in its tactics and strategy to date.

2. Ukraine would not want to liberate towns and settlements only to hand them back over to Russia by retreating.

3. There are sketchy reports of large numbers of Russian POWs. If this was a potential outcome a modern force would usually have the means to then process them.

I'm pretty hopeful thinking about this rapid advance, if they moved that quickly and far, they obviously saw an opening and had a plan to exploit it. That usually means follow-up as well.

For example, when USA gives Ukraine a billion dollars worth of equipment, it isn't the same as taking a billion dollars from USA's federal budget and giving it to Ukraine. The equipment given is from USA's vast stockpiles, the contents of which have been paid for already, sometimes decades ago. If they were not given to Ukraine, and there was not war where USA needs to use them, they would have eventually become obsolete or have decayed too far, and would simply have been destroyed, or maybe used for extra target practice or things like that. 

When freshly made new stuff is given, that is also quite not the same as just giving Ukraine money, because of course those things have been manufactured in USA, so it has had an effect in employment, stimulating local economy and so on. Of course, that money could have been used to pay for those employees to do something else, but still, investing in the military and its equipment as a jobs program isn't exactly a new thing in USA. 

Direct financial aid is probably the closest thing to literally just taking some money and giving it to Ukraine, but even there, the whole thing is part of a complicated system of international and domestic monetary policy and other such details. 

Finally, everything given to Ukraine goes into destroying Russia's military. The weaker Russia is, the less USA has a need to spend on its military to be sure to match Russia and potential coalitions that would include Russia. In theory, giving aid to Ukraine now should lead to less military spending in the future, although the MIC in USA has so strong lobbyists that spending probably isn't affected much in practice.",False,1662656368.0,t3_x8px77,t3_x8px77,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

1. Bad intel lead him to conclude that the population (at least in the east) was more pro-Russia than it really was.
2. Same bad intel lead him to conclude that most eastern cities were just going to do what Kherson ultimately did and hand over the keys to the city to Russia without a fight
3. Figured that Zelenskyy would flee (I dont know if this is bad intel or just a bad assumption) and Ukraine would collapse.
4. Russia easily won the war with Georgia
5. The war in Chechnya was harder but ultimately it was won through sheer force, which Russia thought it would bring
6. Russia sure didnt think the west would unite like it did in providing weapons, training, and sanctions.  


If all of that was true, then the country becomes a Russian puppet state and likely gives the eastern part (Donbas, Crimean officially, land bridge between the two) to Russia.   


Had Putin been right and Zelenskyy fled then I think western Ukraine becomes a manageable puppet, like Belarus. There would be partisan fighting in the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, but without NATO weapons and without the morale boost that came from the early victories (and the prez sticking around), I think Russia sees is as manageable - like Chechnya.

We plan again.  We set up the same conditions for success.  Our forces roll into country y, the world yells, cares, but doesn't do anything.  We win. 

We expect to win because the conditions are similar.  Our forces roll into country z, the world almost gets its act together, but it's over before it can care.  We win.

We look to our neighbour where it appears conditions are similar.  We shake our fist: ""you are next"".  Our forces roll again.  We are curb-stomped.

Militaries often become incompetent after victory because of the myth that they did things right, and they do not often look to see where, but for a minor accident, they were inches from disaster.

Conversely, potential adversaries, and particularly those on the receiving end, or soon to be on the receiving end - ask ""how the heck do we respond to *that*?  And look for the weaknesses.  And learn to exploit them.   

Ukraine has had almost a decade to figure things out.   NATO war-games and is ruthless in after-action analysis ... on both sides.  It's hard to become incompetent when the death of a single soldier is criticized as a ""loss"", but it is very easy if you view them as cannon fodder.

However, if Ukraine did push that deep that they're at Kupiansk and even manage to take it, that would be one massive blow to the Russians to put it extremely mildly. It would mean Izium and the region surrounding it is now completely cut off from the north. And almost entirely from the east as well.

My understanding might be limited of just how big a disaster this would be to the Russians, but it's probably safe to assume it would mean the loss of Izium and the surrounding regions. And with Izium being the important lynchpin that it is for the entire north eastern front, calling it a disaster is probably not enough to do it justice.

Yes.  Wartime munitions contain oxidizers.  So, unlike other fires, access to oxygen is not a limiting factor.

But activation energy is.  If a projectile needs to be at a certain temperature to detonate, it must heat up to that temperature.  Surrounding burning stuff shares its heat until reaching the next round.

Note that munitions are *designed to be stable* and *only to be initiated by fuses or other controlled mechanisms*.  They are designed to be, as much as possible, *insensitive to heat*.  Ideally they are stored tidily with separation, too. 

So they have to get *quite hot* to cook off.",False,1662617600.0,t3_x8px77,t1_injzeym,,1,29,0,29,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Firstly different types of targets blow up differently.  A missile has significant amounts of rocket fuel alongside its explosives.  Rocket fuel = big fiery instant explosion. 

Military explosives on the other hand are deliberately harder to blow up.  You don't want shells to blow up aside from exactly when you want to.  Think about an explosive artillery round, you're literally launching one package of explosive by setting off another explosion next to it inside of the artillery barrel and expecting it not to blow up until it hits the target.  They have to be extremely safe and stable right up until you want them to blow up.  

These types of explosives, called secondary high explosives, burn rather than blowing up if you set them on fire.  They need specific conditions to arm and detonate. Eventually an ammo depot fire will get hot enough that some of the ammo will explode but it's not an instantaneous process that will cause a single big explosion and mushroom cloud.    

The exception of course is if the initial impact is powerful enough and hits the ammo exactly right to set it off and trigger a chain reaction.  You see this often when Russian tanks get hit by a shell or missile because the tanks are designed in such a way that the ammo often does explode this way.",False,1662618218.0,t3_x8px77,t1_injzeym,,1,27,0,27,0,0,

If an ammo depo is tightly packed in it will burn off all the ammo from the outside in as oxygen can reach it to allow for combustion. It's not too dissimilar to creating a bon fire. Despite all the timber piled up being very flammable and even drenched in fuel it will burn for hours because only so much oxygen can get into the fuel.,False,1662616893.0,t3_x8px77,t1_injzeym,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

This is by design to prevent accidents while handling and storing the explosives. 

In earlier times things like nitroglycerin were used, but since it's highly unstable (i.e. the threshhold for detonation is low), a lot of unwanted explosions happened.

You can heavily mistreat modern ammunition without it blowing up and it normally is intended to slowly burn away when ignited.

Now, if you just lob a GMLRS into a russian ammo depot with a diverse set of explosives and ammunition, stored in different places/cavities/buildings in the area, you will probably see what we are seeing when a russian ammo depot gets hit. If the shockwave is big enough, it detonates a Portion of the explosives (with a suitably low threshhold for detonation), if it just ignites it you see the slow burn.

As much pro-Ukraine as I am that's blatantly false and only serves to indoctrinate us into the same blindness that plagues russia. 

There's even a Pravda article and other national ones where it's clear there are still strong elements of corruption within Ukraine's military and that all is not well on every front. Shit happens in war, sure, but that corrupt colonel who ordered foreign volunteers to loot and threatening them with a gun when they refused isn't just happenstance. The article even starts with how these volunteers had sent several letters from several nationals to every instance they could before they turned to the media because they didn't want to sabotage the morale but they were at their wits end, people had needlessly died, and many had left. 

You can only win if you accept the faults you have and try to improve upon them. If you just eat propaganda for every course then you'll end up as blind as putin and other idiots around him who thought they had 110% in everything. 

Also the offensive around Kharkiv (russias second big pull back) was met with heavy internal critique because it used mostly NDF which are in no way fully equipped for offensive manoeuvres and it cost way more Ukrainians than need be. There's a reason some generals and commanders were moved around after it, some relieved of duty.",False,1662629105.0,t3_x8px77,t1_inkalq0,,1,-7,0,-7,0,0,

Probably not. The Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives have one thing in common (aside from their timing and success so far); they are trying to trap Russian held positions on the wrong side of rivers that are too dangerous to cross. This is a cautious counteroffensive - which is what the US was counselling them to do. To take natural barriers that will be easier for Ukraine to defend once reached, rather than open broad fronts of trenches. 

But that cuts both ways. For the same reasons Russians fear trying to maintain supplies across bridge chokepoints in range of Ukrainian artillery, Ukraine needs to be cautious with the same. That means they won't (likely) be massing troops on the riverbank and storming across the Dnipro any time soon. Not until they can rebuild the crossings they destroyed, anyway.

Which means if they want to reach Crimea fast, they would have to do so from Zaporizhzia. But that means they would have to deal with Melitopol, which is one of Russia's earliest and largest captures, so it will be well supplied and defended. It's a city that is too large to encircle that far away from Ukrainian controlled territory. 

They could perhaps go around Melitopol to reach Crimea, but that doesn't really offer them much strategically. They could cut off supply routes from there, but Russia still controls everything east of Melitopol and could resupply it from that direction.

I suppose there's always the option of a surprise marine landing from the west staged out of Odessa or Mykolaiv to go around the Dnipro. But that's a lot of open water to cover while the Black Sea fleet still exists.",False,1662679541.0,t3_x8px77,t1_innfqf3,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

Izyum is not a city that Ukraine wants to take by force. It is a concentration of most of the actual trained/equipped (not conscript) Russian forces in the area and surrounding it basically takes them out of the fight. The goal in that region is Kupyansk which is a major tool for either side to control the area.

Don't think so. Most of the the artillery in Izium is being used to target Ukrainian positions in the Donbas. Kharkiv is being shelled by Artillery that is located close to the international border with Russia.

Russia loses the ability to send rail freight out of Belgorod or SW out of Valuyki down to the rest of the front via the line that goes to Severodonetsk.

Rail cargo will all have to loop around to basically Luhansk (city) before being sent West towards the front lines.

It's going to degrade Russian logistics/mobility fairly significantly.

In addition even if they have some during a large attack you might use up the small stock you have quickly and then be left with nothing to take on even lightly armored vehicles.

Ukriane has also moved up air defense so Russia can't support their troops from the air, not that there has been a lot of close air support in this war anyway, and have penetrated so deeply Russian artillery probably had to pick up and run so they can't provide fire support either.

The US combat philosophy rests on the idea of ""violence of action"" where if you're going to do something make sure you have overwhelming superiority and hit them with everything you've got so hard and so fast that the enemy simply can not withstand the pressure and they either retreat, surrender or die. That's the philosophy all those Ukranian troops have been learning from NATO for years now.

Russia runs on artillery.  One of the reasons the defences were penetrated was that artillery couldn't do its job which is to maul and fix assaulting armor before it can break through the first line.  But artillery in defense sucks ammo faster than artillery on attack.  And it's just impossible for Russia to put enough shells at enough points at a 1000 mile front to keep arty supplied for tens of minutes at most.   It does no good if your arty 10 miles away has thousands of shells, if you burn through the shells you have on hand, and the tanks are rolling in your direction.   

By hitting forward ammo dumps, Ukraine increased the time-to-resupply of Russia's front lines.  This obviously put a damper on offensive operations because they can't feed the beast as easily... but as a side effect, it also increases the necessary stockpile of ammunition for defensive lines - because your arty has to last as long on defense as it takes to call up reserve ammunition from the rear.  If the has to come from 200 km away... and you have been taunted into pecking away at your stockpile, and are down to 15 minutes of sustained fire... you're in deep kaka. 

The current thrust was made possible by exactly that... a series of depleting strikes on dumps; a continuous probing of the front; and a diversion of attention to Kherson set the conditions.  

And the current thrust itself is aimed at a jugular strike on supply routes not just to Izyum, but the main eastern corridor from Russia. 

The critical point is here:  49.709702, 37.626989

Within one km of that point is a river crossing, a junction of roadways direct to Russian territory, and rail-yards with a direct connection to Russia.  This not only supplies Izyum, but Severonetsk and the entire eastern front.  

If Russia loses control of this junction, which is now within artillery range of UKR, then combining that with the isolation of the right bank of Kherson, Russia will have lost efficient grounds routes of supply to almost half of its deployed forces directly from Russia...

So the F-16 may be a ""light fighter"" but it's weight over the landing gear is high. Taking off from roads and makeshift airbases is bad, as the high weight on the landing gear will wear down the runaway/road or whatever unless said runway is designed to take the load. If Ukraine only has runways capable of handling the load of multiple F-16 sorties a day at a few select airfields, those become instant targets of russian cruise missiles. A Gripen on the other hand is designed to launch from Asphalt roads like MIGS are, and allows Ukraine to hide the location of it's secret makeshift airfields much better. 

Think how roads in the Northern US are designed to deal with constant frost/rain/snow, and even then they take damage, whereas roads in Arizona are cheaper, because it simply isn't necessary to design them to be more robust.

Why? Because the F-16 may not actually work at Ukraine's Airfields. The F-16 has an extremely harsh footprint on runways, compared to the MIGS Ukraine uses. The US DOD hinted at this recently, saying F-16s logistics would require a lot of effort. 

The Gripen on the other hand, is designed to work even on asphalt roads, and better allows Ukraine flexibility to run their airfields from makeshift roads. It's likely Ukraine can maintain these easier than F-16s. 

I'm not a Gripen fanboy or anything, and find those people ridiculous, but the Gripen makes a lot of sense as a western fighter NOW. F-16s later.

As for the A-10, there is weird privately funded training program for them in Ukraine and US air force doesn't want them anymore.

Yes, one part of the army are conscripts. But conscripts are generally prohibited from being sent abroad e.g. Ukraine.

The above article I linked, shows that there indeed were conscripts in Ukraine, which caused an upset (even in the duma). There are also examples of ""kids"" signing contracts by force etc.

But I still don't think there is a large percentage of conscripts in Ukraine.

 >The 2022 Chornobaivka attacks consist of a series of Ukrainian attacks against the Russian-held Kherson International Airport at Chornobaivka, which began on 27 February 2022 during the southern Ukraine campaign of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Chornobaivka, located in Ukraine's Kherson Oblast, has seen a total of 39 attacks on Russian positions by the Ukrainian Armed Forces following a bombing and takeover by the Russian Armed Forces of the town's airport. According to Ukraine, these attacks resulted in the death of the Russian general Yakov Rezantsev of the 49th Combined Arms Army on 24 March.

&#x200B;

from what i know:  


First things first lets only focus on general Fe (steel) based vehicles. From what i know and found there actually are cases in wich you have more complicated and delicate materials such as Cu, Ti and even some fancy U integrated in certain cases, but this is most likely not the case for mass produced things like soviet era Tanks. However when it comes to aviation (incl UAVs) there is a whole new world to unpack including the degration of those nasty nasty carbon fiber.

&#x200B;

Most stuff to be found is most likely simple hardened steel. This is just elemental Iron with added carbon to it to make basic steel. The hardening part then comes by mechanical or thermal processing (most known the simple quenching). For the hardening Part that will go away once you heat the Metal up to a certain threshhold (known as recrystallization). Then you basically have to decide what you want/need out of your material. I would argue that the most logical (and weirdly poetic) endproduct will be steel for constructions. This stuff usually doesnt have to many requirements and most likely you can process it in any steelplant that is able to handle elemental Iron too.  


For composites things will get a little more tricky as you will want to seperate the layers. Here i dont know the exact processes but you should always be able to simply melt the Steel down, burning the plastic in the process and then fish out the ceramics wich will most likely have a way higher melting point.

The Last possibilty is if you have to deal with some alloys. Those can have stupid high melting points and behave differently depending on the elements and their concentration in the mixture.

A total collapse is unlikely just yet.

Even if Ukraine has momentum I think the smart play would be to bunker down and regroup, especially if they can secure a salient across the river.

As awesome as the recent updates are, I think it's more likely we'll see another frontline established with the rivers as a natural barrier and Ukraine trying to puncture the lines to establish a foothold.

Either way, it will reflect very badly on Putin once major cities are liberated, and reality starts to sink in domestically. With most of the competition already dealt with and the Nationalists being the only ones with a real anti-government voice in Russia, I'm personally predicting the Nationalists will win on the domestic politics front and Russia will likely mobilise to try and salvage the war effort, and Putin will lose a lot of public support.

They can establish positions, reinforce them with artillery and rockets from 60 miles back. They can see the battlefield and they are launching coordinated attacks. 

They can take back all the land south and south east of kherson, once they get over the dnipro. They can punch through and get that zaphorizia plant back (big eeeek.....) and melitopol and basically hold it. Any Russians trying to get close will meet Mr Himar. 

Ukrainians seem to have close to air superiority now too. At least parity. Their newly established advances will be covered by AA systems and they're launching plenty of air missions now. 

I'm actually quite optimistic they can really move on this. The Kharkiv assault shows a very well-coordinated force. 

I think in fact they could eventually take back the NE, and meet up with the southern force at Donbas. Russians get pinched from two sides. 

Crimea comes last. Cut off the ability of Russians to come onto the mainland and knock out that Kerch bridge (it's a nice bridge... Too bad because that'd be a nice one to keep. A nice border bridge). Knock that bridge out, leave a modest force there to keep Russia in Crimea for now.

Most LNG project quotes I can find suggested they needed global prices to be around $7/MMBtu or higher for breakeven after factoring in the liquefaction/shipping costs.

-------------

So yes, at the low natural gas rates of previous years, you're right that LNG processes could be significant chunk of the overall price - European prices were mostly in the $5-10/MMBtu range over the past decade.

However, given the extremes that European prices are *now* at, the cost of the LNG processes is basically nothing. LNG imports are trading at around $75/MMBtu in Europe recently, and have been above $20/MMBtu for the entire year.

----

In short - operating costs of LNG are a tiny fraction of what Europe is currently paying for gas. 

However, there's obviously a massive shortage of everything (export capacity, tanker capacity, import capacity) now relative to how much Europe would *like* to be buying (lots more), so prices have skyrocketed.

That said, calling a death before it happens is really more of an art and a competent, experienced hospice nurse can often predict it down to a few hours as far as 48 to 72 hours out - so this likely *was* expected, it's just (likely) about to happen, now.

The EU proposes a set of retaliatory tariffs and holds a vote - but several Eastern nations think that Britain is a better security partner than the EU, and are more concerned about Russia than about the threat of sausages entering Ulster without the right documentation, and they veto the proposal. That would be an ideal outcome for Britain, and fatally undermine the effectiveness of the EU as a collective bargaining union.

 >Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: Œ∫œÅœÖœÄœÑœåœÇ, romanized: krypt√≥s ""hidden, secret""; and Œ≥œÅŒ¨œÜŒµŒπŒΩ graphein, ""to write"", or -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± -logia, ""study"", respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others.
