Day 301 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a very quiet day with no missile or drone strikes, but as usual border towns and Kupiansk/Izyum districts continue to get shelled pretty much daily. Also, today we had some country-wide air raid alerts during the day because Russians were flying a bunch of their bombers along our borders to scare us as they always do, and there’s a good chance that a new big missile strike might happen soon.

It's great to hear that the news about Patriots being given to us were true all along, now with official confirmations. But I wonder when they will actually be operational, and if our forces were already being trained on them in secret, because waiting another 3-6 months would mean a lot more damage being done to our infrastructure that could have been prevented if the training had started sooner.

I also wonder how big of an impact JDAMs will make, being able to extend the range of dumb bombs is great, but it also means that our bombers will have to fly higher to get that extended range, which will make them easier to target for enemy air defenses. I guess if we are getting them, then we already know what they will be used for and they will make an impact, otherwise we wouldn’t be getting them.

>Staying Warm With No Central Heating or Electricity In Killing Cold  
Cold makes you stupid long before you realize that you are too cold. The stupidity helps to ‮llik‬‎ you. Don't get cold.  
If you know where the water shutoff is, shut off the water to prevent pipes bursting when they freeze. If you don't know how to find it, that will have to be a problem for Future You.  
Identify a room or rooms that you will live in. Move your family into it or them (including pets and plants). Close the other rooms and keep them closed. They are not your concern at this time. You are camping together in a designated survival space.  
In your designated survival space, cover all windows. You want as few gaps as possible. Pin curtains shut. Pin sheets/blankets to curtain rods. Pin sheets/towels to the walls over the curtain rods, if you can, and let them hang over the blankets. Put rolled-up towels/mats/blankets on windowsills. Windows ‮kcus‬‎ away heat. Keep the heat.  
If you don't have an interior door between your designated survival space and the rest of the house, also pin up at least two blankets in the doorless entrance(s) of that space. Again: Keep the heat.  
If your power is out so you can't use the stove, and it's in your designated survival space, cover the inner opening of the exhaust vent with something.  
Get up off the floor. If you have at least two pieces of upholstered furniture, shove them together to make a nest. Use whatever you've got--broomsticks, upturned kitchen chairs--as supports for a roof of sheets over the nest. As many people as possible spend as much time as possible inside that nest. Prioritize the most vulnerable. Also, leave a hole in the nest-cover someplace, for air exchange.  
If you are all camping in a bedroom, drag more mattresses, pillows, and cushions in there and cover the floor.  
If sitting in an office chair, put on a lap blanket and tuck it around yourself and put your feet on a cushion or a rolled-up towel.  
Everybody puts on layers. Layers trap heat. Put multiple layers on your trunk and on all limbs, including your legs. They don't have to be heavy layers but there should be lots. If all you have are T-shirts and jeans, wear a tight T-shirt under at least one baggy one, cut the feet off a pair of loose socks and pull them over your arms, and throw your bathrobe on over your shirts, jeans, and arm-warmers: it hangs down over your legs. And put on two pairs of socks.  
The head: Put something on your head that you can keep on your head. A soft hat, a scarf, a do-rag, a light towel, a hood. A surprising percentage of modern hattage is just meant to get you from car to building and is uncomfortable if you wear it for longer. But you lose a lot of heat out of your head and a cold head makes for headaches. Cover it.  
The breath: Put something over your nose and mouth. A flu mask is great! Or use a light scarf, a tied T-shirt, or whatever will keep your breathing holes warm.  
The hands: Cover as much as possible. If you don't have gloves or mittens, find something with long dangly sleeves and make like Obi-Wan. Or cut thumb holes in a pair of socks and slip them on--they're better than nothing.  
Sleeping: You are camping. Buddy up as much as possible. If sleeping alone, make your sleeping space smaller. Put a sleeping ‮gab‬‎ under the blankets or hold the blankets down with pillows on either side of your body. If you have two thin mattresses or foam pads, consider making a sandwich with a people filling. Smaller spaces trap more heat!  
Food: Snack and sip all day long. Food can be burned to make more heat, and cold dehydrates.  
DO NOT use ANY auxiliary source of heat and/or light that produces exhaust, unless you have a working exhaust system for it already. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide will ‮llik‬‎ you quietly. Don't use camp stoves or barbecues indoors. Don't try to heat your dedicated survival space with a gas oven if the power is out. Don't even use that fireplace unless you KNOW that the chimney is in working order. Don't hope. KNOW. ETA: Invisible exhaust is still exhaust. If a flame of any size is involved at any point, do not use it.  
The sole exceptions are old-school hurricane lamps--this kind of situation is what they're for--and candles. You cannot heat a space with candles. You can, IF you have a safe ceramic object such as a bare terra cotta ‮top‬‎, heat the ‮top‬‎, and then hold your hands near it to warm your fingers so that you can do things. You do this by putting two fireproof objects on either side of the lit candle and putting the upturned ‮top‬‎ on the objects. The candle will heat the ‮top‬‎ after a while, and the ‮top‬‎ will continue to dispense non-flamey heat after you move it away from the candle, which you can then reposition for lighting. Again, this is not a way to heat an interior space. Just your fingers. But that can be very good for morale and make it easier for you to do fiddly things that don't allow for gloves.  
If using hurricane lamps or candles, NEVER leave them unattended. It's wise to keep some water near each one, just in case.  
If you have a tankful of hot water and a bathtub, consider whether it makes sense for you to fill your tub with scalding hot water before the tank loses heat. Vulnerable people (who don't have to be watched around bathtubs) can sleep behind a closed door in the bathroom until the water cools.",False,1671652902.0,t3_zr9pp2,t3_zr9pp2,,0,64,0,64,1,0,

▪️ The West is trying not to notice the ""elements of nuclear blackmail"" on the part of Kyiv, including provocations against the ZNPP;

▪️ The revelations of Merkel and other politicians showed that it was not the Russian Federation that was the source of the conflict in Ukraine;

▪️ During [Roskomnadzor] Russia saves the population from genocide and terror;

▪️ Ukraine resorts to prohibited methods of struggle, including terrorist attacks and contract killings;

▪️ The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are taking comprehensive measures to prevent the death of the civilian population;

▪️ The West spends significant funds on the information war with Russia, thousands of fakes about events in Ukraine are published. At the same time, the Western media are silent about the numerous war crimes of the Ukrainian military;

▪️ The West seeks to prolong military operations in Ukraine as much as possible in order to weaken Russia;

▪️ The Armed Forces of Ukraine suffered huge losses, a significant part of the weapons and equipment of Ukraine was destroyed;

▪️ As a result of the assault on Azovstal, more than 4 thousand Ukrainian soldiers were destroyed, 2.5 thousand surrendered;

▪️ The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation plans to deploy support vessels, emergency services and ship repair units in Berdyansk and Mariupol;

▪️ During the war, more than 100 thousand people received awards, 120 of them received the title of Hero of the Russian Federation;

▪️ The RF Armed Forces occupied an area 5 times larger than that which the LPR and DPR occupied until February 24;

▪️ 300,000 people were drafted under “partial mobilization”, 830,000 people were released from conscription to support the economy. More than 20 thousand people volunteered for the troops;

▪️ The supply of weapons most in demand in the army has been expedited from 2024-2025 to 2023. The volume of financing this year allowed to increase the supply of weapons by 30%;

▪️ The modernity of strategic nuclear forces has been brought up to 91.3%. Serial deliveries of the Tsirkon sea-based hypersonic missile have begun;

▪️ Deliveries of the Kinzhal and Zirkon hypersonic missile systems to the Russian army in 2023 will be increased;

▪️ Taking into account the desire of NATO to build up military potential near the borders of Russia, it is necessary to take measures to create a group of troops in the north-west of the country;

▪️ It is also necessary to create two interspecific strategic territorial formations of the RF Armed Forces - the Moscow and Leningrad military districts;

▪️ It is necessary to bring the number of the RF Armed Forces to 1.5 million people, including contract soldiers - up to 670 thousand;

▪️ And you also need to gradually increase the age of conscription of citizens from 18 to 21 years, and raise the limit to 30 years.",1671638409.0,1671629890.0,t3_zr9pp2,t3_zr9pp2,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

>The most important step Ukraine and the West can take to contribute to diplomacy is to support Ukraine’s war effort militarily and economically. Moscow is only likely to negotiate in earnest if it faces defeat on the battlefield.   
>  
>Postwar diplomatic settlements often reflect the balance of power on the ground. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the West should reject Russian cease-fire proposals that would lock in Russian territorial gains. Under Putin’s leadership, Russia has never returned conquered territory to its original, legal jurisdictions. A “frozen” conflict will be used as a means of further destabilization of Ukraine and preparation for a new conflict when the time is right. When it is agreed, a cease-fire should be unconditional and not made contingent on sanctions relief. Once sanctions against Russia are removed, it is most unlikely that they will be restored. Sanctions should not be lifted until Russian forces withdraw from Ukraine’s territory and Russia pays compensation for the damage caused by its invasion. The United States and its allies and partners should maintain a strictly enforced export control regime on Russia to deny it the things it needs to maintain its military effort.

That said, we should keep mentioning this and be vigilant about Putin -- the man doesn't open his mouth without a well rehearsed line he needs to stick to and which he is helped with by a well oiled Kremlin propaganda machine and loaned actors etc -- the objective is multi-fold: shift and affect narrative to prepare for the next step. He's bending Russian people one try at a time, his wet dream is whole nation behind him so he can claim Russia has been wronged and retaliate with everything they have, knowing the people will get behind tank production lines and everything else needed to not only sustain his war but develop the means to take it to the next level from the current ineptitude.

NATO and U.S. have been functioning as a peace-time economy while slowly but surely developing sophisticated weaponry using available talent and effort.

Russia now depends on a miracle that is gotten through convincing its largely pliant population that has rightfully not been fostered with a true functioning resilient democracy, to get behind the narrative authorities desperately need to have pushed all the way to every man, woman and child, to switch gears so that they can at least produce or obtain weapons, in sufficient supply, so that they can truly and firmly put their boot on Ukraine like they managed with say  Chechenya. They still stick to the same rulebook, they just don't have the ingredients for the old recipe at the moment.

Everything Putin says is a step towards obtaining his ingredients to go by the otherwise the same tried and true recipe.

This is why I also tend to say there may not be an ""off-ramp"" for him -- it's in reality used as an _on_-ramp as Russia is desperate for any measure of a breather they can use to regroup, reassess and retry.

Consistency and capability with regular rapid response to developing situation, is collectively our best method to take Russia apart into constituent components, and let faith sort it out as they say -- hopefully Russia reassembles itself in a manner where it stops being a pain in the world's ass.",1671712236.0,1671646728.0,t3_zr9pp2,t1_j14e4mw,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

This is right but incomplete. After shutting the water off, open the faucets to release the pressure and if possible empty the pipes as much as possible. This will give some room for water to expand if it ever gets to the point they freeze.

One other thing is to keep the tap open allow for the water to flow which may prevent freezing. But if it gets cold enough, the pipes will eventually freeze anyway so if you can shut off the water the better. The downside of shutting the water is that it may not be possible to reopen it when needed...

On the bright side, snow/ice is easy to get by during winter and you can unfreeze it with a heat source as needed. So shutting the water and emptying the pipe seems smarter.

Also keep the faucets open when opening the main water. This will get the air out of the pipes first instead of getting compressed air in the pipes.",False,1671654156.0,t3_zr9pp2,t1_j15d6fy,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Just in fuel alone it's mind boggling: 

The M1 Abrams is ***famously*** gas hungry, their efficiency is measured in **gallons** *per mile*.

A US armored brigade (tank brigade) uses on average of 65,000 gallons.  Per **day** (up to around 100k gal/day max).  (For comparison, a US infantry brigade is 21k gallons/day).  

The above fuel consumption amount takes into account all of the vehicles required to support the tanks as well (fuel tankers, etc...)

Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgeVuwxOkAo

Then you have to take into account the massive logistics chain: how to repair the tanks, the hundreds of people that need to be trained to maintain the tanks, the thousands of spare parts you need to import, etc... 

Then complicate the matter of the M1 Abrams' engine is a turbine, vs the T-72 & T-80 using a diesel engine, (some variants of the T-80 are also turbines, but obviously they don't use the same engine as the M1)

It's not as simple as switching labels, and going ""here ya go!"".  Hell 1 patriot battery takes almost 100 people to operate it, and those ~100 people need about 6 months to train. 

MRAPs and APCs are fairly simple, big diesel engine, beefy transmission, frame, big tires (or tracks), and a .50 cal, or some sort of autocannon, but overall nothing *that* unknown to their maintainers.  Modern MBT's and aircraft are a whole different ball game.

Let's see the nasam for example. It fires the AMRAAM missiles. So it's 18km in maximum altitude and 30km of maximum range of the missile itself travelling at mach 3. 18km is the ceiling altitude of a SU-35 that has a top speed of mach 2.5. So, theoretically, a nasam can shoot down an SU-35, but it's nowhere near appropiated for that task. And are useless for bombers that fly higher and from the distance (30 to 50km is the typical).

The patriot system has massive missiles with ranges up to 150km at 25km of altitude flying at slightly more than mach 4. Basically can shot down any russian aircraft and probably some ballistic missiles as well.

There's also the radar resolution stuff. Basically it's the radar quality and it's ability to proper detect and determine what's that thing flying (cruise missile, friendly aircraft, etc). This is another huge advantage of the Patriot systems. They have really, really good radars that probably would detect even the SU57's.

The downside is that the patriots are VERY expensive, costly to operate (has many parts that needs power to operate and many vehicles) and not that abundant. To put numbers each missile is average of 1 million dolars, and those are not the expensive ones. An AMRAMM that the NASAMs shots it's 300k to 700k.

The *significance* of the matter is twofold:

First, it's a major US weapon system, so it signifies a serious commitment to Ukraine's defense. This is on the significance scale of providing tanks or airplanes to Ukraine.

Second, it's significant in that Ukraine's air defenses are going to be maintained by Western systems. Ukraine has been fighting a war with their existing S-300 stocks for over 300 days. They have a limited number of missiles and replacements are few and far between. Every now and then Russia catches a S-300 TEL or radar and destroys it.

This means that Ukraine's ability to defend it's airspace has been slowly eroded over the past 10 months. There was going to be a point to where Ukraine could no longer prevent Russian aircraft from ranging all over Ukrainian territory at will hitting everything that looks like a military target, elementary school, or hospital. Obviously, this is bad. Ukraine needs to keep Russia from using their aircraft to hit targets deep inside of Ukraine.

By giving Patriot to Ukraine, the US has taken the first step at replenishing Ukraine's depleted stocks of long-ranged SAMs. It means that Russia will continue to keep their aircraft safely outside of Ukrainian-controlled territory. When Russia does venture close to Ukrainian territory, they will continue to have to fly low to the ground and thus remain vulnerable to MANPADS and shorter-ranged SAMs.

There may be other SAMs that make their way into Ukraine- I'm looking at *you*, SAMP/T.",False,1671643629.0,t3_zr9pp2,t1_j146rfj,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

The rockets that hit ZPP came from the east. Should've explained they flip 180 degrees on impact there, Sergei.

It was Russia who meddled in the internal politics of another state. It was Russia who took Crimea. It was Russia who gave a bunch of rebels anti-air systems. It was Russia.

No.

Whose definition of terrorist attack are we using Sergei? Yours differ from mine.

Are taking or planning to take? Because it's not really working right now. But that is a familiar feeling to anyone who knows anything about the russian army.

Yes, they do. No, they don't.

Sergei mate, you know how this ends quickly without depleting more russian combat capabilities.

133.7% of their helicopters, as I heard! But in all seriousness, *if* this statement were true, then why are you struggling?

If the Russian people are direct descendants of the Kievan Rus, the ideal Russian superman is descended, at the moment, from a city in Ukraine. This cannot be, because Russians are the greatest people ever, and always have been. This is how you get to Ukraine being a ""mistake"", because obviously the land inside Ukraine is and always has been Russia. Kiev under this thinking is *already* Russian, along with the rest of Ukraine. It is the Ukrainians who are the traitors denying and defying their birthright, and if Russia defines the superior man, the Übermensch, then Ukrainians must be sub-human. QED.

Yes this ret-conned backstory has a lot of holes in it — enough to drive a Soviet-era tank through, in fact — but the truth has never stopped the Kremlin before. The way I understand it, I believe they subscribe to the same factual relativism we've seen a lot of recently: the winners write the history, so if enough people believe it the history presented will become what actually happened. Kim really did shoot 18 holes-in-one, and Russia did save the world single-handedly in WWII, and it's us who are the ungrateful assholes.

The fertile cropland, the natural resources to exploit are great stuff, but they're already Russian anyway. The population to exploit to be the farmer-serfs likewise. Someone needs to produce the value for the ruling classes to steal. The power flex over the populations of both Russia and Ukraine is obviously important to Putin, but the power of revanchism, to reintegrate the true shape of Russia, is the real goal. 

Putin has already stolen all the money, and seized all the power. He has anything and can have anyone killed or imprisoned at will. So what's left? To control reality itself.

From a purely battlefield perspective, I think this is right. Ukraine clearly has the edge and Russia has shown no ability to retake land that they have lost - so Ukraine's edge should lead to them advancing.  


But politically its different. Russia is much bigger. They can bring more troops to the field. They can sell oil to buy arms. And most importantly Ukraine is entirely dependent on US largesse.

I'm not so sure. 

In the book Dead Souls, Chichikov goes around ""buying"" serfs that had died since the last census. This benefitted the seller since they wouldn't have to keep paying taxes on the dead serfs. As for Chichikov, he suddenly seemed to be the owner of hundreds of serfs and intended to use them to get a loan and pocket the money. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Wagner gets paid per conscript per year. They sign the conscript, get a handful of rubles from the Russian government, then send the conscript to a certain death--thus freeing them from having to pay wages to the conscript. They are soldiers that exist only on paper because they're prematurely sent to a Ukrainian grave. Thus Wagner is only ""paying"" conscripts that exist on paper and actually pocketing the money they get from Russia. 

Is that Wagner's real motivation? I doubt it, but it wouldn't be surprising.",False,1671652056.0,t3_zr9pp2,t1_j154k2b,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

There is no point firing a missile if the other side sees it coming and has whole seconds to respond. BVR combat typically(and this is making a complex topic extremely simple for the purposes of brevity) is an aircraft with a powerful radar lighting up an area that happens to have an enemy in it. The aircraft launches a weapon that doesn't actively hunt but uses the reflected radar to ""see"" the target and guide itself towards it. Then that missile fully acquires and kills the target when it reaches a fractional second detection radius to prevent any action by the target. In other words the systems we used to use to detect a threat are now always triggered effectively because there is ALWAYS radar lighting you up in the air.

So they'll lose this colonial war as those other Empires lost theirs - but it will fight pretty hard for it - as those Empires did as well.

And its obvious that this Empire does not want to die.

You pour water on yourself when you enter then you throw water on the stones to increase the steam and heat which helps open the pores which makes it easier to clear your skin. You can then lather up in soap and pour water on yourself again which then would wash away the dirt and whatever was coming out of your pores. 

If you have a sauna tent next to a river or lake you can cut a opening in the ice and jump in to wash yourself or if there is snow outside the sauna you can use freshly fallen snow to wash yourself by scrubbing yourself with snow. 

All of these things would be difficult to do with a regular temperature tent but with a sauna you can build up enough heat in the body and quickly heat the extremities back up so you wont do damage to yourself from freezing.

Believing that the sociopaths in congress would consider jeopardizing their own power to assassinate a foreign head of state at the capitol is... slightly crazy.

Furthermore: the western allies can't continue to prop-up Ukraine's economy for another 5 years or longer.

What if a launcher shoots down 4 drones but they’re followed by a bomber or 3 iskanders? There is definitely a limited amount of ammo, and spending it on non-priority targets also incurs an opportunity cost.

With a bit of luck, a lone machine gunner can take out one of those drones. How close would it need to get to a transformer to justify a Patriot launch? 

We also don’t know where it’ll be deployed. If there are high-priority military targets in the area, spending rockets on drones aimed at infrastructure can cost lives, battles, cities.",False,1671658136.0,t3_zr9pp2,t1_j15oo28,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

It only specifies that when the US is providing that much military aid, it should also look into seeing what diplomatic solutions are possible, looking for ways out that *has the support of Ukrainians*.

Also note that the letter was written at a time in the conflict when this still looked like an option, and when leaked immediately retracted, so they never actually decided to go through with this call.

It was *not* in any way saying to stop supporting ukraine, but rather trying to support Ukraine in all possible ways, which should include finding out if negotiations could work. (And since the letter never got published , it is safe to assume they realized that negotiations wouldn't work).",False,1671611011.0,t3_zr9pp2,t1_j12za48,,8,4,0,4,0,0,
