* Russia has failed to encircle and isolate Kyiv with the combination of mechanized and airborne attacks as it had clearly planned to do. Russian forces are now engaging in more straightforward mechanized drives into the capital along a narrow front along the west bank of the Dnipro River and toward Kyiv from a broad front to the northeast.
* Russian forces have temporarily abandoned failed efforts to seize Chernihiv and Kharkiv to the northeast and east of Kyiv and are bypassing those cities to continue their drive on Kyiv.  Russian attacks against both cities appear to have been poorly designed and executed and to have encountered more determined and effective Ukrainian resistance than they expected.
* Russian movements in eastern Ukraine remain primarily focused on pinning the large concentration of Ukrainian conventional forces arrayed along the former line of contact in the east, likely to prevent them from interfering with Russian drives on Kyiv and to facilitate their encirclement and destruction.
* Russian forces coming north from Crimea halted their drive westward toward Odesa, and Ukrainian forces have retaken the critical city of Kherson. Some Russian troops remain west of the Dnipro River and are advancing on Mikolayiv, but the main axes of advance have shifted to the north and east toward Zaporizhie and Mariupol respectively.
* Russian forces have taken the critical city of Berdyansk from the west, threatening to encircle Mariupol even as Russian forces based in occupied Donbas attack Mariupol from the east, likely to pin defenders in the city as they are encircled.
* Russian successes in southern Ukraine are the most dangerous and threaten to unhinge Ukraine’s successful defenses and rearguard actions to the north and northeast.
* Russian troops are facing growing morale and logistics issues, predictable consequences of the poor planning, coordination, and execution of attacks along Ukraine’s northern border.

I’m sure almost no one will see this, but if you do I think it’s actually important.  

If you know of anyone who lives in Russia (and isn’t completely brainwashed by Putin) let them know what’s *actually* going on.  

I have a few exes in Russia and old friends and they can’t see much of what we are seeing in the US or around the world.  Their media is extremely censored right now, probably much more than normal.  

Luckily almost everyone I know understands this, but I don’t think they understand the true magnitude of the situation and we’re pretty shocked when I told them what I was seeing here.  Most also don’t understand why the US is only sending guns and not actually fighting for Ukraine/NATO/etc.  I have a feeling that Putin is really doing a really good job at blocking all talk of outside politics and painting the US and European countries in an even worse light than he usually does.  

So, if you know anyone, reach out to them and let them know what is happening on the ground.

The vote by the 15-member council is procedural so none of the five permanent council members - Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States - can wield their vetoes. The move needs nine votes in favor and is likely to pass, diplomats said. The special session would be held on Monday, diplomats said.

Only 10 such emergency special sessions of the 193-member General Assembly have been convened since 1950.

The request for a session on Ukraine comes after Russia vetoed on Friday a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow’s invasion. China, India and UAE abstained, while the remaining 11 members voted in favor.

The General Assembly is expected to vote on a similar resolution following several days of statements by countries in the emergency special session, diplomats said. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but carry political weight.",False,1645909248.0,t3_t25q00,t3_t25q00,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

U.S. Weighing New Sanctions on Russia’s Central Bank

>Among its options to expand sanctions on the Russian central bank, the administration could ban any dollar transactions—and allies might complement with similar action against euro, pound and yen trading. Such a step could hobble the central bank’s ability to sell its foreign currency reserves. Another option could be a full blacklisting that freezes any assets held in U.S. jurisdictions—and other countries’ jurisdictions where allies join Washington in the move—and prohibit any transactions. That could not only hit the bank’s currency-stabilization operations, but also the transactions critical for the country’s international trade.",False,1645908168.0,t3_t25q00,t3_t25q00,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

In contrast, I'm deeply invested and moved by the people fighting for their home against a massive aggressor. They are outnumbered and outmatched, yet they have surpassed everyone's expectations and pushed back one of the leading world armies. To top this, their leader - in the span of a week - has gone from being ""in over his head"", to a goddamn living legend. 

I have nothing but massive pride and respect for the people of Ukraine and wish them godspeed. We need to support them to the bitter end.

Thermobaric weapons (broad category) are different from conventional bombs in oxidizer to fuel ratio. It helps to think of oxidizers as just air here. Normally, explosions are ""adiabatic"" (fancy term for fast) so you need to bring the oxygen with you because air can't act as an oxidizer. So the limit here is that you need about 60% (mass) as oxidizer not fuel as well as needing the oxidizer mixed (so small(relative) boom).    


Thermobarics don't use oxidizer (or they do but it's environmental oxygen) and they do this by avoiding adiabatic detonation. Detonation is sorta a 3 part process, so the fuel (100% of the weapon) spreads out over the area (typically areosolized metal or PETn not sure what the Russians use), then is ignited. After the ignition the cloud has been dispersed (so when combustion occurs) it now needs oxygen, and it gets it by pulling the air around the cloud into the explosion itself. This is why they're so effective against hard targets ie bunkers ect cause they go from vacuum (negative pressure) to blast (positive pressure) very very rapidly

Here’s what it might feel like to be hit by one:

“Imagine taking a deep breath then submerging yourself in water. Then imagine having all of the oxygen forced instantaneously from your body. Try to inhale again. But instead of cold water filling your lungs, toxic, flammable particles start killing you from the inside out.”

Like, young/inexperienced/untrained conscripts are sent into Ukraine. They are easily stopped. Cannon fodder (or *Javelin* fodder). Some captured troops claim they have no idea what is going on. The captured Russians say they were told they were being sent to training exercises. Not to combat. 

Where are their supplies and medic teams? Did Russia send any? It's like they sent expendables. Some vehicles are running out of gas on the roads before they even make it to a city. They drive single-file out in the open, making them easy targets. 

It's either the most inept invasion ever, or Putin has some REAL sinister shit planned.

Russia does have medical teams on the other side of the border. Apparently Russia also told hospitals there and in Belarus to prepare for mass casualties. Whose? Certainly not the soldiers sent into Ukraine to die. 

Now there are reports that say Putin may use a dirty bomb or otherwise attack *his own people* (good thing he got the hospitals ready). He will then blame this on Ukraine or NATO, and use it as justification for REAL war. 

I'm sure the US/UK/EU has way more intelligence on the situation, and hopefully they also have some line of communication to the oligarchs/elites in Russia, with the hope that they can *Julius Caesar* Putin before the madman does start WWIII.",1645906977.0,1645906938.0,t3_t25q00,t3_t25q00,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

I know no western nation wants to give open military support to Ukraine, for fear of escalating this conflict into a world war. I understand that. So they ship in arms, and they provide intelligence, but they aren't actually sending any troops.

At least not openly. But what stops the US, or European nations, from covertly sending troops. A few elite units disguised as Ukrainian soldiers. How would Russia know?

In particular, Russia has a fleet in the black sea that's supporting the invasion, against which Ukraine can do little. But a few modern  submarines would make short work of those ships. And Russia would never see them, and even if they somehow saw them, wouldn't know what country they are from. Seems like an extremely low-risk strategy to covertly help Ukraine.

Given this conflict, it cannot be emphasized enough how important it is that Republicans are not handed the keys to the White House, or Congress. I will explain why this is relevant on the world stage:

- Giuliani revently gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius.""

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack domestic opposition's data.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands) 

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO...

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

Modern conflict isn't like an action movie. Things generally speaking happen at much, much, longer ranges. If you're close enough that you can actually *see* what you're shooting at then your life expectancy just dropped to the center of the earth. 

I remember watching a video of a firefight between US special forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan. They pointed the camera towards where the shooting was coming from and all you could see was a hill. The Americans, who remember are the most elite troops of the most elite fighting force on earth, were just spraying the entire ridgeline down with machine gun fire. They weren't shooting at anything in particular because how the fuck are you going to have time when you're getting shot at to patiently pick out a small dot in the distance, line up a shot, and wait to see if the dot hits the ground? 

Doesn't happen. You find out where you *think* it's coming from then you fire and forget. 

Go listen to some of the audio coming out of Kiev right now. People who are ""aiming"" don't just pull the trigger on an AK and empty the entire clip in one go. I mean they *are* but it's less dramatic then you'd think.

But that's defining ""winning"" merely as eventually controlling Kyiv-- 

In practice--

1. Dropping elite VDV paratroopers with no support led to some success in securing key strategic locations but many mass deaths/routing/capture of Russian troops
2. Northern and Eastern resistance faring significantly better than expected by everyone-- sets Putin's plans back at least a day or two-- which is significant in what should've been a swift <5 day operation 
3. Russia loses information war
4. Big international condemnations and sanctions to Russia, supplies to Ukraine. Russia lashing out bolstering support for NATO and intervention
5. Russian threat of retaliation economically and militarily against Sweden/Norway if they attempt to join NATO pushing them further towards NATO
6. Incoordination, logistical/supply issues further humiliating Russia despite still ""winning""
7. Extremely unexpected level of resistance from Ukrainian army and civilians. Zelensky's unexpected brave actions and effective communication likely add to this-- Ukrainian troops also have great morale, a stark difference to Russian troops

Finally, even if they formally control Kyiv, what? Whatever is left of military will counterattack-- likely fail, but still. Armed civilians will resist. Any puppet government would require continued Russian forces to secure occupation, ensure they aren't overthrown.

Russia will most likely ""win"" and take Kyiv in under a week (I hope I'm wrong here) but they're still fucked.

Literally no geopolitical (long term) nor military expert I know has any idea what the hell his plan is or how this advances Russian interests.

Everyone else sends in their gung-ho hard motherfuckers for the invasion, crushes the opposition with shock and awe, and lets the conscripts hang out in the rear with the gear.

The fact that isn't happening points to a few possibilities, absolutely none of them good:

* This *is* Russia's expeditionary force - their elite units are too small in number to make a meaningful difference, and they're filling in numerous gaps with their Bronze Elo folks. All of the touted high-tech warfighting platforms aren't actually viable in the field due to lack of parts, maintenance, trained technicians and operators, etc.
* Russia's generals were dubious to begin with about the invasion, and are holding back their elite units and good gear to avoid putting those units in harm's way for what they see as a doomed mission.
* This is totally according to Russian doctrine, which is FUBAR - absolutely nobody should be okay with losing thousands of soldiers' lives and materiel, even obsolete materiel, in futile assaults.

The last one is particularly ludicrous. Consider that prior to the invasion, everyone thought that Ukraine was going to get rolled and that sanctions would basically be us wagging our fingers at Russia as they gloried in the spoils of war. Since Ukraine has withstood multiple assaults, that calculus has changed - sanctions are now seen as a way to put pressure on Russia to give up a very loseable war.

I am betting almost none of those forces are in the 200k pack. Russia would want to keep them in case someone decides to step in while Russia is busy in Ukraine. But now they are finding that sending in the amateurs wasn’t the ideal move.

Again, all just suspicion. I don’t believe Russia is entirely this… useless… in war. This feels more like they thought they were sending their army for a very formal training exercise that wouldn’t stress them much.

The standard nuclear policy of all countries with nukes is something called Mutually Assured Destruction or MAD.

If russia nukes, every other country with nukes might fire back on them, and in return russia will fire on them.  Billions could die and russia would absolutely be wiped out.

There's  small chance russia might risk one nuke, but it's SO scorched earth for them.  You're going to irradiate the area, instantly have every single nation on the planet ready to nuke you, and in this sort of scenario there's nothing he probably can't do with more conventional weaponry.  It'll take a LOT more of it, but if putin wants to turn kiev into a crater there are non nuclear ways.  A nuke would be a really extreme response and a gigantic gamble from putin.

There is a whole process that has to be gone through, multiple layers of validation and authorisation to do it. You don't want to accidentally launch nukes because someone misheard a command.

There would be ample opportunity for senior Russian commanders to decide that Putin has gone off the deep end, and no they aren't going to be the ones that decided to destroy their own nation.

Not saying it's impossible, but its incredibly unlikely in a scenario where Russia is the aggressor and not under invasion itself. There is actually a precedent for this, you can look up [Vasily Arkhipov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Arkhipov), he was ordered to launch a nuclear strike against a US fleet because the captain thought they were being attacked by US ships and refused to do it because he didn't think it likely the US had attacked (they hadn't as it turned out).",False,1645908882.0,t3_t25q00,t1_hyk1u3m,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I think the reality is simply that Russian spending has not been sufficient to maintain a military that is simultaneously large, modern, well-trained, and well-maintained. It is a few of those things, perhaps even different ones depending on which units you are discussing. But they are not a massive modernized elite force.

This will be yet another lesson in the changing face of modern war. Tanks are less important (which the US Defense Department keeps telling Congress) when you have man-portable weapons like Javelins.

And more, Ukraine's allies have had time to establish and regularize whatever lines they are using to supply aid. 

This is to say nothing of whatever mounting political disunity, wavering morale, and so on.

I am always clear to say that no, I do not think that Ukraine can necessarily prevail indefinitely against Russia if Russia is willing to fight to the most brutal, bitter end.

An ICBM launch would trigger MAD because the whole system is set up to start responding when one is launched as you don't know from the launch itself what the target is, and don't have time to wait to find out. An ICBM can hit a target at its maximum range in about 30 minutes, and closer targets in 15 or so.

But a local event probably wouldn't trigger MAD - a short range cruise missile or bomb dropped from high altitude, or a theoretical man-portable 'micro-nuke' in the low kt range. In those cases we'd detect the detonation by satellite, but for a counter-strike to start someone would have to give an order. Don't get me wrong, there would absolutely be a reaction of some kind - but a country's military leadership won't feel the same urgency about a blast on the other side of the world the same way they would by ICBMs being tracked in air.
