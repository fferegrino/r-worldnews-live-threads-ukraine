Russian forces occupying the ruined Ukrainian city of Mariupol have demolished 1,300 high-rise apartment buildings without carefully removing hundreds of dead bodies buried under the rubble, Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol Vadym Boychenko said on Friday.

Speaking on the city council's Telegram, Boychenko — who has fled Mariupol for Ukrainian controlled territory — said people remaining inside the city have told him, ""Initially, the occupiers involved Mariupol residents in dismantling the rubble carefully.""

But Boychenko said when the Russians saw the actual number of bodies found under the rubble, they immediately moved the local residents away from the area.

""The real number of bodies under the rubble of destroyed houses is frightening. Almost 50 to 100 people were killed under almost every destroyed house, and 1,300 high-rise buildings were destroyed in Mariupol,"" Boychenko said
Boychenko said that because demolition of buildings has been carried out indiscriminately, the bodies of Mariupol residents killed in the fighting have been removed to landfill together with the concrete rubble.

On May 25, an adviser to the mayor, Petro Andriushchenko — who has also moved to Ukrainian-held territory — told CNN that Mariupol town hall officials believe at least 22,000 residents of the city were killed during three months of war. 

Mayor Boychenko on Friday said ""Unfortunately, the real numbers of those killed in the city may be much higher than we reported.

CNN is unable to independently verify the number of people killed in Mariupol, with the free press now unable to access the city and those still inside too scared to speak openly.

Day 108 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling was pretty bad, and somewhat close to us. They shelled us at around 5:30pm, some residential districts were shelled and also Mala Danilyvka, fires started immediately after, we even saw the big pillar of smoke from our window, it’s only about 2,5km away from us, so at first we thought that it was actually even closer, because the smoke pillar looked very big.

In Mala Danilyivka they shelled a couple cottages; they were burning from the MLRS rockets that hit them, don’t think anyone died or was injured. They didn’t completely burn down, but were badly damaged. Many photos and videos were posted almost immediately, and as usual there wasn’t a single military target in sight, but Russians will probably say that those were obviously Nazi cottages.

There’s barely any information about the progress of our forces in Kharkiv oblast, but today Arestovych said that they are already fighting for Kozacha Lopan. That would mean that at least 5 more settlements were liberated recently, but nothing was said about it yet, there’s now much more secrecy compared to before. 

This is amazing news if it turns out to be true, the progress in Kherson oblast is also pretty great, it’s being more openly talked about too, and our forces in Zaporizhia oblast have also apparently started moving recently, but not much is being said about it, other than that Russians have been pushed back by 5-7km.",False,1654999251.0,t3_v9papv,t3_v9papv,,0,75,0,75,2,1,{'gid_2': 1}

""Well, it looked like not a queue to get a passport, but an attempt to get a ticket to flee. Very demonstrative.""

He said: ""The Ukrainian troops are gradually liberating the territory of the Kherson region.

""Today the village of Tavriis'ke has been added to the list of returned settlements of our state. There is certain success in the Zaporizhzhia region as well.""

""Do you remember how Russia hoped to capture the entire Donbas in early May? It is already the 108th day of the war, it is already June. Donbas is holding on.

""The losses suffered by the occupiers, including in this area, are extremely significant. In total, the Russian army today has about 32,000 dead souls. For what? What did it give you, Russia?""

bb06ebfc61fd9a758d98fb0a362bd66e,v9papv,ibxv1s7,"I was curious about Russian artillery numbers so I did some research. I was actually surprised that they had less than I anticipated. Most of their artillery actually seems to be in the form of self propelled guns.

If we just look at 152mm pieces, Russia has two towed variants: the Giatsint-B and the Msta-B. Combined they have 390 of these pieces in active service, with another 1700 in reserve. They have around 600 pieces of 122mm active with another 4400 in reserve, but these are much older (from the 1960s) and have a more limited range than the 152 pieces.

However, they have around 1800 self propelled guns of 152mm active, with about an equal amount in reserve. There's also around 200 pieces of 122mm self propelled artillery and another 2000 of those in reserve. Likewise there are some lower amounts of larger artillery like the Pion, but there are only a few hundred of those total, active and reserve.

So mostly Russia's artillery strength seems to lie in this self propelled fleet. That's around 2200 artillery pieces of 152mm, self propelled and towed. The Russians are said to be expending 50,000 rounds of ammunition of all artillery types daily. I'm not sure of their stockpiles, however, the USA recently purchased 148000 rounds of artillery of all sizes in 2018. That was seen as a major increase from the previous years allocation of 16,000 new rounds. The USA obviously had not been using much artillery in COIN operations at that point. The US military rotates out shells on a 15 year timetable. So assuming at the low end of 16k shells produced per year, you'd get a theoretical stockpile of 240,000 rounds. Obviously thats way too low, and only taking a low year of production. It also doesn't take into account that Russia is probably using older ammunition. So on the high end of 150k shells produced per year, say stockpiled for 30 years you get a store of 4.5 million rounds. If you fired 50k shells per day, you'd run through your entire stockpile in 90 days.

But, the US only has about 1500 pieces of 155mm artillery of all types, and 800 pieces of 105mm. Say that ammo the US produced was strictly proportioned related to the relative numbers of 105 and 155mm pieces. Just for the sake of discussion. So around 2/3rds of that 150k rounds, so 100k rounds of 155mm per year produced. Russia has around 8600 pieces of 152 and 122mm. So we could say around 4x US artillery systems, but only about 1/4 of that is 152mm. If Russia had an ammo stockpile strictly proportional to each system then it'd give you 18 million rounds total, and about 4.5 of that in 152mm. So, at 50k shells a day then you'd be out of ammo in one year.

If you kept up 50k shots a day fired, and you produced no new ammunition.

edit: For the sake of comparison, Ukraine has (had, at the start of hostilities) around 450 pieces of 122mm artillery and 700 pieces of 152mm towed artillery. Plus the 100ish pieces of 155mm western systems. They also have 600 units of self propelled 122mm and 300 of 152mm. Then there's the other 100 odd 155mm western self propelled systems on top of that. Total of just north of 2000 pieces of all types. So 1/4 Russia's. Which is a disadvantage but doesn't seem the \*worst\* disadvantage. Obviously Russia is seriously concentrating systems around Donbass to achieve the 10:1 advantage the Ukrainians are reporting. But also shows the big problem if the Ukrainians run out of 122 and 152mm ammo, since they only have a couple hundred 155mm pieces.   


Since there are not enough 155mm tubes in existence to send to Ukraine, a better solution may actually be to set up 122mm and 152mm production somewhere.",1654922133.0,1654921415.0,t3_v9papv,t3_v9papv,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

France is unwilling to make concessions to Russia and wants Ukraine to win the war against Moscow’s invading forces with its territorial integrity restored, a French presidential official has said, as Paris seeks to assuage concerns over its stance in the conflict.

President Emmanuel Macron has been criticised by Ukraine and eastern European allies after an interview quoted him as saying it was vital not to “humiliate” Russia so that when the fighting ends there could be a diplomatic solution.

“As the president has said, we want a Ukrainian victory. We want Ukraine’s territorial integrity to be restored,” the official told reporters when asked about Macron’s comments.

“There is no spirit of concession towards Putin or Russia in what the president says. When he speaks to him directly, it is not compromise, but to say how we see things.”

Joe Inwood

Reporting from Kyiv

As we've been reporting, Russia is running short of modern weapons and is having to resort to using heavy anti-ship missiles in ground attacks against Ukraine - which are highly inaccurate and can cause significant casualties and collateral damage, the UK's defence ministry says.

We saw a few weeks ago during Russia's strikes on the southern city of Odesa they were using old soviet stock.

The analysis we're getting is that it's symptomatic of the Russians running out of weapons.

They've used up their more modern cruise missiles, they've used their more high-tech precision weaponry, so they're having to dig deep into the arsenals to find out what they have lying around.

I'm sure some Russians would dispute that - they'd say there are some tactical reasons for doing this, but it's quite likely, especially given the sanctions Russia is under, that a lot of its weaponry requires modern western technology imports to make new stocks.

So once they've used them all, given the sanctions they're under, maybe they have to resort to use old equipment.

It all started with a commotion in the train that was taking conscripts from the assembly point in Moscow to the military unit. When the train stopped at the Aprelevka station, one of the conscripts, 21-year-old Maxim, asked to go to the bathroom and suddenly disappeared.

It turned out that somehow the boy jumped out of the train and ran away in an unknown direction to the deep forest - right in his military uniform. They started looking for Maxim in the end, and found him late the next evening.

After that, the fugitive was taken to the unit for an explanation. There, the young man said that he did not want to serve in the army because of his homosexual orientation. According to the conscript, he had been living with a guy for two years and told the enlistment office honestly about everything.

However, the commission was not particularly impressed by these facts. To Maksim's surprise, it turned out that the law does not prohibit drafting homosexuals, since such orientation is now not considered a disease (in USSR it was). As a result, they listened attentively, found the guy good enough for the army, and put him on the train again.

If my reading is correct, ukraine is trading with russia. Trading space for time so supply come in and casualty+sanction weaken russia, and trading the eastern front (donbas) for southern front (kherson). 

Lets say russia take donbas. What's next? russia cant say it win, annex the land, and end the war. Russia only win when a peace treaty is signed, or when russia control most of ukraine and install a puppet government.

Russia cant control ukraine by inching forward as they are doing in donbas right now, because ukraine can simply counter attack elsewhere,and the land gain will be more then the land lost, because arty warfare is very slow - you shell some static defense to dust, move forwarda bit, and repeat. Also the longer you go in enemy territory the further away you are from rail road (so logistic become harder).

If Russia withdraw troop to defend the ukraine counter attack, rinse and repeat, and russia now have to spread the troops on all front.

Zelensky responds: says he asked for preventive sanctions and the Western partners didn't want to hear him. Says that he had many long phonecalls with Biden prior to the invasion, so the words about ""not wanting to hear"" require clarification.",1654931989.0,1654926068.0,t3_v9papv,t3_v9papv,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

We know this didn't happen. The US offered Zelensky to set up a govt. in exile in Poland. He said UKR would fight. *However, this private chat between Biden and his donors is troubling.*

And now this info from unnamed US officials (on deep background)

Of course, NOT an official communiqué, which in my opinion is even more trouble.

**In the UK, another official military source in the Daily Telegraph, echoes the Post's pessimism.**

>Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: “There is, at best, what might be termed incremental strategy with again no early and decisive synchronisation of ends, ways and means. It is a ‘let’s see how it goes strategy’, in other words not really strategy at all.

Ukrainian forces are experiencing a shortage in long-range artillery systems, while Russian artillery continues to overpower Ukrainian infantry
Russian forces adopted a new unspecified strategy that allows them to make more careful maneuvers
Ukrainian defenders need long-range artillery and air defense systems/need consistent Western support

This seems like a really good take. I've noticed recently that Russian artillery destroyed is exceptionally low (a lot of days at 0, attributed to low ammo for counter-battery), and I heard recent reports that Russian soldiers were being more careful (recently attributed to a change in commander).

It seems Russia still has an artillery range advantage, and now they're not as eager to throw themselves into the meatgrinder. In saying that, Ukraine has largely protected their territory (MANPADs, clearer skies), so both sides are stalling.

Switching down to the Kherson front, however, Ukraine is making clear gains, but still not taking out many artillery systems. It seems to me like the redeployment from Russian forces in the south has been artillery, not troops, which is allowing Ukraine to push forward.

What I'm taking from all this is that Ukraine needs an advantage over Russian artillery, and only then will they be able to push Russia back. Until then, Russia is likely to make further gains. It actually makes sense that Russia's advance stalls in city settings, because artillery reduces its effectiveness in such a setting.

Tl; dr - artillery is key, and Russia still holds a complete advantage in that arena.",1654994449.0,1654994226.0,t3_v9papv,t1_ic16eu7,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

World leaders have a really “interesting”(for lack of a better word) role in PR.  When Biden makes a statement like the US is sending HIMARS, Russia loses its shit then threatens nuclear war because of X red line.  US then backs off until Ukraine promises not to use the HIMARS to attack Russia.  Biden then decides sending HIMARS won’t cross the red line.  

Russia then has to decide if it’s going to stfu or do something.  Additionally, Zelensky stated Great Britain was meeting its “obligation”, others weren’t, and he was sort of disappointed that the US isn’t stepping up further, and that the reality isn’t matching the myth.  So please consider that this reporting might not be for the audience you think it is.  It could be performative and for domestic consumption in the US, I.e trying to rally support for Ukraine from the right by knocking Biden, domestic consumption in the EU, France has no choice but to send more weapons because the US is abandoning Ukraine, or just about anything. 

And that not to say that any of it is wrong.  The US could be delaying transferring weapons due to logistical constraints, there could be training that needs to be completed and there’s no reason to transfer yet, or even Russia knowing where the shipment is and being able to strike it when it’s transferred or anything really.  

We have to keep in Mind we know nothing in all actuality about what’s really going on.  Macron playing “peacemaker” could be a role, and he just looks serious while he whispers threats and insults like “The CIA is coming for you, you cancer riddled fuck” or “I keep sending my Rafales to blow up your factories and all you can do is take me mocking you for hours everyday.”

We’ll get the whole story someday.  For now, just calm down and wait for the clarity of retrospect, because there isn’t really that much we can do other than continue to support and send nasty emails to our elected representatives whenever Zelensky gives us our cue.

May 23 (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Monday he was concerned about what he called moves by the West to ""dismember"" Ukraine, and accused Poland of seeking to seize the Western part of the country.

He offered no evidence for his assertions.

""What worries us is that they are ready, the Poles and NATO, to come out, to help take western Ukraine like it was before 1939,"" Lukashenko said during a televised meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, said Kyiv would eventually have to ask for help in preventing the seizure of western Ukraine.

Moscow has in the past suggested that Poland seeks to establish control over historical Polish lands in Ukraine, a claim that Warsaw denies as disinformation. read more

Poland is one of Ukraine's strongest supporters, sending weapons across the border and taking in more than 3 million Ukrainian refugees.

Belarus said in March its armed forces were not taking part in what Moscow calls its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, but it did serve as a launchpad for Russia to send thousands of troops across the border on Feb. 24.

Under a non-aggression pact signed in 1939 just before the outbreak of World War Two, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carved Poland up between them.

only that's part of the story, they have family members mailing care packages, they have friends making soup and dropping it off, they have tutors helping them study, heck they have paid for a few people to do their homework for them, they had grandma and grandpa sending them gift cards, and recently the administration approved them to have the super deluxe meal plan as well.

This is very much not the case here, with Russia keenly aware of its ineptitude. They don't view themselves as remotely capable of war with the US.

Else they'd be (1) massing some kind of troops by Finland, (2) not admitting that their forces were no match for the US sans nuke capabilities, which they recognize as a suicide vest, and (3) would actually be mobilizing, because what they've got ain't even close to enough and mobilization of a non-standing force takes time.

Ok, but what if they do blow themselves up? Well, if we stop with the kneejerk thing...

The US ran an effort in the late 1980's to escort US-flagged oil-tankers through the Persian Gulf past an Iranian blockade.  It wasn't completely peaceful, but in the end Iran backed down.

I am certain that this would end the same way (for Russia).

Unfortunately - breaking Turkey's control of the Bosporus would be a massive change, and could bring some pretty unpredictable results, not the least of which would probably be Russia trying to bring in some more naval support.  Not sure how hard Russia would try to fight back when we'd only be escorting grain shipments out of Odesa. That's a wild-card, but I don't think it's a risk of failure of an escort operation. It would only be a risk of escalation, and more humiliating defeat for Russia. And it might lead to western warships supporting the liberation of the rest of the coast.

From a health and safety perspective, some of the bodies might be better left where they are. For example, any ones near any of that dug up chernobyl soil. Any body not near any water drainage or whatever can also rot, it won't take that long especially in the summer. In the back woods you find dead things all the time, like moose and cows, and it doesn't really impact local health. I think it's the *volume* of rot that is the problem. That's where you either mass cremate or get the bulldozer and backhoes warmed up soviet style. Set a deadline for body reclamation while it's refrigerated. If the deadline is not met, into the pit it goes and in goes the next body in the queue (assuming a queue can be managed that way). This is a huge war, not a few accidents being mismanaged, and (especially for invaders) a consequence of this is bodies might not ever return home. It is possible to take personal effects (whatever those might be) and put them in a shoebox in a warehouse with a name on it. Storing and sending those back to the widows etc is a pretty damn nice thing to do all things considered.

Ukraine will not settle for peace. They will keep fighting, with or without military aid, until either Russia or Ukraine is defeated. If it's the latter, France, Italy, and Germany better be prepared for being called up to fulfil their NATO obligation over Poland and the Baltics.

It's in everyone's interest, including France, Italy, and Germany, for Russia to fail, and supporting Ukraine is the best option other than actually doing what needs to be done and getting involved yourselves.

I know that these 3 nations are not delivering much (they are sending something, whether it is enough is another matter) and the phone calls with Putin  with Macron and Scholz can also be criticized and Italy's peace proposal too.  However, everyone  is saying more or less the same thing as Biden: Only Ukraine will decide if, when and how to end the war.  

Sure they can hit Ukraine on the head in the backroom, but I doubt that they want to and can do it at all.  They don't have enough power for that (in a military sense). 

I would doubt that the deliveries from Germany, Italy and France make that much of a difference.  Sure, they sending or planning to send some good stuff.  However, in terms of numbers, it makes only a small difference.

At the moment, only the USA could pull something like that off (which they won't do either). Without the USA, Ukraine would have been defeated long ago, the whole of Europe simply sends far too little and possible doesn’t even has the capacities. 

The US is the most important nation in NATO. They decides more or less alone how this war will go and end.  Like in Afghanistan.  If the US pulls out, everyone else pulls out as well, simply because they don't have the capacity to replace them.  

Even the 2 strongest nations in Europe (Great Britain and France) look weak in comparison and in the past it has often been shown that without the USA they have massive problems when it comes to military matters. See Libya, where the British and French ran out of precision bombs for their jets after only 3 weeks and that was a relatively small conflict.

In short, I doubt they'll do anything like that, and even if they do, how are they supposed to do it?  

Put more money down Putin's throat?  All the money in the world doesn't help you if you can't buy any of it (I doubt that the Russians put computer chips of refrigerators into their tanks due to lack of money.) Pressure?  With what?  We won't send you weapons?  As I said, only the USA could do something like that and then Ukraine would have to bow down.  

But if countries like Germany, France, Italy or even others like Poland, Great Britain were to drop out, it would hardly make a difference.  Only the USA and Turkey (because of the drones) are important.",1654988032.0,1654985616.0,t3_v9papv,t1_ic0nwnd,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

>The FH-70 is technically not a vehicle, but it does have a limited ability to move like one, as the APU doubles as an engine. The APU is located inside an overhanging cab in the front of the carriage, with two seats on top on the left and right for a driver and another crew member. The APU is a Volkswagen Model 127 1.8-liter diesel motor, with 4 cylinders in a ""boxer"" configuration. It is air-cooled, spark-ignited, and produces up to 71 hp at 80 rpm. The fuel tank has a capacity of 55 liters.

>When using the APU, the FH-70 may be unhitched, positioned, and ready to fight in less than 2 minutes. If a target is to be engaged outside the weapon's traversal range once in its firing position, the trailing wheels may be lowered to the ground and the spades and trails raised, allowing the entire weapon to be quickly swiveled in the required direction. Once the target is within the traversal range, the wheels are raised (dropping the trails back onto the ground) and the spades are lowered; when the weapon is fired, the recoil from the first shot will embed the spades into the ground.

> When propelled by the APU, the FH-70 is capable of achieving 16 km/h on a road or other hard surface, and climbing a 34% gradient, and fording a depth of 0.75 m. While being towed, the FH-70 can ford a depth of 1.5 m.

* Russia is making incremental gains still, by leveling defensive positions with overwhelming artillery(of which they have a lot, and they have enough shells stockpiled to last them a long time). 
* Ukraine's counterattacks have been halted in both Kherson and Kharkiv, due to Russia's overwhelming artillery advantage 
* (not in the thread, but important info). The West's support of Ukraine is still not enough. Most heavy equipment sent can be measured in single digits, and they need triple digits to be able to effectively push Russia back. 

These are just minor bullet points, but these all point towards the fact that this war will drag on for a long time still. Russia may stop being able to push in the short term, but saying they will collapse is very far off the mark. They can keep up positional battles for a long time on all fronts, unless Ukraine gets a much more serious commitment from the West.

We all have to be honest with ourselves. Sending in heavy weapons was only going to happen after Russia pulled back from Kyiv. Straight fact is that we were not going to give Ukraine heavy weapons while Ukraine was under threat of having its government decapitated. Just how it is.

In financial straits, the company folded voluntarily and a new Rolls-Royce company was formed which was government owned, and which divested the car division to a holding company controlled by Vickers, who passed on manufacturing to to the Volkswagen group. Vickers however, later sold the branding to BMW, with VW's products being branded by a former Rolls-Royce subsidiary marque, Bentley, as VW no longer had the Rolls Royce branding rights. BMW started a new manufacturer with no direct material connection to the original company or its tooling, but simply applied the branding to it.

Short summary: the United States kind of sided with Russia and denied Japan lots of territory, which led to a societal and political meltdown in Japan.

Taken from the wiki:

*Although the war had ended in a victory for Japan, Japanese public opinion was shocked by the very restrained peace terms which were negotiated at the war's end. Widespread discontent spread through the populace upon the announcement of the treaty terms, causing the* ***Hibiya incendiary incident***. *Riots erupted in major cities in Japan following the incident, including demonstrations in front of the US Legation in Tokyo. Two specific requirements, expected after such a costly victory, were especially lacking: territorial gains and monetary reparations to Japan.* ***The peace accord led to feelings of distrust, as the Japanese had intended to retain all of Sakhalin Island, but were forced to settle for half of it after being pressured by the United States, with President Roosevelt opting to support Nicholas II's stance on not ceding territory or paying reparations***. *The Japanese had wanted reparations to help families recover from lost fathers and sons as well as heavy taxation by the government to finance the war. Without them, they were at a loss.* ***The outcome of the Portsmouth peace negotiations, mediated by the U.S., was received by the general Japanese population with disbelief on September 5th and 6th when all the major newspapers reported the content of the signed treaty in lengthy editorials.***

***As a result, the wartime government, the First Katsura Cabinet, which remained in power for the longest period (1,681 days) in the history of Japanese democracy to date, declared Martial Law to suppress the riots on September 6th*** *(one day after the official signing in Portsmouth, NH).

Russia's strategy is fundamentally different from Ukraine's and doesn't need precision-guided missiles.  They just need a line of batteries that lob a lot of dumb munition at once with low accuracy until targets are destroyed or UA has to re-position.  They're never going to run out of these munitions, nor the guns to fire them.  They have, right now, more artillery units capable of this than the United States has.  They're old and inaccurate, but that's all they need to be.  

But yes, the goal is running down Russian soldiers and eventually taking out enough high-profile targets to prevent the small offensives that move the line westward.  But this has to happen without losing just as many people as they are.  I don't know how to fix that, but it needs to get fixed, and securing the munitions to allow UA's current strategy to continue isn't a way to improve upon that situation.

USA is getting the best deal of the century by a mile. Weaken your second main geopolitical opponent, diminish his ability to attack your NATO allies, and his influence, and all of that without spilling your own blood.

Even your own sources has proved that your statement that U.S. did not provide aid before the war was wrong than you tired to say it wasn't lethal aid which was also proven wrong by your own sources. Now your trying to say that since the U.S. didn't provide tens to hundreds of billions of dollars of heavy complex for a war that they didn't know would actually start that they abandoned Ukraine which is ridiculous considering that A) Ukraine isn't a part of NATO or any defensive alliance with the U.S..  The U.S. isn't obligated to send any aid or personal the support could have simply been denouncing Russia for day at the U.N. than business as usual. B) the U.K. who you said ""was the only one how belived in us"" also didn't send heavy equipment but light equipment along with the U.S.. So which is it? You can't have a double standard for U.S. and U.K. either they both provided crucial support to Ukraine pre-war or they both ""abandoned"" Ukraine in your opinion. 

Also Isreal has been a U.S. ally for decades so of course the aid would be bigger. They also make thier own heavy weapons. With Afghanistan the U.S. invaded and had a obligation to support the government or use its own troops and that aid was over 20 years. 

Just accept the fact that you don't like the U.S. and your so blinded by that hate your looking for anything to say that's negative about a situation were overall they have supplied the most. I'm not going waste anymore of my time on someone who can't form basic arguments and support them with basic evidence. But if you're not a troll you should know that you have a strong bias that prevents you from looking at the situation clearly.",1654971944.0,1654969591.0,t3_v9papv,t1_ibyieeu,,8,1,0,1,0,0,
