Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 17 August 2022
 
- On 16 August 2022, both Russian and Ukrainian officials acknowledged that an ammunition dump had exploded near Dzhankoi in northern Crimea, where a nearby railway and electricity sub-station were also likely damaged. Russian media also reported that smoke was rising from near Gvardeyskoye Airbase in the centre of the Crimea.

- Dzhankoi and Gvardeyskoye are home to two of the most important Russian military airfields in Crimea. Dzhankoi is also a key road and rail junction that plays an important role in supplying Russia's operations in southern Ukraine.

- The cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear but Russian commanders will highly likely be increasingly concerned with the apparent deterioration in security across Crimea, which functions as rear base area for the occupation.

Day 175 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling directed directly at the city, but there was some aimed at Derhachi and other towns close to Kharklv. Even though there was no shelling, something much worse happened. At around 9:25pm there was a warning about jets taking off from Belarus, not even a minute later a fucking cruise missile hits Kharkiv, which means the jets took off earlier but they were reported too late.

They fired a cruise missile at a dormitory that had absolutely nothing to do with military. They killed 7 people and injured 17 more, none of which were soldiers. The fucking Russians in their telegram channels were celebrating it, saying a AFU base was hit, but the videos from the place that was hit tell a different story. 

Civilians were filming from within couple of meters of the destroyed dormitory, something that wouldn’t happen at a military base. There were no soldiers or military equipment anywhere in sight. On videos from inside of the building filmed by rescue services you can hear people saying “my grandma is trapped inside”.  Is that their definition of soldiers? There were deaf people and kids inside, most likely the people whose homes were destroyed by Russians prior to this strike.

Reading the happy comments from Russians just makes my blood boil. And then there’s the stupidest take I’ve ever heard in my life that is “Zelenskyy has to stop this, he’s fighting to the last Ukrainian”. I don’t know what these people are thinking when typing this, but Zelenskyy has no say in how this war will end. 

Unlike some people might think he doesn’t have the hero status here, if not for this war, there would be no Zelenskyy by this point, he was **massively** unpopular before the war, and a new Maidan would have already happened if not for Russia. If he decides to stop the war on the terms that Ukrainians disagree on, he will be hanged on the next day and the war will continue like nothing happened. This war is not against the government of Ukraine, but against its people, and everyone needs to understand this. 

In this entire war **not a single missile hit a government building in Kyiv** but there is an insane number of destroyed apartment buildings. Russians have to understand that they are not fighting against Zelenskyy, they are fighting against the regular Ukrainian people that are protecting their homes.|

In its relations with the Taliban, the Putin regime traditionally plays a double game –  formally, it is recognized as a terrorist movement, but in fact, Moscow has close relations with the Taliban.

The Talibs are ready to supply the Russian Federation with captured American weapons and send its fighters to the war against Ukraine.

The layers are repeated across depth, which makes it a challenge to evade, and extended the danger area well into Ukrainian territory. It was difficult to get aircraft to penetrate deep against that layered setup early on, though the Ukrainians managed it with some hairy nap-of-earth flying.

The deployment of longer-ranged artillery has begun to reverse that trend. By being able to drop rockets and shells against that first layer of air defenses, the area of Russian coverage was forced to drop back, which is giving the Ukrainians a bit more freedom to operate across the front lines. The HIMARS threat also has a significant amount of radar attention as well, which puts aircraft on a lower targeting priority with their fire control commanders. The possible HARM threat also has made the Russians skittish about leaving their search and guidance radar systems on, which makes the coverage even more spotty deeper in.

> People are asking if more preparation would have saved lives

So if I remember that interview correctly - this statement is wrong. Ukraines army (and government) did everything they could to prepare to the best of their ability for the siege that followed (remember that ruzzians had couple of plans to take Kyiv : in multiple hours, days and at most weeks). Zelensky deliberately publicly spoke about that there won't be any war, contradicting NATO's publicity policy and contradicting public statements from Biden and other important people. 

Intent was to not spread the wide public panic that will cause harm for Ukraine's to prepare and/or act when things have started, i.e. wide public panic would have caused collapse of public services, traffic jams, etc. before the war even started, setting Ukrainian army at a bigger disadvantage. With huge traffic jams Ukrainian army could not move as efficiently, with emptied cities - ruzzian army could waltz in much easier, etc.

Zelensky's example of staying in Kyiv - helped with recruitement and resistance efforts. Imagine that happening when cities would have been left empty? This just falls into ruzzian narrative - Ukrainians must leave their land and give everything away to ruzzians. Something like amnesty international said - Ukrainians are at fault for protecting themselves against murderous genocidal maniacal bastard ruzzians.

Only thing that can save lives - is that putin with it's sympathising ruzzians are dead or be too poor and weak to act against their neighbors. Hell - even now in occupied regions civilian population is sent to filtration camps, children are sent deep into ruzzia and who knows what kind of other genocidal efforts are going on.

Aircrafts are like faster and more dynamic artillery pieces so air supremacy has always been there goal while the other side of the coin knows they are fucked in the air and instead compensates with ground based arty.

As an example Ukraine at the start of the war had a rough 1000 artillery pieces. USA in total has 1000 split between the navy and the army while Russia had 2300 ish. 

Also don't forget a big part of that 10-1 is localized imbalances. Russia pooled all of their resources into Donbas because they could spread it out around the eastern pocket. Ukraine couldn't just ship everything in there so it's not even a question of equipment shortages. Their biggest problems were that they couldn't effectively strike at the arty with range advantage or take out the ammo dumps feeding the arty.

HIMARS is the most bang for the buck but I do think Ukraine desperately needs more arty and hopefully we can provide it. But also know that these guns are firing a ton which requires heavy maintenance so there's a shadow number of guns going out of commission and being fixed and sent back which also requires parts that you don't see. If anything I think the reports of the HARMS missile which is specifically made to take out anti-air emplacements might be one of those small things that could have a big impacts going forth as it might open up to more air strikes or drones and isn't a massive maintenance problem to just send.

Bonus point is that Ukraine just doesn't have the same access to fix up and get ammo for their large amount of old Soviet arty which is increasingly making things difficult. Sorry for the long rant but I think it's an interesting problem and yes, I do hope the west is more aggressive with sending and I have no idea how deep they can go in depleting their military of arty to send but I don't think it's a simple issue and the maintenance and ammo factor for effective usage is also worth considering as it might be a long war with gear taking tons of time to build so not sure sending it all at once is the best way.

And when the war was starting his approval ratings were around 25% or even less, he was just unpopular with everyone. Also the new controversy is that even though he knew about the incoming invasion, he didn't increase the defense budget, but instead spent the money on rebuilding the roads, which consecutively were used by Russian tanks to attack Ukraine.

In that case there would be no reason to join EU at all, as there would be no country that could join it. Well good thing is that Zelenskyy actually understands that his life is over if he surrenders our country to Russia, so he never will.

And there was no good choice in our previous election, there was Poroshenko who everyone got sick of, then there was a ton of Russia-bought politicians who would *immediately* bend over our entire country to Russia. Then there was Zelenskyy, who was a wildcard, we didn't know what to expect from him, but he made big promises that he never delivered on in the end. 

So really there were just 2 choices at the time. Poroshenko, who we knew what to expect from and Zelenskyy, which was something unknown, so most people chose the latter. Though in hindsight we don't know if that was the right choice, but it probably was, given that Zelenskyy managed to be a good wartime leader.

Like, how many units of system x are required in this areas to turn the tide when it has inadequate artillery support, how many with artillery support, how many combined with another system. They want data.

Fast victory isn't data, but they also want the data about how to achieve victory with the systems, so Russia just inadvertently walked into a DARPA live fire weapons testing environment, where the Military Industrial Complex wasn't to test out all the scenarios, which involves bleeding Russia dry, before providing means to really defeat them. 

We have see it politically in hand wringing about oh but should we send these systems? And they we send it along with a few experimental things. Wait, see what it does, repeat.

The war in Ukraine is an INVALUABLE measuring stick for how weapons systems can be employed in different configurations against opposition with differing levels of capability, that is real world boots on the ground data. Not drills, or simulations, or projections. 

Also, all the SIGINT aircraft we have flying around, that can actually network with the equipment we are sending, are getting lots of experience using new techniques to asses outcomes and locate and coordinate against an enemy. 

There is nothing that will turn off the flow of US weapons system, or prevent increasingly advanced system being sent to Ukraine to asses their field effectiveness. against a ""near peer"" adversary.

The reason Russia isn't going to start selling nukes is because there is no way to know how they might be used and what trouble that could get them involved in. Imagine if a Russian bomb was detonated on NATO or EU soil, that would guarantee they would directly attack Russia no matter who detonated it, they wouldn't care. They would hold Russia responsible for the actions of whoever they sold it to and that probably means world war 3 and no more Russia. Putin doesn't want that.

Scenarios like that are why only a handful of countries have acquired nuclear weapons, the countries that already have them generally do not want others to have them and at most supply some knowhow to others on how to make them and then leave the hard part of refining the nuclear material and constructing a bomb up to them. That way if they use it won't be ""their bomb"" it will be the countries that made it bomb and they have plausible deniability if something goes wrong.
