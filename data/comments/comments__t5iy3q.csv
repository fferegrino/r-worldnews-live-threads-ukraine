A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected.

More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said.

The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city.

The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence.

The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator.

Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city.

The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs.

Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes.

Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children.

 In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war.

 More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said.

Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties.

More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said.

Russian troops moved in to the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late Wednesday.

Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Two blasts reportedly went off in the city centre, followed by two more near a metro station, as Russia steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it.

The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The ICC process was sped up after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities to it, the largest referral the court has ever received.

The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said.

Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children.
 In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war.

Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control.

More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said.

Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties.

The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. On Wednesday, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against.

A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected.

Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border.

The U-turn comes less than 24 hours after the IPC said it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete when the Games open on Friday, but only as neutral athletes with colours, flags and other national symbols removed.

The IPC received immediate criticism for its initial decision, the Associated Press reported. It soon became evident that many athletes would refuse to compete against Russians or Belarusians.

IPC President Andrew Parsons, in announcing the initial measures Wednesday in a Beijing news conference, sympathised openly with the Ukrainian people but said his actions were constrained by his organisation’s rules and the fear of legal action.

Parsons said almost the opposite in announcing his reversal, noting his constituents had pushed back.

“In the last 12 hours, an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us,” Parsons said in a statement. “They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences.”

Parsons added:

What is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games.

When all is said and done, Russia's reintegration into the world needs to be contingent on a cooperative reduction in nuclear arms. 

This standoff between the United States and Russia maintaining 4,000 nukes has set the bar so high that even modestly sized nuclear countries feel the need to have hundreds. 

If this is settled diplomatically, or by Russia with force, it burns me that they will walk away with some ill-gotten token of victory to revel in as their nation collapses. In either scenario, this shit has to end. 

44 million Ukrainians are enduring death and destruction, heartbroken but understanding that an intervention may cost the lives of billions. If they can do that, 144 million Russians can endure the cost and pain it takes to continue endangering billions. 

When the basis of a nation's diplomatic policy has been reduced to yelling at the world 'u do that, u nuked,' they aren't responsible or deserving to share in the benefits, however fleeting, achieved through real diplomacy.

The rouble has plunged in value, forcing the central bank to double its key interest rate to 20% in order to protect the currency from speculation.

The levy on forex also appears to be a move to prevent trade in the rouble and ringfence the Russian financial system.

As far as sanctions are concerned, we will not veto, we will not prevent the EU from imposing sanctions on Russia. EU unity is now paramount.”

Orban added that Hungary’s ties with Russia had been “balanced and fair” until the very recent past, but the war has created a new situation.

He added, however, that there was no reason to cut energy ties with Moscow.

If we abolished energy cooperation with the Russians, the overhead costs of all Hungarian families would triple in a single month. I therefore do not support this move, let Hungarian families not pay the price of the war.”

The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days.

Despite heavy Russian shelling, the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian hands. Some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson but the military situation remains unclear.

The report added that the Russian defence ministry “has been forced to admit” that 498 Russian soldiers have already been killed and 1,597 wounded in Putin’s war, adding that the actual number of those killed and wounded “will almost certainly be considerably higher” and will continue to rise.

Hitler didn’t JUST invade Poland in 1939 and that wasn’t the only thing he did to start the World War. Hitler had a agreement with Czechoslovakia to only have a part of it, but then he took the entire thing regardless of the agreement he made. Ukraine and Russia had a agreement to respect each other’s territories and not to use their territory to hurt each other.  Russia broke that agreement a few years ago and they treated was basically null and void. Russia had Russian supporters in the Donbas region, similar to Hitler with Sudetenland, which was a part of Czech taken with the same situation. Right now, Putin is in the middle of taking the rest of Ukraine after taking over a small region of it previously.

The World War II didn’t start until Hitler invaded Poland 8 months later, because Britain and France threatened to declare war if he continued showing aggression and went for another country anyway. This is very like the United States and NATO threatening Russia not to go past Ukraine or else we will declare war on them as well. That’s definitely showcasing Putin being power hungry and wanting to go past Ukraine as well into other countries, which has been forewarned by other world leaders. There was no more room for appeasement when Hitler entered Poland anyway. Not only that but it’s been proven that China actually made a agreement with Russia about the invasion of Ukraine before it happened, agreeing that Russia would wait until after the Olympics. Hitler made a non-aggression agreement with Stalin on dividing East Europe amongst themselves to benefit each other, which Hitler also didn’t honor either. I don’t know if Putin will ever not honor his agreement with China but it really does make your head spin.

i think this is gonna be a brutal war with heavy casualties on both sides but eventually, Russia will have firm control of Ukraine more or less (maybe at least 70% of Ukraine or more) with great great cost on their part, starting from East Ukraine and areas bordering sea of Azov. Putin will most likely install a puppet government by then. A small paRT of western Ukraine that borders Poland, Slovkia, Hungary and Romania etc will hold out with a stalemate and Ukraine will eventually be divided between east and west Ukraine.

Guerilla warfare and skirmishes will commence throughout all of this with disputed borders here and there.

Having said that, Russia's economy will be super fucked at this point due to sanctions and everyone pulling out of Russia.

1- Putin declares war on Finland or Sweden.  Not to take territory.  To make it politically impossible for them to join NATO.

2- Putin tries to attack western supply trains before they reach ukraine.

3- Putin bombs Ukrainian guerrillas based in one of the NATO countries bordering Ukraine.

4- one of the former Soviet republics that has a beef with Russia tries to take territory or break away.

> **MUTUAL DEFENCE CLAUSE**
> 
> The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the solidarity between EU countries in dealing with external threats by introducing a mutual defence clause (Article  42(7) of the Treaty on European Union). This clause provides that if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article  51 of the United Nations Charter.

> This obligation of mutual defence is binding on all EU countries. However, it does not affect the neutrality of certain EU countries and is consistent with the commitments of EU countries which are NATO members.

> This provision is supplemented by the solidarity clause (Article  222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) which provides that EU countries are obliged to act jointly where an EU country is the victim of a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster.


And we have defensive pacts with each other:

Longterm is the key.  Short-term Ukraine is fucked.

Biden gets continually underestimated since he is old and your old grandpa, but he stuck several shivs in Putin and is coming back for another round. Putin underestimated both Biden, the EU, and particularly Ukraine. 

And, yes, sanctions aren't military.  But the ability of Russia to resupply its force in Ukraine for more than 6 months or a year is highly questionable.  If Ukraine can keep the western slice, the flow of arms to resistance will continue to drain blood directly from the occupiers. How badly do you want Kyev and the rest of Ukraine?  For how long?  At what cost?  What if your whole occupying force collapses?  If you install a puppet, how long will he/she last once you withdraw troops?  And what happens in Chechnya and other peripheries while your forces are in Ukraine getting bled dry? What is the ""exit plan""?

I have relatives who were sent to gulags or executed by the USSR (kulaks) and my grandfather fought the Soviets in the Second World War under the Latvians.  His blood before him fought the Russians in the Latvian War Of Independence. 

My grandmother and her sisters spent the war retreating across Europe avoiding Soviet retribution and Nazi terror.  One of them contracted polio and was in a wheelchair her entire life. 

For all their lives they spoke of the evils the Russian state commits and they had to deal with harsh bullying and scrutiny from their new American neighbors during the period of red paranoia when they migrated to the US in the early 50s. 

From the comfort of their new American homes they got to watch the Cold War, Soviet Afghan War, Chechen War & Georgian Invasion and had a slew of commentary to hit me with 

This is a long winded way of saying that from the cradle until manhood, I’ve had their stories and observations pounded into me and now they’re dead and here I am seeing it for myself in a newly packaged form.  

I’m finally seeing the big bad Russian bear come out with all of the world to see.

83b2f82ce63989be9ab641b7ae89d841,t5iy3q,hz5u1zf,"I'm not an economist, but my understanding is that Russia relies mainly on foreign imported goods for everything besides energy and food. Whoever sells them those goods will demand payment in Euro, GBP, Yen or USD. If Russia wants to pay in rubles, fine, but those sellers need to be able to convert the rubles to meaningful currencies. Russia's central bank just *raised* their interest rate from 9.5% to 20% in a desperate bid to get foreign currency into the country, because at this point no one will buy rubles. Lowering the interest rate would further discourage foreign money from coming in, further cutting off their ability to buy imported goods.

[edit] One other thing. You're thinking of lowering interest rates as a way to stimulate the economy, the way a country with a strong and internationally traded currency would do. But to tamp down inflation, interest rates need to go up; higher price of borrowing leads to less spending. And second-world countries with weak currencies don't have the luxury of using the interest rate lever to manage the domestic economy as easily; they basically need to use their interest rates as a lure to compete for foreign investment.

FWIW, at least one western country has decided to continue doing business with Russia, that being Mexico. This is likely because so much Russian mob money flows through Mexican cartels that any sanctions would be meaningless and likely lead to the immediate assassination of the Mexican President. So along with Bitcoin and the Yuan, the Mexican Peso may end up being a weak bridge for the ruble to the world economy.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

As the sanctions escalate, that has become more and more difficult, but it is still a consideration.

The problem with McDonalds, from what I understand from earlier posts, is that a lot of McDonalds are sort of independently owned. Not only do they provide cheap food, but taking them all away would suddenly lead to a *lot* of very ordinary Russians losing their jobs, even in small towns. 

So the sanctions aren't quite there yet, but the fact that it's a possibility is part of the threat. For the Russian higher ups, if a bunch of common Russians were to suddenly lose their jobs, they'd start looking to blame.

Maybe. This is old information, but several years ago, my parents had a friend from US military brass visit, and somehow the conversation got into what would happen in a Russia v. US conventional war. He said the expectation was that Russia would start by throwing conscripts and their worst equipment into the fight, then following up with their best troops, hoping to wear down the US by essentially using Russian soldiers and old equipment as cannon fodder.

If this was the strategy here, then we've only seen the first phase of the war. The conscripts and lower quality military equipment have been sent in and taken heavy losses, now that they have a foothold in parts of Ukraine, you'd be expecting them to send in the fresh veteran troops for the fight. We may be seeing that.

Remember the long convoy that's been approaching Kyiv and has apparently stalled? It's possible it hasn't stalled so much as is establishing a forward base where it can direct the bombardment of Kyiv. Captured airfields could serve as staging points to airlift in new, better troops. We've already seen more powerful (and indiscriminate) artillery brought in and used to level city blocks indiscriminately. 

Also, the plans the Ukraine captured seemed to indicate Moscow expected this war to take 15 days total. We're entering day 8. If the Kremlin's plan all along was to throw thousands of inexperienced troops away to ""soften Ukraine up"" then we may be about to see a sudden increase in Russian progress during this invasion.

As much as it sucks to say, Western Europe is still pretty dependent upon Russian energy. Losing that supply could massively spike prices to the point that many will no longer be able to afford them (at least not to the extent they currently can). And if it loses that, public support for Ukraine will drop off. Given that oil and gas are global commodities, the repercussions will be felt everywhere, even in regions that aren’t currently equipped to ship their products to more directly affected areas.

The analysts' positions seem to be that ultimately russia will be successful in this first battle. It will be protracted because of the stiff resistance that was setup ahead of the invasion. However, Russia will likely be successful, install their puppet government, and be fighting an insurgency for the next 30 years.  


For me personally I was with the analysts; it seemed like a doomed proposition to resist at all. But Russia chose it's worst trained, worst equipped, and least knowledgable forces, so Ukraine was able to bring the hurt to them.  Right now, in my mind, it's just a matter of supply delivery logistics on how long the Ukrainians can hold out and start gaining the upper hand.

I do think the risk of this happening is unfortunately a bit higher than many on Reddit believe it to be; limited tactical nuclear escalation is/was part of Soviet battle doctrine, so I wouldn't say it is a non-starter like many say it is, especially if they (Russia) continue to fail to meet objectives and get desperate. At that point, it would be less about taking Ukraine/making use of it and more about sending a message to the rest of the world. 

With that in mind, (and keep in mind this is my own, relatively uninformed take):

1) The use of Nukes will certainly trigger significant outrage within Russia itself - at that point it's very clear it is no longer ""de-nazification"" or whatever latest excuse they are using on their internal population that sounds politically acceptable, and I can't imagine that Russians will be happy to learn they struck first in a nuclear scenario and are now at potential of all-out MAD. This, in and of itself, has the potential to end things full-stop and lead to regime change.

2) (contrary to a lot of comments on MAD here) I don't think MAD will actually happen in such a scenario. Keep in mind (assuming they don't just walk the bomb in and rather use some large missile that we actively track), we will be able to see the missile track, identify that it is going into Ukraine, and then, the leaders of the west would have to actively determine ""yes, this is something worth ending the world for"" and give a go-ahead for counterlaunch. As shitty as it feels for me to say this to the Ukrainians, I just don't think most of the West will respond that way/say it is worth it. I do acknowledge there is certainly a chance for this, however, especially if people are on edge/have an itchy trigger finger.

3) At this point, we're kindof in uncharted territory. I do think (or perhaps better characterized as... I fervently hope that) at that point, we will see a limited conventional intervention, with point being made clear that we won't go beyond Ukraine's internationally recognized borders. It sets a **very** dangerous precedent at that point to still do no military intervention, far beyond what would ever be internationally acceptable. This does bring us pretty much to WW3 scenario with higher risk of MAD, but at this point a nuke was already launched, and for many that is the red line.

4) In this scenario, I'm near 100% certain that China will fully turn against Russia. They've already used nukes, and ... continued nuclear explosions are not conducive to Chinese self-interest, regardless of the fact that Russia is part of their anti-NATO strategy.",False,1646289347.0,t3_t5iy3q,t1_hz5guf3,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

You can't just leave the global economy after you join it, and if you get kicked out you might as well have had a couple nukes dropped on your head for the damage it will cause to your people.

That said, Russia likely wants to be able to exploit Ukraine's natural resources.

On the bright side, I don’t really think Putin has much of a motive to nuke Ukraine other than his own pride. If he really wants to conquer it, turning it to ruins would be entirely useless.

For example, I may refer to someone as far-right in the US because they are a reactionary (want to actively return things to the way they used to be), where I may refer to a person as right because they are socially conservative. I may label someone in the US as far-left because they are a radical, want to completely and quickly change the economic capitalist model. Whereas left could be someone who is progressive and wants changes to social matters.

I think where you're most confused is a notion that people you consider on the left want globalization and people in the right want independent nations, maybe even nationalism. That's also a misnomer, often used by pundits, especially in more conservative spheres. That's actually wrong, as there are varying views of globalism and nationalism and internationalism across the ""spectrum"". You hear pundits warn of ""globalists"", but it's usually a dog whistle. Free-market capitalists want globalism, because it's a term for expanding economic business unfettered across countries. Internationalism is the same, but usually encompasses a political and cultural cooperation in addition to economics. People will use it as code for a single world government, but that's not shared within labels either. You hear nationalist as a term or part of the definition for far-right, but again you can have far-left nationalists (e.g. Quebec Nationalists).

Traditionally, the right supports use of military, but that varies. When it comes to recognizing a nation's sovereignty and independent rights, that plays a Ross the spectrum as well. A person in the right could see promoting existing borders, private property and maintaining democratic conditions. Another person in the right could see a need for isolationism from world affairs or even a traditional/historical correction for a nation invading another. On the left, someone could see the importance of individual rights and opposing an authoritarian invasion. Another could see it detrimental to promote further military action.

Third, when the Ukrainians decided to help the soviets, and many resistance fighters died against the nazis, i personally lost many great aunts and uncles, Stalin said ""fuck you, you are little Russians now."" 

Four oppressed by Russia for 45 years. 

Five Chernobyl.

Six, went through the Soviet collapse. 

Seven, had their president almost murdered because he wasn't Russian enough. 

Eight, had Russia try to install a dictator. They said fuck you, and Russia invaded. 

Nine, the Russia invasion went poorly, and Ukraine contributed to improve as a country. So Russia is now trying a full scale invasion.

On currency this might work for a few weeks to a month or two, at most (unless China props him up, since they have about 20% of Russias capital reserves). And, for the coup de gras, Russia will probably have to default on its foreign debt within a month; no more debt issuance.

[Just because there’s a far-right extremist group in part of Ukraine’s military, it does NOT justify Putin invading and attacking the ENTIRE country of Ukraine.](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/03/02/what-is-ukraines-azov-battalion/) 

Knowing that Putin felt like he could get away with this in Ukraine makes me feel like he could get away with this in many other places. My heart goes out for all the people in Ukraine. So much unnecessary death. 

My heart also goes out to all the Russians who wish they could have a voice but who are getting arrested for protesting. I hope they will be able to withstand these severe sanctions without much suffering.

Putin is out of control, he has no checks and balances in his government. Mostly all officials in his circle are afraid of telling him no. He has control of nukes. His crazy actions are worrying not just for Ukraine but the entire world, including Russia.

It makes me want to do something even though I’m in the other side of the world. The internet is powerful as a tool for information and this is very much a misinformation war for those in Russia. Putin has even banned using the word invasion in his news. I believe that the internet communities could accomplish something together if they bring their minds together. For example, perhaps the internet could help Russians who believe this war is justified to realize that it is not.",False,1646286861.0,t3_t5iy3q,t1_hz5d8zf,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Source is David Satter, an US journalist who spent decades covering Russian politics and was one of the first people to claim that President Putin and the FSB may have been involved with the terrorist attack. 


>David Satter: In the summer of 1999 the approval rating of former President Yeltsin was 2%. **There appeared to be no chance whatever that Putin, who was designated by Yeltsin as his successor could possibly become the next Russian president. The apartment bombings changed everything. It was said after those buildings went up that now we're living in a completely different country.***

I got very, very little that was of any use. **But I did get a few documents from the state department which indicated that their sources of information were telling them that the apartment bombings were extremely suspicious.** You had to be deaf, dumb, and blind not to see what was going on. And in particular **you had to be willfully ignorant if you didn't see the implications of the Ryazan incident in which three FSB agents were arrested for putting a fifth bomb in a building, even though the bomb didn't go off it was a live bomb.

The ships have both bow- and stern-doors for loading and unloading vehicles, and the 630 square metres (6,800 sq ft) of vehicle deck stretches the length of the hull.

Listening to one of the retired Generals today, that convoy sounds like it could become a logistical nightmare.

With so many sanctions, Putin may have more problems at home to worry about soon than invading what he thinks is like ""sudaten"" type land, but doesnt understand the world has moved on from post ww2.

The General was saying Rus does not have enough troops if it gets sucked into a city, it will end up as mass casualties on there end. Im no guru but makes sense, look what happened in Stalingrad in ww2.

The problem is now he has no political way to save face, as reported by some he has just commited to a 10 year battle. Regardless of time frame, by the time they get close to winning the sanctions will have reduced Rus to complete 3rd world and mass starvation. The poor young folk, with all the promise of 1991 it never arrived and now similar the new 20 somethings will live through a world of misery.

It's natural for other competing countries to refuse to interact with athletes who represent a country that is repeatedly ignoring condemnation and violating international laws.

It becomes emotionally charged. Recall the infamous Hungary vs USSR polo match of the 1956 Olympics.

Should Hungary have refused to play allowing the USSR passage to the final? 

It's a shame in many instances that this punishes the athletes (unlike tennis (for example) where the athletes can still compete but not under the banner of their country).

Perhaps a better approach would be to allow Paralympic athletes - from countries that have had their representative status rescinded - to compete under a white flag with NO OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE STATUS.

The sanctions were imposed by the United States, the European Union (EU) and other countries and international organisations against individuals, businesses and officials from Russia and Ukraine. Russia responded with sanctions against a number of countries, including a total ban on food imports from Australia, Canada, Norway, Japan, the United States and the European Union.

Most Arab countries that have been freed like Libya, Afghanistan before the retake, have massive corruption, tribal infighting for power, energy cuts and increased cost of living for the people, and militias that pillage and rape local populaces, not to mention breeding grounds for isis and other terrorist groups which cause more instability. 

A big reason why Afghanistan fell so quickly was due to the massive corruption from the government so the inflated military spending on paper was no where near as strong as real life. Same thing would happen to Iraq if the USA left (Libya split in 2, taliban won in Afghanistan, a dictator returned to Egypt etc). Eventually people get fed up and want a dictator back in most of these countries, Egypt for example with Sisi and the warlord in Libya almost taking the capitol if not for Turkish intervention.

Democracy needs to be fostered independently by the people of the country like it was in the western world, ousting a dictator leaves a vacuum that will only get filled by corrupt power hungry politicians who play the system. And eventually a dictator takes over unless the USA wants to spend multiple generations stabilizing a country and we’re back to step 1 (Egypt, Afghanistan).

 >Iraq actively researched and later employed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) from 1962 to 1991, when it destroyed its chemical weapons stockpile and halted its biological and nuclear weapon programs as required by the United Nations Security Council. The fifth President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was internationally condemned for his use of chemical weapons during the 1980s campaign against Iranian and Kurdish civilians during and after the Iran–Iraq War. In the 1980s, Saddam pursued an extensive biological weapons program and a nuclear weapons program, though no nuclear bomb was built.

 >The economy of Russia is a mixed economy, with enormous natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas. It is the fifth-largest economy in Europe, the world's eleventh-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the sixth-largest by PPP. Russia's vast geography is an important determinant of its economic activity, with some sources estimating that the nation contains over 30% of the world's natural resources. In 2016, the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 36% of federal budget revenues.

I would be curious to see the rest of the distribution for Russia though. The middle class in the US now holds a lesser share of the wealth than they did 30 years ago! 

2021 data: 

“10 percent of the richest people in the United States own almost 70 percent of the country’s total wealth.

The top 1 percent held about half of that wealth – 32.1 percent, while the next 9 percent held approximately another half at 37.7 percent.

I haven’t looked closely at Russia’s data, but I would imagine it’s because wealth is more evenly spread in the bottom 99% of the population than it is in the US. So ignore the ultra rich in both places (top 1%), it’s possible that poor, middle, and upper middle have a more normal distribution of the wealth in Russia, while in the US the top 10% of people hold 70% of the wealth. 

There’s some good 2021 US data here:

“The richest 10% of Russians own 87% of all the country’s wealth, according to the report, compared with 76% in the US and 66% in China.”

The Gini index focuses on income, so russia must be a bit better than us on income inequality but worse on wealth distribution? I wouldn’t say they are in an entirely different stratosphere than the US though.

Simple answer, because while the USA isn't perfect and has made many errors, they're ability and willingness to go places and do things has deterred far more issues than it's created.

Go spend some time looking up how many bordering countries hate each other and how many wars they were in prior to 1970s...

the fact that nato began including countries part of the warsaw pact (in simple terms, a sort of ""enemy"" of nato) was a needless provocation of russia, and hence this expansion eventually led to russia having a fear that nato would eventually surround them and become a hostile aggressor.

it's also important to note that the warsaw pact was dissolved while nato was not, and hence also important to understand how nato's arrogant and tone-deaf policy and their expansion eastward despite analysts warning the us against it have contributed majorly to this war.

now, let's consider the case where ukraine is part of nato. nato becomes a hostile aggressor, just as russia feared. according to article 5 of the north atlantic treaty, an attack against one is an attack against all. now, nato can take out of context certain actions russia does, and claims that russia has attacked a nato country. then, they seem to have the justification to invade russia. and when they actually invade russia, the fact that ukraine is part of nato makes the job so much easier for them. in this case, defending russia is absolutely hopeless and their only chance of survival is retreating.

for the case of north korea, the reason nobody invades (from my understanding, at least) is that they would be making an unjustified attack. north korea hasn't invaded anyone, and human rights isnt a good enough justification of invading north korea. i hope nk isnt dumb enough to use the nukes. however, in the unlikely case that they are, the few nukes aren't a problem, especially if the us invades.

why would anyone attack russia now? first is probably their oil and gas reserves. why buy it when you can take it and make more money? second is the north sea trade route. ice is melting, and having the trade route would make so much money, since essentially everyone will go via that route (travel times are much shorter)",False,1646292207.0,t3_t5iy3q,t1_hz5hfib,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

He would never have survived the KGB work with the attitude he has right now. He was, before this, very calculating and, despite open hostilities he initiated, actually played quite close to the chest in all engagements. Like the entire Russo-Georgian war being a front to get a toehold in Georgia, ban *all* of their targets from NATO, and clear weapons caches from all of them. He had a good eye for how much he could get away with, hence Crimea. Hence Luhansk and Donetsk. Even if he only gets a clear route from Russia to Crimea, he will have gotten what I believe he wanted from this. Obviously, getting all of Ukraine would be *better*, and in his current state better is best, perhaps, but he really just needs a controlled land route to the sea, in my humble internet idiot opinion. I think that's why he committed with more immediate fire and fury to Kharkiv than to Kyiv. Kyiv is a side goal because obviously the clearest route would be a completely controlled Ukraine. But if he can get the southern coast up to Donetsk, that's a clear route. He's also engaged pretty heavily in Mariupol and Melitopol for I think the same reasons. If he can't take all of Ukraine, he'll take a little path along the coast of the Sea of Azov to Crimea, and maybe get a really tidy treaty out of it.

The extent to which he's over engaged in Ukraine kinda point to Macron being right, though. He's losing it. And he's taking Ukraine *and Russia* down with him.

What's happening now isn't a significant difference from the Putinism of the last 30 years. There hasn't been any communism, even soviet-style, in Russia- it's used in name alone. The country has exhibited martial law for decades, it just hasn't been officially declared. Putinism has been closer to the concept of fascism in all aspects, the nation controls business but in the interest of the business owners. ""Nationalizing"" industry will still result in profits to the small number of oligarchs. Closing the markets is an economic control, as a reaction to sanctions, to keep the oligarch money safe and prevent collapse of business. but it wouldn't be the first time the Putin regime has controlled the economy to control market prices or support their war efforts. For example, Russia put trade limits on wheat a year ago, not as a measure to redistribute to their people, but to raise prices in the international market so they could begin stockpiling in case if sanctions (probably to prepare for this war).",False,1646293016.0,t3_t5iy3q,t1_hz5fsbp,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

And, perhaps surprisingly, they were aware of this relationship and made consciously use of it to further their aims. Thus “planning” had indeed a very different meaning in the Nazi state from that in the Soviet Union. It is therefore not at all astonishing that this was often emphasized by contemporaries from many quarters.74 The greatest difference to a centrally planned economy, however, was the role private ownership of firms had to play in the economy – in practice as well as in theory. The ideal Nazi economy would liberate the creativeness of a multitude of private entrepreneurs in a dominantly competitive framework gently directed by the state to achieve the highest welfare of the Germanic people. But this “directed market economy”, as it was called, had not yet been perfected because of the exigencies of war.

Go read Cloudflare's quarterly DDOS reports; especially around the time there were major 'operations' happening. One notorious one that comes to mind is Q2 2011 (the Lulzsec thing.) There were specific targets, but it still affected overall internet health. There is a tremendous amount of work that's done to mitigate it as best as possible, but it still causes network congestion. This affects how long it takes to be able to reach sites and establish connections more than anything else. This is usually what people mean when they talk about slowdown.

The name should imply to you that the internet is a Network. It is multiple computers connected together. They are purpose-built computers with purpose-written software that exclusively handle traffic, routing, switching and so on, but it is still effectively just a network of computers. There is always a point of failure somewhere along the line, but we tend to take for granted that there are a lot of fucking interconnected parallel lines connecting to the same places in the modern world.
