Some deserters have been tracked down by a “cleaning crew,” fellow mercenaries, who executes the mia-mercenaries for attempting to go home or otherwise refusing to further fight.

He claims that the mercenaries all know this will happen—execution occur *in front of* recruits—which is why they quietly try to sneak off—those who’ve been tracked down have called loved ones to say goodbye, that they’re being executed.

Day 296 of my updates from Kharkiv.

And today was yet another day that started with explosions in the morning, a lot of them too. There were about 10 S-300 missiles fired at Kharkiv’s energy infrastructure in the span of an hour starting at about 8:40am. The electricity went out almost immediately after the first explosions, with water and mobile internet disappearing shortly after.

We thought that it might take a lot of time to get it fixed this time, but it wasn’t actually that bad, because electricity was already getting turned back on in Kharkiv oblast about 6 hours after the missile strike happened, and then a bit later our governor said that electricity should be fixed by the end of the day. For us personally electricity was fixed after 9 hours, which is extremely fast considering the damage that was done. 

We actually think that those public announcements about a lot of damage being done to our infrastructure right after a missile strike happens might be intentional, and aimed at Russia, because they are the ones that said they want to let us fix the damage before doing another missile strike. So, by publicly saying that everything is going horrible for us it could stop further missile strikes for the day, because Russians would think that their job is done and no further missiles are required right away.

> Today in Bangui there was a terrorist act against the Russian humanitarian mission. The head of the Russian House, Dmitry Syty, received a package containing an explosive that detonated in his hands.

>We will provide details as information becomes available.

>Prigojine's reaction was immediate. He accuses France of having committed the attack, and claims to have asked the MID to initiate a procedure for recognition of France as a State sponsor of terrorism.

Tweet includes a screenshot of a message from Prigozhin on VK, already translated:

># 1020 We publish a statement by Evgeny Viktorovich: ""In the Central African Republic, which for hundreds of years was oppressed by the French, who destroyed the population and stole the wealth of the CAR, on February 1, 2022, the Russian House was opened. It was headed by the patriot of Russia and the Central African Republic Dmitry Syty.

>On November 11, Dmitry Sytom from Togo received a parcel with a photo of his son living in France. There was a note that said that next time he will get the head of his son, if ""the Russians do not get out of the African continent and open the door for the French."" He received the package again today. Despite all the instructions for the observance of security measures, Dmitry Syty, being in a state of affect and thinking that in the parcel the head of his son, opened it. There was an explosion.

>At the moment, the life of Dmitry Syty is under great question. Russian doctors are doing everything possible in Bangui hospital to save him. Before losing consciousness, Dmitry Syty managed to say: ""I saw a note: ""This is for you from all the French, the Russians will get out of Africa.""

>I have already appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation to initiate the procedure for declaring France a state sponsor of terrorism, as well as conducting a thorough investigation of the terrorist methods of France and its Western allies - the United States and others. If Dmitry Syty remains alive, he will continue the struggle and see with his own eyes how in the flame of history those who attempted to kill him will burn. If he dies, he will forever be a symbol of this struggle. No Russian will ever retreat from the African continent until all the colonizers have removed themselves from the borders of their countries.

However, even in the last 2 days, people do discuss things that you link to in live thread, and it gives some discussion topics. For example, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1603363378138959873) from the thread led to a bunch of people discussing it. 

If you do wind down the live feed, I would come up with a list of places where people can get info, like ISW's website, Ukrainian news sites, official Ukrainian government, OSINT accounts like Defmon3, Warmonitor3, Oryx, Tatarigami_UA, Rob Lee, Andrew Perpetua, Ukrainian's on the ground like Sofia Ukaini and Special Kherson cat and a bunch of others and just have that be the post. 

IMHO, while nice, there isn't really a need for the live thread. If you need to stop for your mental health, or to move on to something else I would understand.

Finally, I don't see why the live feed can't come back if say Ukraine launches another major counteroffensive. 

TLDR: I do read the feed, it does give some discussion topics, but it isn't really necessary if you don't feel up to it. If you need to wind it down for the holidays or when nothing is going besides positional trench warfare, then feel free.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.

The kits incorporate global positioning devices for precision and can be bolted onto a variety of weapons, creating what the Pentagon calls a Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM. The U.S. military has used the technology on bombs weighing up to 2,000 pounds, usually incorporating it with bomber aircraft and fighter jets.

It was not immediately clear whether President Biden or any of his top national security advisers have approved the proposed JDAMs’ transfer to Ukraine. Those familiar with matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations, did not say whether Ukrainian forces would employ the kits on aircraft or ground-based weapons, or what specific systems in Ukraine’s arsenal would be candidates for such augmentation.

Pentagon eyes major expansion of Ukraine military training

The Ukrainian Air Force relies primarily on aging Soviet-era MiG jets, and the Pentagon has sought ways to upgrade them rather than provide newer Western aircraft that would require its pilots and maintainer units to undertake complicated new training.

The Biden administration has previously equipped Ukraine with other advanced weaponry, including air-launched high-speed, antiradiation missiles, or HARMs, to enhance Ukraine’s ability to carry out airstrikes. But those weapons function differently than the GPS-guided JDAM, instead hunting radiation emitted by Russian units and headquarters.

A delivery of JDAMs would mark another significant step by Washington to help Ukraine repel the invading Russian force, providing a new way to target Russian units and headquarters. Since June, Ukraine has relied heavily on the U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, another precision system, for significant casualties among Russian troops and disruption of supply lines, Ukrainian and U.S. officials have said.

Pentagon preparing to send Patriot missile system to Ukraine

The Kremlin has reacted angrily to the outpouring of Western military aid, making thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and warning of the potential for a broader spillover war with NATO. For that reason, the Biden administration has sought to move cautiously in approving new capabilities that could be viewed by Russia as escalatory.

On Tuesday, senior U.S. officials told The Washington Post that the Pentagon also was preparing to provide Ukraine with a Patriot missile system, the U.S. military’s most sophisticated air defense weapon. Biden has yet to approve that move either but could do so imminently, officials said.

Ukrainian leaders have pleaded for help bolstering their air defenses as Russia has carried out a relentless assault on the country’s electrical grid, disabling heat for much of the population as the winter cold arrives. Delivery of a Patriot, which relies on radars and long-range missiles to intercept incoming threats, would fulfill one of Ukraine’s biggest and most frequent requests of Washington.

To date, the United States has committed about $20 billion in security aid to Ukraine since the invasion began Feb. 24.

Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said Monday that the administration is focused on “blunting any Russian effort” to gain an advantage in the war, and predicted the United States would announce new arms transfers soon.",False,1671183511.0,t3_zn5iig,t1_j0faaoh,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

I am sure it (Ukraine getting into NATO) will happen eventually but I wouldn't bet on it happening within two years. Nor four years. For one thing, it can't happen while Russia is in Ukraine and I don't see Ukraine stopping the war and giving up territory to hasten entry to NATO. So we wait until Russia leaves. *That* might take more than two years. From that time until getting into NATO can happen will be several more years at an absolute minimum, then add on extra time to strongarm Orban (or whatever replaces him) and his kind, plus the remaining secret tankies in the EU governments, plus getting over all the hurdles that Russia will put in the way, and they will throw every obstacle they can at it.

Look at how hard it has been to get Sweden and Finland in; they're still not there - even with all the countries more or less lining up now, it will still be ages yet until they're in. Multiply those problems by many times, there's many hurdles.

But the fate of people in Ukraine is by no means comparable to those of the Jews in WO2. Ethnic cleansing is not really that special. Many countries have been guilty of that. Evil for sure. But the energy and effort that the Nazis put in it makes it stand out. Not even talking about how they did it and why. Say what you want but Russia is not doing something that is even remotely similar. At least up till now. You may want to be it so to get the point across how bad Russia is. I understand that up to some point. But it is also a kind of propaganda that implicates that the Ukrainians of today are the Jews of yesterday. That though is simply not true.
