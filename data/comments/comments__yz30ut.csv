Day 269 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, but there were a couple of missile launches from Belgorod around 4pm, they weren’t aimed at Kharkiv, but at Kupiansk, or at least in its direction. We don’t know where it landed exactly, and there were no reports of explosions from anywhere, but Kupiansk has been getting hit regularly after it was liberated, it is being both shelled and hit with missiles.

It’s not getting talked about much, but the border regions in Russia actually get shelled by our forces *a lot.* There are constant reports in Belgorod’s and Kursk’s telegram channels about their villages and towns either getting destroyed by shelling or losing electricity, because we do target their substations in retaliation, at least the ones that we can reach. 

The villages and towns that get targeted by our forces are most of the time evacuated and being used by the Russian military, so they can’t claim that we are targeting civilians. It’s funny how they were accusing us of using civilians as shields while we were protecting our cities from being overrun by the Russian horde, but then they turn around and do the exact thing they were accusing us of. 

There is also one very important distinction in those two situations. When our forces were fighting off Russians from inside of our cities they *had to be there,* because if there were no soldiers in them, then Russians would simply enter and capture them. But Russians don’t need to be inside of their own towns and cities to defend them, nobody is going to enter Russia and try to capture their cities, so they are using their own civilian infrastructure to attack us from, when they don’t have to do it.

Democratically elected leaders really, really don’t like to do things that nobody is asking them to do. They also love to do things that almost everybody is asking them to do. If a democratically elected leader has something that they think needs doing, step one is generating public support. 



What autocrats don’t get is that criticizing a democratically elected leader isn’t a bad thing, or even something that leader doesn’t want. Citizens in democracies have a duty to criticize their leaders. Autocrats don’t abide criticism. All criticism is a negative, something to be stomped out, and they think that we are the same.


The agents of authoritarianism love finding things that democratic citizens are arguing about and trying to stoke that criticism with negative emotions, trying to enrage and divide us. And they have some success. But most of us appreciate that a healthy debate is what moves public opinion, and in turn generates the political room to maneuver that our leaders need to enact those changes.



I see a whole lot of that going on in regard to this war. I see it in regard to urging Germany to take a more active role in global security than they have in 75 years. I see it in urging Israel to be more generous with their military technology. And I see it in encouraging the US to provide more kinds of weapons.



I encourage President Biden to supply Ukraine with fighter jets and long-range missiles. I give President Biden the political room to maneuver if he decides to do that. I do not call him a weak, spineless, appeaser for not having done so already.



Israel has the political room to maneuver and provide arms to Ukraine now, thanks to the pressure from citizens. But imagine if Israel had been an enthusiastic and prolific supporter before there has been any criticism. Their support would have looked very different. Same story with Germany. If Germany had switched from their post-WWII relative isolationist stance to an aggressively outward-looking stance before any criticism? They would be perceived very differently today.



So keep up the good work, y’all. Keep the pressure on. Our leaders need and appreciate the room to maneuver. Just watch out for the ass-holes who try to turn our valid criticisms in to a negative emotion. We criticize because we care. And if we don’t get what we want? It’s probably because not enough of us want it and we haven’t generated enough political room for it yet.",False,1668884707.0,t3_yz30ut,t3_yz30ut,,0,79,0,79,0,0,

* https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60901024

Now (after Ukraine successfully eliminated at least 30,000 Russians and de-occupied some territories) the Russians want negotiations to temporarily freeze the war. They do this in order to better prepare for an effective attack. It is so obvious that even Russian media write about it (not Ukrainian media). 

https://meduza.io/amp/en/feature/2022/10/14/why-russia-is-pushing-a-return-to-negotiations

Of course, Russia will not attack if someone like NATO/UN sends peacekeepers to Ukraine, but such a scenario is impossible. This is because politicians are cowards and giving Russian terrorists a veto is stupid. 

Russians can just leave the territory of Ukraine and forget about everything. No one needs their Belgorod or what garbage they have. Ukraine is the victim in the war, and Russia is the attacker. If the attacker just leaves Ukraine, Russia will probably not be punished in any way and the war will end. It is cynical, but it is true

So the US spends around 500 billion per year to prepare for a fight against Russia and China at the same time, if you want to view it like that.

We are watching one of those countries get crushed by a fraction of that spending. The other gets to watch what a fraction of that spending can do against their strongest ally. The west helped a country with a semi functioning military 7 years ago and helped turn it into an absolute monster.

f844f85e8af5961b5432bfee81bf0e0e,yz30ut,iwyxwzs,"Great article. One thing, its not fully correct with the numbers.  If you examine bills, then you will find out that Ukraine did not get all 66 billon from bills with Ukraine aid. 

Ukraine military assistance to this date is around ~18 billon usd. This is estimate of services, weapons, training and intelligence provided to Ukraine since war have begun. There is also about ~12 billons in economic and relief aid, and around 3-4 billions usd in aid to countries that are helping Ukraine. Probably paying for weapon swaps, training, ect. 

That is a lot of money, but still not 66 billion that is mentioned. Because rest is dedicated to replenishing Pentagon and US military weapons arsenal and other things. It means that a lot of money go in to US economy and are used to rearm and expand weapons production, creating more jobs and better weapons for US army. US right now sends gear and weapons from existing arsenal, makes new orders for UA aid in the future (like NASAMS and HIMARS, that are to be delivered), buys soviet tech from allies, and replaces it with US made tech (thus making US NATO allies stronger). 

Overall US sends weapons that were created to fight Russia. These weapons are now doing what they were made to do.  And in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers, these weapons perform extremely well. 

Lethal help from US helps Ukraine safe lives, it helps Ukraine fight against genocidal war of agression started by Russia, and it helps to uphold international order, sending clear message to all other tyranical regimes, keeping them at bay. 

If Ukraine falls, or defeated, many countries will try to get nukes to guarantee their existence.  Future of nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament is in danger. All tyranic regimes will see this as a defeat of the west and US, and think its good time to redraw more borders. International law will mean nothing, global instability will rise even more, and horrible precedent will lead to more unstable, unsafe world.

So it is truly great deal for US to weaken Russia. Right now US demilitarizes Russia for a fraction it would cost in direct war. With more than [8000k](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) visually confirmed Russian equipment destroyed, with over 100k of KIA and WIA, Russia will be much weaker at the end of this war, then they ever was. Return on investment is crazy for US, because every Russian tank, every IFV, plane, missile destroyed in Ukraine, is one less to worry about  if they decide to threat NATO allies in the region. US is getting bargain of the century, and gets to weaken #2 geopolitical opponent, without using US military blood.

But now conservatives are talking about how more than 100 billion will be spent ON Ukraine, which is simply not true. They are imagening that Ukraine gets all 100 billion of these money, which is not the case. 

Again not all the money in the [bills](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-40-billion-aid-ukraine-buy) like 
these goes to Ukraine (read the bills people), some money even left unspent (i do not know why), besides up until this date, US have not sent a single western tank, heavy IFV, plane, or heavy drone to Ukraine. I hope that changes. 

US helps Ukraine a lot. But its important to say how much really spent on Ukraine, and how weakening of Russia benefits US and their allies. Russia army needs heavy rebuilding and years to restore what they have lost, which means that they will not be a threat to NATO allies in the region. A huge win for US.",1668864099.0,1668862808.0,t3_yz30ut,t1_iwyv1f1,,1,53,0,53,0,0,

Zelensky is a Nazi holding his people captive. Yet when his people is suffering unbearably, he will call Olaf Scholz to ask for negotiations with Russia. So he's a Nazi/war criminal, holding his people captive, but cares enough about them to decide to engage with Russia?

I continue to suggest there should be an emphasis on logistics.  Extensive rail lines on European guage would be useful post war and also critical in a long war.  

Pipelines move liquid faster and more efficiently than rail and much more efficiently than trucks.  They can be targeted same as the electrical grid.  

Replacing transformers as they get hit might be a best option.  That becomes a race between Russia's missile production and western electrical industry.  The midsiles might be more expensive.  

Electric cars could stabilize local power.  Intermittent energy flows can recharge the batteries.  

If you want high tech solutions try solid oxide fuel cells.  [like this one](https://www.ensolsystems.com/products/sunfire-solid-oxide-fuel-cells/).  They can run on natural gas or propane.

An earlier battle in May 2014 had left Donetsk International Airport in Ukrainian control. Despite a ceasefire agreement, the Minsk Protocol, in place starting 5 September 2014, fighting broke out between Donetsk People's Republic forces affiliated with Russia, and Ukrainian military and volunteer forces. At the start of the battle, the airport lay between the separatist and Ukrainian lines of control, and was the last part of Donetsk city held by Ukrainian government forces.

US provides a lot of aid. But its not 100$ billion at this date, that you mentioned.

The rest goes to US DoD and Pentagon, and other programs, for example, to build new weapons.

Here is [great](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-40-billion-aid-ukraine-buy) summary of 40 billion bill, in which, as you can see not all 40 billions are dedicated for Ukraine.

They have to sell it, as they don't have the storage capacity to keep that oil for later. Expanding their storage capacity is a lengthy ad difficult process, and costs a lot of money.

So what they extract they have to sell.

If they choose to sell less, they need to stop production, and as many have explained before, if they close a well, that well will stay shut for a long time, and there's no way around it.

So they will definitely sell, and at a hefty discount, because there isn't anyone out there capable of absorbing what they currently produce indefinitely.

And if they can sell it, they'll have to find a way to ship that oil, and that's the trick the devil did, nobody is likely to ensure their ships.

There is also 3.9 billion to pay for more US deployments in Europe, and other stuff.

But as of today, according to numbers released by US gov. They have delievered about 18 billions of military aid, and commited to delivering 12 billions of economic aid.

They also have limited numbers of launching platforms. It's like saying you don't need HIMARS because you've got Excalibur rounds. No, you need both. They have more or less the same job but different capacities that need to be layered together. Getting anti-radiation loitering munitions could make Russian air defence almost impossible rather than simply risky. If Russian Air Defence is down then large Ukrainian drones can operate near the frontlines and give local air and ISTAR superiority which is what will give Ukraine battlefield dominance and lead to unsustainable attrition for Russian forces.

NASAM's is extremely limited in number and range, this is NASAMS and IRIS-T coverage combined: [https://twitter.com/ukraine\_map/status/1562696618075308032](https://twitter.com/ukraine_map/status/1562696618075308032)  Everything else is covered by older Soviet Systems and their fighters. What they need to be able to do is push the Russia fighters back and give space for Ukrainian air support over the frontlines. If you actually listen to what the Ukrainian pilots are saying, more than Western airframes it's the advanced Western missiles that they need. The Russian jets have a massive advantage there and can pop off missiles from ranges that the Ukrainian's can't respond to. The easiest way to combat that is to give them both Western Missiles and Western Aircraft that have the weapons integrated. 

Saying that long-range strike is off the table because it's not useful is just putting a 100m tall billboard out there saying ""I don't know what I'm talking about"". S-400 systems are out of HIMARS range. Russian airfields are out of HIMARS range. Logistical chokepoints like the Kerch Bridge are out of HIMARS range. The Russian's have dispersed their ammo dumps and concealed their command centers near the front lines now so HIMARS is less effective.

In all fairness its never been about those either... well not since Barry Goldwater anyways, and even as the grandfather of modern libertarianism he was a real POS as far as conservative stuff goes. While he mellowed out in his old age he is one of the people who we can thank for the types and levels of extremism we can see in the modern republican party now. Either way, all of those talking points are just abstraction of other wholly dysfunctional core ideologies. 

US, or otherwise stated right wing libertarianism as an extension of conservative ideation has always been about wanting to have all of the benefits of the social contract that maintains communities, but not wanting to contribute anything towards it, nor wanting to be bound by the rules that come with it. Same shit as many conservatives get in to about not wanting to pay in to systems that benefit everyone because someone they dislike might benefit from such too.

>I still strongly hold those values but within context and with caveats as the whole 'movement' has gone batshit crazy in the last decade or so.

Honestly they have been that since the 80-90s or so when libertarianism ala Barry Goldwater got mingled with neoliberalism, and conservative ideation stemming from southern strategy era abstraction of shit like racism in rhetoric and policy positions.(Thus we got all of the complaints about taxes being theft, and individual accountability as the default talking point in opposition to social support systems.)

They were in the cross fire. All it takes is for one Rambo and runner for the RPK to mow them all down. As I am sure they were warned when Ukrainians found them. They were letting them surrender. It turned into a fake surrender.
