Day 64 & 65 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday most of the day was mostly quiet, but around 8 pm shelling started to intensify and it sounded very close, by the sound of it they were shooting at us from howitzers. Explosions were not constant, but they were very powerful, our windows shook after every explosion, thankfully they didn’t break, any more of them breaking would be horrible.

While today our forces liberated Ruska Lozova, from where my district was allegedly being shelled, the shelling didn’t actually stop. In fact we have been under shelling for the past 4-5 hours and our building is shaking with each explosion. Though right now at the time of posting the shelling isn’t as bad anymore, maybe it will actually be somewhat quiet tonight.

This is such a mindless war; Russians are destroying everything that they are supposedly trying to “protect” in Ukraine and they are still continuing to spew their bullshit while doing it, even when most of the world doesn’t buy it, and I’m really glad that they don’t. 

Honestly the amount of support our country is getting is absolutely mind blowing, and we are really grateful for it, if not for all this support we wouldn’t have much chance of winning this war. Lend-Lease being revived almost unanimously to stop Russia is just amazing. 

All this makes it especially funny when Russians on their state TV literally call “the West” a “collective Hitler” have they looked in the mirror recently? They are literally threatening to nuke the whole world almost every day and at the same time they are saying that it’s everyone else who’s wrong. What the hell is this bullshit? Why can’t Russia just be normal for once and accept that they are in the wrong?

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres discussed evacuating civilians from Mariupol when he met Zelensky on Thursday.  
  
Guterres said intense discussions were under way to enable the evacuation of the Azovstal steel plant - the last part of the city not under Russian control - which has been pounded by Russian forces.

Ukrainians had been attacking north of Kharkiv towards the border crossing at Zhuravlevka, which is on the main road between Belgorad (main Russian supply site) and Kharkiv. They weren't able to take the border crossing, but they did get at least partial control of a secondary road that goes NW from Kharkiv through the town of Derhachi, which then loops NE to Zhuravlevka.

The importance of Ruska Lozova is that it's right on that main highway (E105) between Belgorad and Kharkiv, and it means that the Ukrainians would have at least partial control of the two main roads leading north from Kharkiv to Zhuravlevka.

If the Ukrainians can take Zhuravlevka, or at least control the area around it near the border, that could put the main road which goes SE from Belgorod (which is one way the Russians are moving supplies to support the Izyum line of attack) within range of Ukrainian artillery. (From my eyeballing of the map, it looks like that road going SE from Belgorod is within 20-25 miles of the area around Zhuravlevka.)

On Ukraine, the author considered it a geopolitical pivot point (that is, ""because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia""). It's necessary for Moscow to gain in order to be an imperial Eurasian power vs a cornered (e.g., facing resistance from Central Asia + China) Asian imperial state.

Ukraine's independence and the breakup of the USSR posed an existential crisis to the Russian people (who is the face of the pan-Slavic identity? What happens when all these countries develop their own identities? What are the consequences of losing these areas?) Losing Ukraine, for example, meant losing significant industrial/agricultural/trade (e.g., Odesa & Black Sea) power for the Soviets/Russia. Russia went from an imperial great power to the head of a large ideological bloc to... collapsing into a country surrounded on all sides by potential enemies with no good resources and a bunch of barren land... A geopolitical crisis on top of an identity crisis.

The elites of post-Soviet Russia wanted to, obviously, keep Russia's role as that power player in the region. The West, especially the United States, understood an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia hence their repudiation of Russia's integration wishes and their support for these new independent states. This resulted in the West continually being held in contempt by Moscow and Ukraine being viewed as a complete aberration/abomination/temporary phenomenon waiting to sort itself out by Moscow.

Ukraine's identity in this process developed a distinct anti-Russia taste to it because their politicians saw that Russia's actions and rhetoric were designed to undermine the legitimacy and practical existence (e.g., borders, Crimea, etc) of an independent Ukrainian state and identity and the move towards a European identity vs a Russian-centred one.

The point being? The book puts it best.

>... **Russia will find it incomparably harder to acquiesce in Ukraine's accession to NATO, for to do so would be to acknowledge that Ukraine's destiny is no longer organically linked to Russia's**... Russia's acceptance of these links would then define Russia's own decision to be also truly a part of Europe. Russia's refusal would be tantamount to therejection of Europe in favor of a solitary ""Eurasian"" identity and existence...  
>  
>.**..Russia cannot be in Europe without Ukraine also being in Europe, whereas Ukraine can be in Europe without Russia being in Europe**... Indeed, Ukraine's relationship to Europe could be the turning point for Russia itself. But that also means that the **defining moment for Russia's relationship to Europe** is still some time off—""defining"" in the sense that Ukraine's choice in favor of Europe will bring to a head Russia's decision regarding the next phase of its history: **either to be a part of Europe as well or to become a Eurasian outcast, neither truly of Europe nor Asia and mired in its ""near abroad"" conflicts.**  
>  
>...The states deserving America's strongest geopolitical support are Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and (outside this region) Ukraine, all three being geopolitically pivotal.

*Putin commonly accuses his victims of his own crimes to deflect attention from his real objectives. Hence, he accuses the Jewish Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of being a Nazi while behaving curiously like Hitler; and he speaks of denazification in Ukraine when Russia is arguably the most fascist state in the world.*  
  
*Like Hitler’s Germany and Mussolini’s Italy, Russia is ruled by an authoritarian strongman with a cult of personality, who hypnotizes his followers through the endless repetition of lies. Russia is similarly dependent on extralegal militias, which it uses to indoctrinate the youth and to police protests. The militias played a major role in fighting in the Donbas and were used to police Crimea in 2014 when Putin sent a biker gang funded by the state to patrol the streets. Finally, Russia is a revanchist state, which means it seeks to win back former imperial possessions to reclaim its former greatness.*

“The sanctions are our most important means of pressure against the Russian regime” and it is “crucial that we stand with the EU and other countries to continue to weaken Russia's ability to finance the war in Ukraine,” she said.

A news release from the Norwegian government announced that starting on May 7, “there will be a ban on port calls for Russian-flagged vessels,” including commercial ships, yachts, some pleasure craft and recreational vessels.

Due to the special agreement between Norway and Russia on the management and conservation of fish stocks in the Barents Sea, the ban will not include fishing vessels, search and rescue vessels or research vessels, according to the news release. 

“The ban on freight transport by road will apply to transport companies established in Russia and apply immediately,” the news release added.

Propaganda, even when you know it is wrong information, is still very dangerous. There are studies demonstrating that you can tell people a list of statements, directly tell them that some of the statements are wrong, and then ask them a few weeks later if the statements are true or not, and they will be more likely to report the incorrect statements as correct than those who were never previously exposed.

Basically, exposure increases your familiarity to the statements unconsciously. You can't consciously form a source memory every time to remember that the statement is incorrect. You seek meaning for this increase in familiarity (aka fluency in processing) and often attribute the statement as being true due to its cognitive ease in processing.

Kostiantyn Nemichev, an official at the Kharkiv Regional State Administration and a member of the Azov regiment, said Ukrainian forces had liberated the settlement of Ruska Lozova, which is just north of Kharkiv. In recent weeks, the Ukrainians say they've liberated several towns and villages in the area. 

""This is a strategically important settlement located on the Kharkiv-Belgorod highway. It was from this suburb, during the occupation, that the enemy fired at the civilian infrastructure and housing estates of Kharkiv,"" Nemichev said.

Nemichev's comments were echoed by the Ukrainian military, which said Friday that the town had been liberated by the assault unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. 

The Russians, however, are still able to shell Kharkiv and its immediate surroundings. 

Oleh Syniehubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said the intensity of shelling had lessened. ""However, it's still quite dangerous to be outside in the streets. Unfortunately, we record civilian deaths every day,"" he said.

""Kharkiv shellings are chaotic. Usually the residential districts are affected, these are Saltivka, Northern Saltivka, Oleksiivka,"" he said, adding that electrical power was lost in several districts.

Syniehubov said that in the south of the Kharkiv region, the area around Izium — which is held by the Russians — remains the ""hottest"" spot. He said Ukrainian forces were holding their positions.

He said evacuations continued from several towns within range of Russian artillery fire, including Barvinkove, ""as we expect there might be a theater of combat operations there.""

Syniehubov also claimed that a Russian military unit accused of atrocities in the town of Bucha north of Kyiv had now redeployed to Kharkiv region. ""It was partially eliminated nearby Izium. With these people taken captive, we will do everything for them to be punished accordingly, or at least to testify about their commanders who gave orders for such atrocities that took place in Bucha.""

The tribe then sent twenty men to propose she marry their prince. She buried them alive. 

She then sent word that they should send their best and wisest to help plan the coming wedding. She locked them inside the bathhouse and burned them alive. 

She then sent word that she would marry him after hosting memorial feast with mead for her slain husband in the place he was killed. After getting them drunk, her men came in and slaughtered many. 

Then she lay siege to the city where Igor was killed. After a year of stalemate, she said her soldiers would leave if the city paid a tribute of three pigeons and three sparrows from every house. The besieged city happily gave this tribute. Olga then instructed her soldiers to tie a bundle of burning sulfur dangling below the birds leg with a long string. The birds were released, and they all flew back to the city, to their nests in the eaves and roofs, setting the whole city on fire. As people fled they were slaughtered, or captured as slaves. 

A hundred years later, after her vengeance, that tribe had vanished from the history books. Kyiv stands. 

Moral of the story: Don’t mess with Olga’s man.

From CNN’s Anna Chernova

Two regions of Russia that border Ukraine — Kursk and Bryansk — said that their territory has been shelled.

“The morning in the border [town] of Rylsk was restless. At about 8:00am, mortars fired at the checkpoint in the village of Krupets,” the Kursk region Gov. Roman Starovoit said in Telegram post Friday morning local time.

According to Starovoit, “the firing points were suppressed by the return fire of [Russian] border guards and the military.” There were no casualties or destruction, he added.

The head of the Bryansk region, Alexander Bogomaz, said the border department of the Federal Security Service (FSB) had reported shelling in the village of Belaya Berezka, allegedly carried out from Ukrainian territory.

“On April 29, a branch of the border department of the FSB of Russia in the Bryansk region in the village of Belaya Berezka, Trubchevsky district, was subjected to mortar fire from the territory of Ukraine,” Bogomaz said in a Telegram post on his official channel Friday.

Moscow - one of the group's members - vetoed an extension of the mission.



“This is not an easy decision to take... but the position of the Russian Federation left us with no choice but to take steps to close down the Mission,” said the OSCE chairman and Poland's foreign minister Zbigniew Rau.""

*One of the most noted authorities on the F-35 has some interesting things to say about the jet, including how it would fit in with European air forces, and how suitable the fighter is for the air war over Ukraine. Billie Flynn, a former Lockheed Martin test pilot, also talked about how the jet represents a massive leap forward from older, Soviet-designed fighter jets, noting that the pilots who train them would be unable to learn how to fly the F-35. Flynn also believes the F-35 is the only jet that can survive in the lethal air environment over Ukraine.*

At some point, Russia's Eastern campaign will culminate, and they will have to entrench and defend. This will be challenging.

First: Russian forces will remain in continuous contact with Ukrainian forces for the foreseeable future. This will inhibit any effort at building robust fortifications.

Second: Russian control is tenuous, heavily dependent on roads linked to railheads; their control of any given point may be fairly deep, but it's also narrow, and vulnerable to rear area security challenges like insurgent and special forces operations. Part of why the Ukrainian defense has been so effective is because they're fighting on friendly territory, with which they are familiar.  The Russians won't have that. 

Finally: Ukrainian mobilisation is currently primarily focused on reconstitution of exhausted units, but the rate of readiness accelerating over the next 5-7 weeks. That means we're looking at Ukrainian reserves not just being used to reconstitute, but to actually generate entirely new units at the regimental or brigade level. New units that, with the correct combined arms equipment (artillery, tanks, wheeled and tracked IFVs, air power, etc.) could be used in major offensive operations.

Lacking a national mobilization, Russia does not have the necessary troops to counter any new formations. Russia doesn't even have the reserves to reconstitute units currently in the field.

Even if Putin declared national mobilization today, he'd be looking at no fewer than three months to get reserves into the field--and those troops would be ridiculously green, and the one thing that keeps green troops alive--quality NCOs--is something Russia totally lacks.

*Russia’s invasion has come up short for many reasons. Ukrainian heroism and remarkably intelligent and adaptive fighting techniques are major ones.

But none of these factors—alone or together—explain Russia’s stunning failure to achieve its initial objectives. Instead, analysts must consider a problem for Russia that is far more fundamental: its invasion plan itself was shockingly bad.*

From Michael Conte and Barbara Starr

The US believes Russia is attempting to disrupt the Ukrainian military’s ability to “replenish their own stores and to reinforce themselves,” according to a senior US defense official.

The official gave the example of attempted Russian attacks on electrical power facilities, which could hinder Ukrainian trains.

The US also believes that while recent strikes reportedly hit residential areas, they were intended for military production facilities, the official added.

Russian strikes in Odesa are possibly meant to pin down Ukrainian forces there and prevent them from reinforcing defenders in the Donbas region, according to the official.

The official also said that now 1,950 missiles have been launched by Russia against Ukraine since the invasion began in February, and that most of the ordnance being dropped against Mariupol is “dumb” ordnance that is not precision-guided, which suggests Russian forces are still having difficulty replenishing their precision-guided munitions.

Meanwhile, the US has also trained two groups of Ukrainian trainers so far on US artillery outside of Ukraine, according to the official, with the first group being “a little it more than 50” and the second group being “around 50.”

The US has also trained a group of about 15 Ukrainians on the US radar systems that are being provided to Ukraine, with more groups of a yet to be determined number to be trained in the future, the official said.

US training for Ukrainians will “go on for as long as it needs to go on,” the official added.

The US is helping transport some Ukrainians already outside of Ukraine for training and returning them to locations outside of Ukraine so they can reenter Ukraine, according to the official, who stressed that all US transportation of Ukrainian trainers “starts and ends outside of Ukraine.”",False,1651249189.0,t3_ueddzq,t3_ueddzq,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Conditions dire at Mariupol steel mill: Mayor

The mayor of Mariupol says those hiding at a massive steel plant are running out of food, water and medicine.

“Locals who managed to leave Mariupol say it is hell, but when they leave this fortress, they say it is worse,” Vadym Boichenko said, according to a translator. “They are begging to get saved.”

He added: “There, it’s not a matter of days, it’s a matter of hours.”

Boichenko said he hoped a cease-fire would allow those inside the steel mill to safely leave.",False,1651253188.0,t3_ueddzq,t3_ueddzq,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

> the Russian war effort began to unravel, the Ukrainian government maintained hundreds of
> thousands of connections into Russian social media, distributing information about the war to
> swathes of the Russian population.36
> This window of opportunity was short lived. The Russian government moved rapidly to shut
> down independent media,37 threaten a 15-year prison sentence on anyone sharing non-official
> narratives on the conflict,38 and closed access to non-Russian social media.39 The results were
> highly effective. Although people in Russia can access external information sources through the
> use of VPNs, the measures meant that only those who actively searched for information would
> find it. This radically cut the number of people who were accessing non-Russian controlled

> radicalising language was not a nationalistic response to events but was instead directed
> centrally and accompanied by practical, organisational steps to put Russia on a war footing. On
> 24 March, for example, the Governor of Bryansk, Alexander Bogomaz, issued instructions to all
> local authorities declaring that ‘the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, despite significant
> human losses, continue to restore order in Ukraine, repeating the feat of the Heroes of the Great
> Patriotic War’.42 He ordered that local authorities prepare to ‘conduct briefings in educational
> institutions on the procedure for the actions of students, as well as employees in the event of
> artillery shelling or air strikes’ and that local authorities must ‘carry out, together with patriotic

What would be the point? Just territory for territory's sake? Russia has nothing to gain from controlling Moldova and it would be a huge money sink.

The only true benefit would be having another territory to attack Ukraine from - and that is where the evil NATO nazis are, that is who the enemy is, that is who the people want to see defeated.

But why would Russia need all of Moldova for that? They already control exactly the land they need to stage an attack.

So, to me it is absolutely clear  that Transnistria getting involved could take only one form - an attack towards Odesa, or the threat of it.

I don't see how Transnistria could pull it off, and I actually could imagine Ukraine completely taking over their territory and handing it over to Moldova if they wanted to. (Not right now, but with a bit of prep.) 

So when Moldova talks about their lack of military, the way I understand it is that they're simply saying ""Hey Ukraine, we know this sucks and we'll be very appreciative of your sacrifice if it comes to it - we can't stop them from attacking you if that's what they plan. Sorry!""

I don't see why Moldova would be worried about themselves. Or am I missing something?",1651233240.0,1651233136.0,t3_ueddzq,t3_ueddzq,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

He said heavy shelling was also taking place in Avdiivka and in Lyman – where Russian forces are pressing deep from the east to surround the strategically important cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.

In the midst of the fighting, civilians’ evacuation attempts are also taking place, including from the city of Popasna where heavy and close-contact fighting is ongoing. A Ukrainian army source told Al Jazeera that the city is split into two with Kyiv controlling the southern half.

“A lot going on in this area – an indication of just how focused Russian forces are taking more terrain in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” Stratford said.

The fact is that most railroad infrastructure is pretty easy to repair and maintain. There are three things that can close railroads for long periods of time. Flooding and Landslides are one (lumped together because they tend to go hand in hand), especially if the ground remains unstable. An army usually can’t cause flooding (though, admittedly early in the war the Ukrainians did use flooding defensively). The second major thing is tunnel collapses or damage. There are not a lot tunnels in a flat country like Ukraine. The third is losing a large bridge. Bridges are fairly easy to repair or replace if your prepared or they are small.

For example I recall a bridge on Southern Pacific Coast line in the 80s that needed replaced, 100’-150’ steel through truss bridge with probably 100’ of steel deck girder bridges on either side. Southern Pacific had the line closed less than 24 hours to replace five bridge spans and lay new track over the bridge before reopening the line to traffic. 

However the old SP had pulled everything together and had planned that out to the minute, so as not to delay the two daily Amtrak trains that used the line. If you’re not prepared a medium size bridge will close you for a month at minimum with something above a minor problem. If the bridge goes completely while there’s a train on it possibly carrying munitions, you’re going to have a really bad time. Best guess 6-9 months to restore this bridge the Ukrainians blew up yesterday.

China’s ministry of foreign affairs has accused Nato of messing up Europe and stirring up conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region, after the UK’s foreign secretary told China it should “play by the rules”.

In a speech at Mansion House in London on Wednesday, Liz Truss renewed calls to boost Nato in the wake of the Ukraine war. Truss also delivered a direct warning to China. “Countries must play by the rules. And that includes China,” she said.

On Thursday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, dismissed Truss’s comments and accused Nato of demanding other countries abide by basic norms while it has “wantonly waged wars and dropped bombs in sovereign states, killing and displacing innocent civilians”.

“Nato, a military organisation in the North Atlantic, has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region to throw its weight around and stir up conflicts,” Wang said.

https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/can-the-russian-economy-withstand-the-sanctions/

Excerpt:


> this strategy of creating a ‘Russian fortress’ based on monetary and fiscal discipline meant that Russia emerged from the 2014 and 2015 sanctions and counter-sanctions with a more impoverished populace. Savings were imposed to balance the books and to prepare for a crisis such as the current one, at the expense of spending on education, healthcare and social policies, and an initial phase of de-internationalisation that is now gathering pace. This has triggered an approximate 10% fall in the purchasing power of salaries, but it has also meant a realignment of the economy towards self-sufficiency (the development of the domestic dairy industry being a perfect case in point) and increased trade with markets outside Europe, including Latin America, to procure foodstuffs at competitive prices. This has been tough on ordinary Russian citizens, but as Chris Miller points out, throughout these years, with the exception of protests in large cities like Moscow and St Petersburg in 2014 and 2015, the Russian public has not demonstrated en masse against the Kremlin; this has strengthened Putin, who has increased his popularity since the annexation of Crimea and is possibly hoping to do the same now in the lead up to the 2024 election (where he will presumably run again).
> 
> Could this change now with the current sanctions, which are of a much greater order of magnitude? Everything for now suggests not. The research that has been conducted into economic sanctions reveals that their impact tends to diminish if the state on the receiving end is strong, relatively stable in economic and political terms, rejects the international order and is autocratic. North Korea and especially Iran are the paradigmatic cases here, and the fact is that Russia displays many of the same characteristics. Sanctions, moreover, tend to have the perverse consequence of swelling patriotism in opposition to the ‘external enemy’ and are used by the regime as a propaganda weapon to accentuate national antipathy towards the foreign threat. Many have said that this is Putin’s war, but in fact some opinion polls show that the majority of Russians support the invasion and the number seems to have risen since the sanctions were imposed.

The writers mention that Russia is a key exporter of raw materials. Things that everyone takes for granted, like supplies of Palladium, nickel and sapphire. While not mentioned in the research, this explains why Airbus is still buying from Russian materials companies.

Some facts about Ukraine's energy:


> Ukraine relies heavily on imports to meet its petroleum and other liquids demand.
> 
>  In 2020, petroleum and other liquids imports met about 70% of Ukraine’s liquids consumption. The country produced only 74,000 barrels per day (b/d) of petroleum and other liquids.
> 
> Ukraine imports most of its petroleum products from Belarus, Russia, and Germany. Crude oil imports, sourced increasingly from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, supply Ukraine’s sole operating refinery, the Kremenchug facility.
> 
> Ukraine is a transit country for Russia’s crude oil exports, which travel to Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline network, which transports 400,000 b/d.
> In late 2019, Ukraine’s pipeline operator, Ukrtransnafta, extended the contract with Russia’s Transneft to transport crude oil through 2030. In 2020, approximately 244,000 b/d of Russia’s crude oil traveled through Ukraine.

A ) If western intelligence genuinely had confirmation of this, would they announce they knew it was definite, cause mass panic and lose any tactical advantage or use the week or so to quietly warn, prepare for the panic and mobilise as rapidly as possible in the background so that when it does happen we are more prepared to respond than they expect?  

B) Often when there is intelligence suggesting events of these magnitudes we’ve been seeing recently; reports about it “might” happen or “predictions” often come out to soften the population to the idea/news rather than semi surprise them with it.  

C) Could have non-concrete evidence and attempting to warn the Russians that we know what might be coming to try to steer them away

I’m not saying any of that is right but I wouldn’t ignore this statement completely because it also make complete sense in terms of the switch in Russian propaganda recently and the historical significance and importance of the date to Russian people and consciousness.

My sneaking suspicion is that the West denied it to prevent what happened with the MiG’s earlier in the war. But they seem to have coordinated to provide Ukraine equipment to practice combined arms, which will give them an advantage.

The US hasn’t utilized the M113 in combat in a long time as it was ill suited to counterinsurgency operations and the MRAP’s provides better mobility. But it was designed to accompany the M60 main battle tank. The T-64 main battle tank, which is the mainstay of the Ukraine Armed Forces, has a similar top speed to the M60 (T-64 max top speed on road of 60.5 km/h, off road of 35 km/h; M60 max speed of 48 km/h). The M113 has a top speed of 67.8 km/h, which means it can safely accompany the T-64 tanks into battle and won’t be left behind.

We still have long way to go, our weapons industry is big and we must pressure our politicians to send those weapons to Ukraine. The situation here is not good at all, the russian propaganda is very strong here and there are lots of people who are scared that if we send those weapons then Ruzzia will attack us. Also as a post communist country,  unlike countries like Poland and Chezch Republic, we didn’t get rid of the communists and we still have lots of Russian influence in our politics to this day. Our president is a puppet of Putin and states that we should not send weapons in order to keep the peace. Also last year he said that Crimea is Russian. Last year we had parliament elections 3 times because the parties couldn’t make a coalition(121 politicians are needed in the parliament in order to have a ruling coalition, the other 119 are at opposition). So in order to finally have stable parliament after 3 elections, 3 of the parties made a coalition with BSP(Bulgarian Socialist Party) which ruled the communist regime between 1944-1989 as a compromisе. Obviously those guys are puppets of Putin and KGB and their party leader Kornelia Ninova threatened that if we send weapons to Ukraine then BSP will leave the coalition and thus resulting in the collapse of the current parliament and new elections. This, however, is 100% bluff because BSP are constantly losing electoral votes and if they leave now they might not even get to the 4% votes barrier which is needed to get into the parliament. Also communist never lets go of political power just like that. Unfortunately, the other parties in the coalition are just as scared as BSP that in eventual elections they might not get 4 percent of the votes so they are calling the bluff. All in all I hope that our politicians grow balls and do what is right to be done and not think about themselves all the time. Also I really hope that Ukraine and the West can win this war and destabilize this evil country because I am tired of living in a one which is influenced so much by Putin and his oligarchs.",False,1651255917.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6ml61t,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The Ukrainians have done the right thing here. 

They are dug in, and so artillery effects them less. And then they are withdrawing in good order, so that they can inflict maximum damage to the Russians.

They are trading space for enemy troops. 

Exactly the right tactics.

(The Russians are also so poorly trained and with such poor morale that they are STILL sticking to main roads which makes it pretty easy to ambush them, or find them with drones (which you use to then direct artillery on them)).

So we will see the Battle for Donbas culminate in maybe the next 2-4 weeks.

Basically the Russians are gonna run out of troops, and the Ukrainians are going to counterattack.

More widely, there has been a major strategic shift in the war.

UK Foreign Sec Liz Truss has stated that the UK strategic aim is to evict Russian forces from Ukraine (including Crimea, so back to pre-2014 borders). She also said it would take ten years but she’s wrong about that: Russian forces will collapse before that, and we’ll see a coup)

Yep. No way they have 92000 troops on the ground.

Probably closer to 60000-70000.

Remember also that as an ""invading"" force, every time they claim to capture territory they have to leave a significant number of troops in those positions to secure the areas, man checkpoints, defend against counter-attacks, quell the local unrest, commit their standard war crimes (e.g. loot, rape, destroy infrastructure, shit on the floors where they sleep) etc...

The Russians do not have the troop numbers to sustain this.

❗️ Friends, no more news yet.

 📌 Comments are closed for the night as always.

 😔 The situation in the city still does not change, in many areas it is already relatively calm and the hottest spot is still Azovstal.
 Hundreds of civilians and soldiers continue to remain at the plant, including about 600 wounded....
 the hospital is destroyed at the plant and treating the wounded is now a very difficult task.
 Our military continues to protect our Mariupol even in such inhuman conditions.  These are the real HEROES!!!
 We believe in our defenders🙏🏻

 The plant urgently needs evacuation to bring out the wounded and civilians!  We really hope this happens soon.

 The cynicism of the invaders is no longer news to us.  They now want to make a park dedicated to the dead instead of Azovstal.  By the way, those who died at the hands of the occupiers ... want to stomp on the blood of the dead innocent?  Everything is as usual, nothing new.  Boomerang will soon return to everyone who came to our land!

 We continue to work and collect information about our city bit by bit, as much as possible.
 We sincerely thank our subscribers who help us run the channel and share photos and videos.  Thank you all very much ❤️

 😴 Today we are very tired, let's go to rest for a few hours and continue working early in the morning!

They demonstrated to the world that the USA won't hesitate to crush you economically if you push back against them in anyway. 

This has larger ramifications then just the current conflict. When you've placed the idea in leadership minds that assets within the US or EU are no longer safe, or that the petrodollar is not stable, it's going to start a cascade of future diversification for everyone, which can be destabilizing. 

A good example of this is the moves by Israeli central bank to reduce its USD Holdings and add the Yuan for the first time ever. 

While these issues seem unimportant right now in the face of war and acts of heinous brutality from a terrorist state, they do have serious ramifications in the years to come and could lead to instability again within the middle east if some countries like Saudi Arabia begin to push back against the USA dominated world markets.

Even before the Soviet Union existed, Russia held the belief that the Balkans and Ukraine in particular were meant to be part of Russia and were effectively rogue states that needed to be reincorporated. This is why, for the longest time, it was referred to as ""the"" Ukraine, making it sound more like a region rather than independent country.

The collapse of the Soviet Union was seen as a tragedy inside Russia, a loss of those states which had finally been unified and returned to their rightful place as part of Russia.

This is why Putin and Russia referred to this as a ""special operation"" to ""rescue"" Russian citizens. They believe that ""true"" Ukraine citizens wish to be reunited with the motherland and they are being held hostage by the bad guys who want to corrupt them and prevent them from doing so.

The first is the soviet mindset towards politics.  After the Bolshevik revolution, which seized power from aristocracy to give to commoners—no commoners were ever ever ever in power! 

What actually happened was a new crew came in, and there’s been a series of brainwashings, each in order to stifle another revolution.

One of these is that the general population does not know what is best for themselves—the elite,the establishment, knows best.  Ask any Russian their opinion on the decisions discussed made by their political leadership they don’t pay attention or question—they’ve always been told, and thus always believed, that those who already have power, have the best mind, best skills, best experience to make decisions.

Every Russian thinks Putin knows best.  Therefore, when he says “I think” or “I want,” everyone thinks it is the best best best idea because it came from their genius. He’s intentionally saying it bc it makes his statement even stronger, from their point of view.

I feel like a broken record in these reddit threads but it needs repeating so some folks don't stress as much...

Concentrating forces in the South and East by Russia doesn't solve their logistics and supply issues, it makes them worse.

Same same, it doesn't solve their Command, Control and Comms issues either, it makes them worse.

All of the issues above are not solved quickly. They can be improved a little in a short time but to a point; the systemic issues require years to fix.

So as long as Ukraine has ammunition, Russia isn't going anywhere any time soon.

And I mention ammunition because there's been the occasional report that Ukraine needs Artillery ammo, but unsure whether these issues have been solved.

There are two things that are causing frustration and stress now, and don't get me wrong, I'm all for Ukraine, and fuck Russia, but...

1. There is some stress that Russia may invade, but there's no point, we're never mentioned in any of Putin's ""blog posts"", he doesn't show interest in us. 

2. There is also stress that Ukraine and other forces are trying to drag us in, or expand conflict there.

All of the things happening in Transnistria have nothing to do with us, they are false flags made by Russia to blame Ukraine, but probably some legit Ukrainian spec ops as well.

And even Transnistria said so, we agreed that we don't want any of this and shall live in peace. Just yesterday there was a meeting between their ""president"" and one of our officials. Their position is basically ""please ignore all of this, we'll try to stabilize it, nothing against you"" 

We don't need Transnistria, we don't want Transnistria, we don't have the possibility nor the will or need to do anything about them.

At this point we're just two neighbors with okayish relations, just that they're occupied by russians, and we can't recognize them because it would set a precedent, and to be honest they (their government actually) don't even want recognition.

On the other hand, Ukrainians are getting mad at us for not providing them with our 6 MIG aircrafts... Aircrafts that are not functioning for over 20 years already, and should only be used for display in a museum somewhere.
I don't mean the government, I mean the people.

This may sound a bit harsh - but please, let us take care of the refugees, who are already close to 10% of our population, and LEAVE US THE FUCK IN PEACE.

We don't have military capability to defend ourselves, but you want us to liberate Transnistria, help Ukraine, and then what? Conquer the world maybe?

Please, be realistic.

7170dafe3af07ca1ae3bb0bbf7ef3905,ueddzq,i6q8z39,"Bad take.  People here really don't understand the Russian mindset, and that includes the UK defense secretary.  Older folks in Russia are not just supportive of status quo administrations, even dictatorial ones, but also very, *very* anti-war.  And the one is because of the other.  This is not a paradox.  Let's please let that sink in, because in light of this any attempt to equate or coincide the announcement of full-scale conscription to a public holiday is nonsense.  

This is why Putin had to maintain that his invasion was definitely not a war, but some special police action the particulars of which must be hidden from public consumption.  He had to maintain this as long as possible.  The generations that lived during the USSR were willing to trust the status quo, willing to despise the West, but also wanted above all that no war should occur as a result of that.  Long-serving state father figures were and still are, for them, a deterrent against reckless decisions.  Just as a police operation is to them a deterrent against something worse, and therefore that operation is something they will support.  So long as it stays that way.  The second world war was still a living memory; it was not something to gleefully repeat.  Please attend to the you-tubes and view any amount of interviews with Gorbachev where he says precisely this:  that he toured the country on taking power and wherever he went, whoever he spoke with, they would tell him let famine and hardship come for they will make do, but pretty please with extra fuck sauce on top, do not make war on the West.  It influenced his entire foreign policy.  

Those attitudes can also be found in other Eastern Bloc countries.  It is the attitude of the population over 50 in Poland, in Romania, in Czechia.  If anything the fear is greater with Russians, to the extent they will sacrifice personal freedoms and conveniences, live in poverty, sacrifice one of their sons to the general conscription game to be abused and exploited, all to avoid the kind of destability from which war might result.  

Now, one thing is crucially different from that era.  Putin's media serves but is neither written nor closely controlled by him.  He would much rather have a moratorium on discussing Ukraine at all for any reason than have Carlsons and Limbaughs shit their genocidal rhetoric into the airwaves for ratings.  This media is certainly attractive to someone, and those are younger people.  Older viewers alternately tune it out or are horrified by it.  Not enough to act or denounce the government, but it is worrying to them.  War is a slogan for the young.  The old know what that word means.  

So while it is conceivable some audience exists who might be ready for the idea of war as patriotic duty, it is not the one Putin has been catering to *this entire time*, which are the older crowd fearful of change.  

There is no way mobilization will occur as a result of or concurrent with the victory parade.  They may have to resort to it at some point (personally I think they will not; false-flags, loss of the flagship, loss of high-ranking officers, incursions into Russian territory by Ukraine, threats from the West - *none* of this has given them the mandate to do that).  But if they do it'll be 2-4 weeks or more from now after all other options have been exhausted.  They have BTGs being rebuilt they still have to send in, they have attempted illegal conscription of Ukrainians in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and they have a few untapped mercenary groups.  And they still have a 3:1 advantage without all that.  They're going to exhaust all that first, and that'll take time.",False,1651275378.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6q4j4m,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

During the 2019 general election campaign, in the wake of a murder on the Carsic council estate in his constituency, Anderson said that certain ""nuisance"" council tenants were ""making people's lives a complete misery"". He said: ""Let's have [the tenants] in the field, picking potatoes or any other seasonal vegetables, back in the tent, cold shower, lights out, six o'clock, same again the next day.""[9] He was criticised by the Labour Party, who said the idea amounted to ""forced labour camps"".[9]


Anderson was also caught setting up a staged door-knock encounter with a friend whilst being filmed by Channel 4 News reporter Michael Crick. Prior to the staged visit, Anderson told the man he arranged to meet to ""make out you know who I am, that you know I'm the candidate but not that you are a friend"".[10] Anderson justified his actions by stating that he ""had been trying to make sure that somebody was in"", before apologising several weeks later.[11]

Anderson was one of three Conservative Party candidates investigated by the party over claims of antisemitism during the election campaign.[12] The investigation was opened on the grounds that he was an active member of a Facebook group in which other members supported Tommy Robinson and promoted George Soros conspiracy theories.[13][14] Whilst under investigation, he was confronted by the head of the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism over a letter he co-signed, published by the Daily Telegraph, which employed the phrase ""Cultural Marxism"".[15][needs update]

In February 2021, Anderson was criticised by Ashfield District Council leader Jason Zadrozny of the Ashfield Independents, who described Anderson's behaviour as ""consistently disappointing"" and stated that he called for the government to scrap Ashfield's Future High Streets' Fund bid as he was concerned that this would result in the Ashfield Independents receiving praise.[16]

In June 2021 Anderson announced he would not be watching the England national football team at UEFA Euro 2020 games in response to the players taking the knee prior to matches. He said: ""The FA and the England football team have made a big mistake in supporting the taking of the knee before football matches ahead of the European Championships. The FA, Premier League and footballers now run the risk of becoming like the Labour Party and that is having nothing in common with their traditional supporters.""[17] Referring to the association of the taking the knee gesture with the group Black Lives Matter he said: ""For the first time in my life I will not be watching my beloved England team whilst they are supporting a political movement whose core principles aim to undermine our very way of life.""[18]",False,1651263355.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6pf2nd,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

It became conventional wisdom in geopolitical circles a looong time ago that the ultimate fate of the planet was either one country ‘winning’ the game, or if you were in the advanced class that the world would reach an equilibrium with three great powers with the weaker two allied against the strongest until the pecking order changed and the new weakest two would ally against the new strong one, like in 1984. 


Many, many wars, proxy-wars, and various other evils have been perpetrated by leaders pushing miniatures around on a world map in their efforts to win The Great Game, the Grand Chessboard, or whatever we’re calling it these days.


The entire exercise is stupid. It treats nation-states as the only ‘real’ actors in the world, it treats ‘spheres of influence’ as a zero-sum game. In fact, everything in that world-view is zero-sum.

Ziggy was a smart and decent guy, but he was also old and playing the old games. The world isn’t a chess-board. The world is only a strategy game if we’re all playing a strategy game.

If this is the start of mobilization for Russia Ukraine has months to keep 'building up'. Russia cannot equip, arm, and train millions of reservists very quickly at all. In fact, I've read analysis speculating that this will just make all of Russia's logistical issues worse. They already have a hard time feeding and supplying their current forces.

If these forces ever see combat they won't be very effective, either. The vast majority of their reserves are just people who finished their conscription. They're not like the US National Guard who are already equipped and receive regular training. Most conscripts receive very little training, there are accounts from former conscripts that they only went to a rifle range once and fired the minimum number of rounds to get 'qualified' stamped on their records. They also would have terrible morale, even worse than Russian troops do today.

A mobilization can also tank support on the homefront. People will not be happy or motivated to fight, especially since they aren't fighting a defensive war. It remains to be seen if Russia's propaganda and internal security services will continue to muzzle all forms of dissent or if there will be popular protests.

It is likely too late for Russian mobilization to have a decisive effect on this war. If they are ever put on the front lines they won't perform very well, and there will just be a lot more Russian men getting killed. If they wanted victory they needed to attack Ukraine with like 5 times the number of men and vehicles than they did, and not get bogged down.

 >Shrews (family Soricidae) are small mole-like mammals classified in the order Eulipotyphla. True shrews are not to be confused with treeshrews, otter shrews, elephant shrews, West Indies shrews, or marsupial shrews, which belong to different families or orders. Although its external appearance is generally that of a long-nosed mouse, a shrew is not a rodent, as mice are. It is, in fact, a much closer relative of hedgehogs and moles; shrews are related to rodents only in that both belong to the Boreoeutheria magnorder.

I should emphasise that this doesn't justify all the wars abroad, nor most of them but when considered from certain angles and in certain light; some of them become more understandable. This is what we have intelligence agencies for, and why we don't just rely on think-tanks for foreign policy.

In the case of Ukraine, USA has handled the messaging far better and been far more transparent. (Honestly, big kudos to the Biden administration).

 >Operation Keelhaul was a forced repatriation of Russian civilians (non-Soviet citizens) and Soviet citizens to the Soviet Union. While forced repatriation focused on Soviet Armed Forces POWs of Germany and Russian Liberation Army members, it included all Russians under Allied control. Refoulement, the forced repatriation of people in danger of persecution, is a human rights violation and breach of international law. Thus, Operation Keelhaul has been called a war crime, especially in regards to the many civilians forced into Soviet work camps, many of whom had never been Soviet citizens, having fled Russia before the end of the Russian Civil War.

 >The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р, romanized: Holodomor, IPA: [ɦolodoˈmɔr]; derived from морити голодом, moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The Holodomor famine was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. Ukraine was one of the largest grain producing states in the USSR and as a result was hit particularly hard by the famine. Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly.

For example, the UK finished paying for WW2 lend-lease in 2006 (!), 60 years later. It was a 50 year loan at 2% interest. So they didn’t even have to pay (or have any interest) for a decade after the war ended. Time enough to rebuild their economy.

I'm trying to think of what a good movie is for this. This is more of a Midway situation (except on land instead of at sea).

Midway was about USA trying to fight ""defensively"" after most of its Navy was destroyed in a surprise attack by the Japanese. But the USA saw an opportunity to attack the Japanese fleet... with heavy losses (but even heavier losses on the Japanese side).

Despite being outgunned and outmatched, the American forces conducted the Naval Ambush.

---------

A year later, USA builds like 20 battleships and 15 carriers and roflstomps the rest of the Japanese forces. But Midway was important because it was conducted **BEFORE** the new ships arrived, at severe disadvantaged terms. But instead of starting at Hawaii (if USA lost Midway), USA was able to start island hopping much further west / closer to Japan.

Similarly: Ukraine has to conduct operations today, both defensive and counter-offensive, to buy time for the western-weapons to arrive. The long-term seems to be severely in Ukrainian's favor, but these short-term battles are still very important. Ukraine probably can win this in the long term, but holding the line here will keep the long-term battle easier (better to start the push ""further east"" rather than losing ground).",False,1651247630.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6og73g,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Russia plans to attack a town. Once they enter the town through the main road, artillery starts hitting them. They spread, entering several line of sight corridors prepared by Ukraine, who can free fire on the enemy. After many losses, the Russians will slowly manage to advance past these prepared traps, at which point Ukraine will simply pack up, leave, and detonate whatever barriers were left behind. 

Rather than give up the town completely and give the enemy time to rest, a counterattack by another party begins quickly afterwards, the Russians, having just sustained many losses and exhausted, have to go on the defensive straight away.

1. It doesn't matter if regime change is the goal or not, or at least, it shouldn't. That's exactly what the nukes are for, no one can actually touch Putin directly and that's what sets him apart from those other dictators. He should feel somewhat secure at least from foreign pressure and that makes it irrelevant. He's even got major ""allies"" left in China and India. Internal pressure here is what matters. 
2. Sure they can guarantee Crimea for Putin. Who cares what an official said. You'd be trading Crimea in theory for security guarantees for the future of Ukraine. That's worth more then a strategic piece of land by itself, and by all accounts, Zelenskyy was willing to budge on this earlier in the war.
3. There is always a point in channels, that's completely ridiculous. Mobilization MIGHT come next, if Putin actually has the political capital to do it. Many people think he does not due to the extents they have gone to actually hide this war from the public. Regardless of the things you just said, channels are open. The prisoner swaps between Ukraine/Russia and the recent one's between USA/Russia prove this.
4. The only thing left for Putin is not nuclear, that's insanity. They absolutely can take territory and grind this war into a stalemate that stems for a very long time or until a cease fire is negotiated. People in this day and age don't actually realize how long wars can go without major escalations, victories or defeats. The Korean war lasted 3 years and a DMZ was created and a peace treaty never signed. IF Putin is actually pushed out of Donbas, then yes, nuclear might be the go-to option. No one is very optimistic that they will be pushed out of the entire Donbas anytime soon, not even the Ukraine side.
5. Putin has actually shown the opposite, multiple times. He's de-escalated within this very war from trying to sack the entire country, failing, and setting his sights just on the eastern/southern regions publicly. He de-escalated the Georgian war as well, conceding with just minor territory gains.",False,1651291221.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6r1yw6,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Germany is saying that if they go cold turkey on Russian oil/gas right now, they won't have enough ability to provide power/heating for all of their population. As a result, lots of people will suffer (either deaths or other forms of deprivation), and their economy may take a big hit because they'd have to cut off power to factories to send that power to places where people live to keep them alive.

So if Russia wanted to right now, they could shut off the flow of oil/gas and cause all that harm to Germany. The ""only reason they don't"" is because they want the money more. But potentially if they had money flows from other sources (ex: China/India) then to punish Germany for supplying Ukraine, they could do it without as big of an economic hit.

More to the point is that Russia's economy is in a problematic place and getting worse every day, so it's possible things may get so bad that shutting off the flow of oil/gas would not functionally alter their economic situation in any appreciable way, so they may well do it anyway.

The last bit is the point. It had to be quick or not at all.

Ukraine's leadership survived and galvanized an international response. Ukraine has more, not less, equipment available after two months of war.

Ukraine's army kicked up a gear and has had time to build a substantial defense force of lesser trained volunteers, and volunteers is an important part. It means they want to be there, pay attention to training, and work hard.

War crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces have been seen by all Ukrainians, who have time to build resistance plans and whose resolve is steely and firmly anti-Russian. From a ""hearts and minds"" perspective, Russia has failed, catastrophically. The only way they hold land in Ukraine now is by pure force and frankly they don't have enough soldiers to achieve that, by several orders of magnitude.

 >The madman theory is a political theory commonly associated with US President Richard Nixon's foreign policy. Nixon and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations think he was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the United States, fearing an unpredictable American response. Some international relations scholars have been skeptical of madman theory as a strategy for success in bargaining.

Many people live in a Western bubble where everyone gets along and we all sing Kumbaya together. As much as I wish that was the case, that's isn't the reality in Europe when your neighbor is Russia.  The sad painful reality that will probably offend some people is that Russia has been a pain in the ass for hundreds of years, and likely will be for a hundred years more.

Many Westerners are idealists and wish for the world to be a pure, happy place where we all get along. Meanwhile most Slavs outside Russia understand that's not the reality and the only thing Russians understand is strength and coffins on their doorstep. You don't appease them. You don't try to be nice and apologize to them when things don't work out. And you certainly don't turn your other cheek, hoping they see the error of their ways. 

Instead, you fucking punch the bully in the face and than you fucking punch him again when he stands up. THAT is what Russians understand and that is how Ukraine will eventually win this war.

1) Russia has more total revenue on oil then gas

2) typically oil has a higher profit margin then gas. 

3) oil is hard to scale up and down drastically. You can slow pumping but I’d you run out of storage and have to stop you need to basically cap the well which is expensive to undo.

Edit: adding a quote from source

>According to the central bank, Russia's total exports reached $489.8 billion in 2021. Of that, crude oil accounted for $110.2 billion, oil products for $68.7 billion, pipeline natural gas for $54.2 billion and liquefied natural gas $7.6 billion.

178 billion from oil, 61 billion from gas. Again gas also usually has worse margins is my understanding. An embargo on Russian oil will hurt in a few months they’ll be out of storage and trying to figure out how to get supply lines changed to route oil from Europe to other markets.

Also oil is much easier to source from alternatives. Russia is the biggest natural gas exporter and as you can see 90% of it is shipped via pipeline. That likely means most of Europe is getting a huge portion of its natural gas via Russian pipeline. To get off gas you need to build docks that can take liquified natural gas and connect them into your pipeline infrastructure. This will take years. Then you also have to find countries who export gas and have spare capacity in both their ability to ship and produce. USA and Canada produce a lot but also use a lot- they can likely ramp up production some but aren’t exactly close. Then there is China and the Middle East the countries of the Middle East combine to produce about as much as Russia, and I suspect most aren’t well integrated to ship huge quantities to Europe.",1651259833.0,1651259211.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6p8ion,,3,13,0,13,0,0,

'I am an acquisitions officer for an artillery unit in the Russian Army. Since mafia hooligans stole all of our equipment to sell to Kyrgyzstani rebels, we have been looking for a low-cost alternative to the T-80 Main Battle Tank. After successful trials at a facility in Moscow, this so-called ""Badonkadonk"" was approved for use in the Chechen theatre. Initial reports were favorable, but then somebody noticed that the tank lacked a cannon, treads, and armor, and possessed the engine of an electric bicycle. It did, however, have an excellent audio system, but this failed to compensate for its disappointing 100% mortality rate. Recommended only for use against Lithuanians.'

A liter of that would be enough to shower the inside with molten armor. This is what's used to weld two solid railroad tracks together I a few seconds 

It's just rust and aluminum with a small magnesium strip that functions as a starter. 

This would make the armor itself melt into the passenger compartment. The vehicle would become an oven with the top so hot that it would literally cook anyone inside in a matter of minutes. 

If it also had a small conventional explosive that was fused for about 10 seconds after it hits the portion of armor would be so weakened from the temperature that it would offer no protection and become molten bits of shrapnel. 

That all might be overkill but I don't know how thick the armor is.

That relationship is flipped *inside* the body. Radioactive tracers tend to be things that emit gamma rays via some mechanism.  Like carbon 11 or nitrogen 13 etc, which cause gamma rays on positron annihilation, and as those are least likely to be absorbed, are most useful for detection. 

Alpha sources are the *most* dangerous to ingest.  If a piece of paper will stop an alpha particle, it means your body won't be seeing *any* even make it to your skin from the inside, let alone out. All of that energy will be absorbed by your soft tissue.

Even comparing pre-war quality of life, Ukraine was making faster progress than, for example, Syria. There's a substantial portion of the country intact, the government is favoured by most and hasn't fallen, and the economy continues to operate.

Whilst I don't doubt that there are racist aspects to the way refugees get treated, there are fundamental differences here:

1. Ukrainian refugees are predominantly in immediate neighbour countries, within the same economic bloc. They're trying to travel the minimum distance, not reach some faraway target country.

2. Ukrainian refugees are predominantly children and mothers. Men and childless women are voluntarily going back to fight if they didn't already stay.

3. Ukrainian refugees generally intend to stay only as long as they need to, with both the intention and capacity to return home when possible.

Actually, I think the thing we're missing is because we're using the wrong name.

We should really be calling them Ukrainian Evacuees not Ukrainian Refugees.

They're not permanently fleeing their home in search of a new and better life elsewhere for good. They're seeking temporary shelter from the frontlines of war. Their intention is to return, and they will be welcomed by their country when they do. They aren't being persecuted by their regime and it's an invasion not a civil war.

Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut refused to become the 60th vote needed to break a GOP filibuster unless Democratic leaders eliminated a provision to allow some people younger than 65 to opt in to Medicare rather than buy private health coverage.

January 2010 — Scott Brown Upsets Democrats’ Strategy
Brown, a Republican, unexpectedly won the seat left empty by the 2009 death of Sen. Edward Kennedy, depriving Senate Democrats of 60 votes, the number needed to force a vote on the bill. Backers of the bill moved to a complicated Plan B. That involved requiring the House to pass the Senate bill without any changes. Compromises were worked out through the budget reconciliation process that enabled Senate passage with only 51 votes.

Senators on a rare bipartisan 8–15 vote turned down the idea of including a government-sponsored plan in the health overhaul bill, with Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., leading the majority in what could be a turning point in the push to finish the committee's work.

Section title: Mobilizing For An Ideological Struggle.

One of the most curious aspects of the Russian ‘special operation’ in Ukraine was how little effort the Kremlin had put into preparing its own population for what was about to be undertaken. The justification for the operation was made suddenly, over the course of about 10 days. In this it resembled the annexation of Crimea, despite being a much greater endeavour, suggesting that the Russian government wished to present it to the Russian public as a fait accompli. The lack of preparation of the information environment seemed encouraging for the Ukrainians. Protests began in Moscow, St Petersburg and further afield.35 In the first two weeks of the conflict, as the Russian war effort began to unravel, the Ukrainian government maintained hundreds of thousands of connections into Russian social media, distributing information about the war to swathes of the Russian population.36 This window of opportunity was short lived. The Russian government moved rapidly to shut down independent media,37 threaten a 15-year prison sentence on anyone sharing non-official narratives on the conflict,38 and closed access to non-Russian social media.39 The results were highly effective. Although people in Russia can access external information sources through the use of VPNs, the measures meant that only those who actively searched for information would find it. This radically cut the number of people who were accessing non-Russian controlled media and also reduced the number of people who needed to be monitored by the FSB. Given close monitoring and the threat of imprisonment, these measures also reduced the internal circulation of information to circles of trust between likeminded individuals.40

...

Having secured the information environment, the Russian government faced a decision point. It had not yet clearly articulated a case for war. Indeed, public discussion of war was prohibited. It could reduce the scale of its ambition and thereby prepare the population to accept de-escalation. Instead, the decision was made to not only continue with the narrative of a struggle against Nazism in Ukraine, but to expand the scope of ambition to one of systems confrontation. Examining internal Russian government documents from mid-March shows that the decision to ideologically mobilise the Russian public for war with the use of increasingly radicalising language was not a nationalistic response to events but was instead directed centrally and accompanied by practical, organisational steps to put Russia on a war footing. On 24 March, for example, the Governor of Bryansk, Alexander Bogomaz, issued instructions to all local authorities declaring that ‘the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, despite significant human losses, continue to restore order in Ukraine, repeating the feat of the Heroes of the Great Patriotic War’.42 He ordered that local authorities prepare to ‘conduct briefings in educational institutions on the procedure for the actions of students, as well as employees in the event of artillery shelling or air strikes’ and that local authorities must ‘carry out, together with patriotic organizations, preparatory work on the formation of public local defense detachments’.43 Businesses were also instructed to prepare anti-tank defences, along with a range of additional measures. Most importantly, officials were to report back on the measures they were taking and would be held accountable for implementation. There was, at the time, no threat of Ukrainian incursions into Russia. These orders therefore show how the sense of a territorial threat to the country was being cultivated to justify the war. The direct comparison between a war in Ukraine and the Great Patriotic War in internal official instructions is important because it preceded a transition in the message pervading Russian media and public official announcements, from presenting the war in Ukraine as a limited struggle for Donbas to a systemic struggle with NATO in which Ukraine was merely the military battlefield. This transition in rhetoric ironically developed just as the actual objectives of the Russian military on the ground were curtailed. On 3 April, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon at the Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces in which he said that: ‘We have broken the back of fascism once; we will do it again’.44”",False,1651275935.0,t3_ueddzq,t1_i6q2ail,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Right, exactly. We're treating the same type of person, who needs the same amount of help, who has gone through the same sort of suffering differently simply because of our preferences. Sure, that behaviour is driven by human nature, but we can also see that it's unethical or as you say, unfair. 

But let's accept this inequity for what it for a moment and return to the original point of a ""business class refugee"" supposedly being a wrong term. My point is that it's actually a very apt term because it accurately describes the disparity of treatments between the two types of refugees. So if it's ""not fair"", then why can't we use a poignant term such as ""business class refugee"" to highlight that? 

Again, it doesn't say anything about the refugee, or their experiences, it speaks only to the external surroundings and our treatment of the two. I suspect the reason people don't like to hear it, is because it highlights your exact thinking: self-validated unethical behaviour.

3.5/5 million barrels were going to Europe. That seems to account for nearly 70% of their oil exports.

A higher percentage of gas goes to Europe and it’s almost all by pipeline so it’s probably harder for Russia to sell it elsewhere then crude but crude to Europe is still a bigger income source by a lot. I didn’t want to google too long but looks like between 80-85% of their gas goes to Europe.

Yes I agree other countries can potentially make up a lot of the difference but I think you’ll find a European ban on Russian oil does hurt then. It also may put additional pressure on other nations. With Japan, Australia, North America and Europe out of the market it’ll be interesting.

I do concur a quick look appears to list only ~8% of oil to Europe being by pipeline so they can transport it by ship.

They pushed into Liman, through the Ukrainian front line, and cutting off what were probably the last of the Ukraine forces’ mobile reserves south of Izyum. That is not small by any means. Hell, they’re even making such fast advances that many corpses of Ukrainian forces are just literally being found still within their freshly dug trenches—how do you even manage to deal heavy casualties to the enemy in such a state, from the Ukrainians’ perspective?
