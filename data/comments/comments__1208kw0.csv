Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 March 2023.  


* As of mid-March 2023, Russia had likely redeployed at least 1,000 troops who had been training at the Obuz-Lesnovsky training ground in south-western Belarus.  

* Although no new rotation of troops has been noted, Russia has highly likely left the tented camp in place, suggesting it is considering continuing the training programme.  

* The fact Russia has resorted to training its personnel under the much less-experienced Belarusian army highlights how Russia’s ‘special military operation’ has severely dislocated the Russian military’s training system – instructors have largely been deployed in Ukraine.  

* Russia likely also views Belarus’s continued indirect support to the operation as important political messaging.

Several sources I’ve read lately have said to expect it to be April-May, with one noting that even that leaked expectation *could* be intentional misinformation, to maintain surprise.

Here’s what Volya Media said:

> From what we know from both sides, the Ukraine may go on the offensive between late April and mid-May. The Russian military is expecting a strike in mid-April or earlier. But by that date, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will not have time to receive the equipment that is promised to Ukraine. 

> We believe that the active offensive operations of the Ukrainian army will begin no earlier than the beginning of May. With a high degree of probability, this will be a series of strikes in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, as well as in the Mariupol direction. If this stage is successful—and the RF Armed Forces are blocked in the Crimea—strikes are also possible in the Lugansk and Donetsk directions. More like Lugansk. Everything will depend on the speed of advance, losses, weather and how the Russian army will react to the offensive. If the RF Armed Forces lose control over command and control, as they did last fall, then the Ukrainian offensive could also affect Crimea and the LDNR. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to provide fire support, air cover (and complete control in the sky), and also have a large number of fast and well-armed vehicles. 

> If the Russian forces find themselves locked in Crimea, this will be tantamount to the imminent loss of Crimea, because Russia will not be able to support a large group on the peninsula for a long time. Russia will have to spend the resources of the fleet and aviation on the supply of supplies, and the territory of Crimea will be under constant shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

He stated that in Russia for 12 years there has been neither significant economic growth nor an increase in the income of the main groups of the population. “We live on oil and gas rents,” writes Deripaska.

With the fact that gas is record-low and there is no NordStream, the Chinese buy it at cost. Oil, on the other hand, must now be sold below the cost of production.

There is one target that if Ukraine takes it, it will make 60% of the Ukrainian land currently occupied by Russia suddenly become untenable, or at the very least, highly vulnerable.

Melitopol.

If Ukraine can successfully push south from Orikhiv, possibly bypass or surround Tokmak, and then take Melitopol, everything Russia has south of Donetsk becomes untenable for a heavily railway reliant Russia.

Kherson will become a logistical nightmare for Russia. The forces at Enerdohar npp will be untenable.

Crimea will start looking like a death trap. If I was a Russian, I would not want to be on the wrong side of the Kerch bridge.

Mariupol will also be very logistically difficult for Russia to hold.

Pushing 70km south through Russian territory will not be easy, but if Ukraine really has set up a large offensive force, and it can leverage its assets in the area, it would be an achievable goal.

If Ukraine can do that one 70km push, and secure Melitopol, the writing will be on the wall for Russia, and I believe Russia’s propaganda apparatus will start to break down. It’s very possible this attack will be all Ukraine will need to do. I don’t see Russia’s politics coping with this level of defeat very well.

I don't think I've seen any footage whatsoever that includes their usage, or even just pictures of troops with them. I haven't read any accounts of their use either. 

Considering the amount of drones in use, and with more static style combat, these drones never seemed to have much impact. I mean, a drone sighting for artillery is cheaper even a low cost drone like the 300 in an anti-personnel capacity, which is all it can do. Indeed, improvised drop drones can be used in much the same way but are both reusable and cheaper.

It seems like this drone (less so the 600 variant perhaps) is just  a little obsolete, which is why the US was fine dumping them all, and especially so in this sort of combat.",False,1679669494.0,t3_1208kw0,t3_1208kw0,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

UA is already making some probing attacks in the areas of Orikhiv and Polohy. It's possible these are just feints, but I don't believe a very high level of subterfuge is necessary or would even be very effective. Russia also has satellite intel and recon drones and will know where Ukraine is massing, just like with Kharkiv: They just won't be able to do anything about it.

An attack into Northern Luhansk might gain a lot of territory, but it wouldn't be strategically important. Trying to punch them in the nose at Bakhmut or Donetsk City where they are strongest seems an unnecessary risk given they're on home turf and time/momentum is on their side. (Relatively speaking) A push from Nova Kakhovka is possible, but unlikely due to the river being so difficult to cross: It's too wide for pontoons or quick-deploy bridges, and they would be sitting ducks for artillery crossing the bridge, or risk Russia destroying the dam (the bridge runs over the dam). Kherson is too far west for a meaningful bisection of Russian forces and once again a bridge that could be destroyed or make them sitting ducks for artillery.

Which comes back to IMHO the logical conclusion: A dual pronged attack thru Orikhiv and Polohy, either converging on Tokmak and heading south along the eastern flank of Melitopol to the coast and the inlet there. Or possibly maintain the dual prong and send the Polohy contingent to siege Berdyansk.

That would allow them to theoretically be in striking range of the Kerch bridge, which will need to be rendered unusable for ground transport if they want to effectively put the squeeze on Crimea and the western Russian forces.",False,1679635427.0,t3_1208kw0,t3_1208kw0,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

“What do you call a country:

Which violates the airspace and territorial waters of another country without prior provocation?

Who exercises in the exclusive economic zone of another country?

Who is buying Russian military equipment in violation of US law?

Which has more lawyers and journalists in jail than almost any other country and jails its main political opponent before an election?

Which seeks by force to block the rights of an EU member state to research on its continental shelf?

Which has not only joined the EU sanctions. against Russia, but has exported about $800 million worth of goods to Russia?

Continuing airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, including against US partners such as the Syrian Democratic Forces?

Which stops the critical enlargement of NATO?

Which continues to occupy an EU country. with 40,000 troops and in violation of UN Security Council resolutions and seeks to open an area frozen by the United Nations?

Who denies religious freedom to the religious leader of millions of citizens of the Greek Orthodox faith?

Who has turned a church into a mosque in violation of UNESCO commitments?

Where are arrests and imprisons of US personnel?”

There are 1st person videos of the interface, as well as observation drones watching them be used, footage of them being launched. There was a video not long ago of speculated switchblade 600 use against RU AA vehicles in the Kherson region.

Switchblades are not obsolete, but are misunderstood, or at least on reddit were elevated on a pedestal as some sort of wonder weapon.

A switchblade 300 is a flying HE/frag grenade, yes you can drop a frag from a drone and potentially reuse it again, but the advantage of the 300 comes from aspects like range and its operating/targeting system - you don't need an operator to fly it constantly (run the risk of operator being located), more direct it onto a target which it can seek itself. It is ideally used for special ops/assassination missions but also does a perfectly good job striking Russian positions - search & destroy (go after the mortar/artillery crews) etc.

600 is similar, but amped up explosives so it can strike tanks/armoured vehicles. However even then you need to consider that not many 600s existed when they were first introduced to Ukraine, who also have a plethora of other anti tank weapons (mines, artillery, shit they have a bunch of brimstones as well) and have no trouble killing RU armour, in fact that job is going to get easier for them as RU activates older and older tanks.

The problem with this reasoning, is that Ukraine has a much stronger benefit of avoiding such strategies, through support from the west.

Which also opposes the rethoric of how western arms risk the usage of nuclear weapons. If Ukraine is not given the benefits of western arms with conditions of use, they will have to turn to more traditional forms of war, and exchange of land is an option in that case. And if Ukraine was unrealistically successful and reached the Kremlin, nukes would be more viable than if they went into Crimea.

It would be a huge blunder to invade Russia. You have to remember that most people are in essence ""low information voters"". They do not know the issues, intricacies or details of the war. They know that Russia invaded, they know about Russian war crimes and that generally speaking Ukraine is the ""victim"" that is heroically and unexpectedly fighting back. Western politicians know damn well that continued support to Ukraine is key for the security in Europe, and that they have a unique opportunity here to re-establish European Unity, NATO-unity and deal a major strategic blow to an authoritarian and hostile regime on EU's border. But their actions are limited by the popular support they receive. So as long as the general populace believes the Ukraine=victim narrative, they can continue to support Ukraine.

If Ukraine were to attack into Russia however, then that simple narrative would become a lot less valid. A huge influence campaign would be set up that would hammer the narrative: ""Ukraine is the aggressor"". Any attack of Ukraine into Russia would very likely yield civilian casualties, and those would be plastered all over the news and social media, amplified by fake news and pictures about Ukranian war crimes. Russia has been saying from the start that they were ""forced"" into this situation by Ukrainian actions, and that they are now ""proven right"" in a sort of ""mask off"" moment for Ukraine. Low information voters who by nature could be anti-government or distrustful of authority, would be easily swayed and come to believe that this is a ""both sides"" situation, reducing support for Ukraine around NATO countries.

Geopolitically speaking, we'd see something similar. China could for instance use an invasion of Ukraine into Russia as pretext to increase their support for Russia. Any weapon deliveries could be done under the guide of ""helping Russia defend itself"", rather than aiding a Russian war of aggression. UN votes that now consistently go against Russia, could see an uptick in Russian support - especially as Russian disinformation in non-NATO countries and inherent distrust towards previous colonial powers / western nations makes support for Russia in non-NATO countries higher by default.

For Russia itself it would be a huge opportunity to drum up domestic support. As much as people in these threads like to say ""All Russians"", fact is that actual support for the war is pretty low and most Russians are cooperating out of fear and helplessness, rather than any sort of enthusiasm. Invading Russia proper would give a huge PR boost to the Putin regime and would turn a lot of apathetic Russians into pro-war Russians. Fact is, the Putin regime under the current circumstances has an expiration date. Nobody knows when that date is, but every day Russian men die and the Russian economy suffers without having anything to show for it. Invading Russia would create a ""rally around the flag"" effect that would give the Putin regime another boost to continue the war. 

The reverse would be true for the Zelenskyy government. It's one thing to send Ukranian men off to die in the defense of your country, it's another to go and occupy territory that doesn't belong to you. This war has put huge strain on the Ukrainian society, but they bear it because they are defending themselves. Invading Russia would threaten Ukranian unity. We already saw some cracks appear when the military and government decided to hold Bakhmut, which shows that there are definite limits to what the government can get away with.

Lastly, it would certainly be an escalation of the conflict, which nobody wants. While NATO support for Ukraine is strong, the priority of NATO has been from the beginning to prevent this conflict from spilling over into a general war. Staying within the confines of the current rules of engagement is in the interest of NATO and they would absolutely not support any change in that. For a while it seems that Russia was toying with the idea of using a small tactical nuke in Ukraine to break their resistance, but with large international condemnation including from key allies such as China and India and outright threats of war from the US, they were dissuaded from the idea. An attack into Russia could be just the push they need to ""demonstrate Russian might"" and employ a tactical nuke on an advancing Ukrainian army. While it would of course still garner huge outrage, it's much more difficult to argue against the defensive use of nuclear weapons than the offensive use. Think of it from the perspective from the US government: do you go to war with Russia when they use a nuke defensively? Would your population support that? Probably not. The US sees itself as the defender of a rule-based international order and it's public likes to think of themselves as ""the good guys"". Well, do the ""good guys"" risk global war because the ""bad guys"" defended themselves with a nuke? Very probably not.

All in all, there is no scenario in which invading Russia proper is good for Ukraine. It would embolden Russia, change the rules of the game, escalate the conflict, cast Ukraine as the aggressor, depress domestic support in NATO countries for Ukraine, threaten Ukrainian national unity, boost the Putin regime and provide cover for allies of Russia to increase their level of support.

I hate to say it because it sounds ugly, but taking over Crimea militarily might actually be the most politically expedient option. Civilians will flee the area. Whoever remains gets to choose if they want to be Russian or Ukrainian. Crimea will never be a Republic ever again. Those who fled Crimea in 2014 will hopefully return and resettle.

Even at face value assuming he actually measured 10x the number of shells there are reasons for doubt.  A 1000 km front could decrease 10% of their shells and load all the spare into one 10 km section.  A single observer really does see a 10x increase even though there is no change overall

Same thing with a 10% increase in aid shells if they all go to one place.  Likewise with timing.  

I remember working with a Russian a few decades ago.  He told me ""we have a saying in Russia 'measure 10 times cut once'"".   I nodded and said ""we have the same saying here measure twice cut once"".   I have wondered if that is the actual Russian saying or if it was just him switching it from 2x to 10x.

A key difference is the recharging.  A war or battlefield where the power grid still works will give an advantage to rechargeable/reusable drones.  Widespread adoption of electric vehicles might bypass that problem but that might as well be science fiction.  

There are questions about whether drones can be jambed or intercepted by other drones.  The homemade drones might temporarily look devastating simply because the countermeasures were not implemented.  For all i know their might be countermeasures against the Switchblade communications.  

Kamikaze drones should be able to go to the last GPS coordinates entered before losing contact.  Switchblades can have their full fly planned before launch.

They are new to the country, so they'll believe it as they don't know.  So they vote republican without realizing that while democrats are not socialists, republicans are indeed authoritarian. 

2nd is that as they are told that their issues are 100% due to socialism they are more eager to elect authoritarians as they are promising to own the ""libs""/""socialists"".  You'll hear alot on the radio about how Biden is going to turn the U.S. into Cuba or Venezuela.

3rd I don't know the full details about why Cuban in Florida tilt so far to the republicans.  I know there are a lot of factors here like the way they were treated by some democrats and the bay of pigs incident among others.  The point is that Cubans have a stranglehold on spanish media in Florida, specially radio stations.  So any new latino that comes into Florida find themselves with a ready propaganda machine rolling on all cylinders.

Suppose you're a collapsing superpower with enormous military inventory left over from your greater days, but you have nowhere near enough money for the upkeep on it all. A nuclear deterrent is expensive, but it's surely the cheapest way to guarantee your national security against foreign attack, far cheaper than maintaining a conventional army capable of standing up to a great power. If you have a nuclear capability then you can afford to let the tanks rust, if there's a shortage of funding; you're still safe, nobody can attack you anyway. So you'd think the Russians would prioritise this above all else - in which case, although their army is a shambles, their strategic rocket forces might still be apocalyptically powerful.

But then again. The nuclear deterrent sits in deep concrete silos, and in submarines under the ocean, and never actually _does_ anything publicly visible. Its function is to _deter_ rather than actually to be fired; as long as the world still _thinks_ it's there, then it's fulfilling that function just as well as ever. In which case you can let the rockets rust, and spend your resources on maintaining the tanks that actually have to come out and fight from time to time.

And to be clear, I'm not of a mind to criticize Ukraine for using whatever tactics it needs to pressure its neighbors for more aid. But I will criticize a lot of the dumb redditors who parroted it without much of the context. Ukraine has criticized the US dozens of times too... and they've also held publicity stunts celebrating the US and some of its big-ticket aid (ie the HIMARS). Politics is theater, a lot of the time.

Overall, Germany has been Ukraine's 2nd largest supplier, after the US. And like with the US, its a pretty big gap with those further down the list. That does reflect the scale of these countries, of course, but it's worth stating. 

And without getting too deep into details (I don't feel like doing a breakdown of week-by-week aid for something this deep in the comments), the article itself mentions (later) that this is a response to Ukraine posting a need (overall) for 100K helmets. I'm going to assume, more generously, that Germany was trying to help meet that request of non-lethal aid to the best of its ability, but I'm also going to assume didn't just have 100K helmets sitting around on the shelf, ready to go (To date, its delivered 28K helmets). Aid often works like that, in lots and tranches that can be quite arbitrary in size and based on what is available on short notice vs. what can be delivered over time.

This was also pre-war aid. Again, without getting into the weeds, aid was hardly flowing freely in this time period when many countries were still firm in the belief that the war wouldn't happen, and were thus interacting on the basis of Russia as an influential world power and not Russia as a pariah state that had excused itself from the international system. It is also one of those things about Democracy: it moves slowly, because it's built in a lot of bureaucracy and checks on unitary power. Putin can say 'go drag 100k people off the streets, put guns in their hands and send them to Ukraine' and it... actually happens, within impressively short timeframes, as we've seen.

Former FSB director and current head of the Security Council, and one of Putin's closest advisors and confidants. 

If he could still muster the loyalty of the FSB (i.e. gets Bortnikov and other high level officials on board), there is not really anyone or any group in Russia who could challenge him if Putin is out of the picture. The military is not really in much shape to carry off a coup. The national guard, being full of Putin worshipers, may put up some resistance but I suspect the FSB would be able to retire Putin quietly, and if he's already dead, there's not really much reason for his old loyalists to fight.
