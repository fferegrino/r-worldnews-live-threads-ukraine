Therefore, it is important for us to knock out more of them before the start of an active operation here,” says an officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 

> Russian sources also confirm the problem with artillery tractors. Due to their shortage in the early days of the Ukrainian offensive, Russian batteries and divisions could not quickly change exposed positions and were destroyed by counter-battery fire from the Ukrainian army or raids. Therefore, they tried to move the towed artillery away from the front line so that it would not be completely knocked out. Instead, now, self-propelled guns and *Nonas* are used, which are more numerous on the southern front than in the east.

Many parents refused to evacuate their children from Bakhmut.  (The Rada has since changed the law on the removal of children from the front...) 

One was this 12yo boy—he was not evacuated by his father—and suffered severely.  First, he *already* has burns over large portions of his body from earlier in life, in 2014, when they were in Gorlivka and the Russians attacked.  Three months ago, he and his father were near where an artillery shell landed in Bakhmut.  His father—his only parent—was killed.  The boy was taken for emergency surgeries.  He had shrapnel next to his heart, in neck, and in head. 

If that doesn’t seem bad enough: shapnel cut off blood supplies, a d the 12yo then had a heart attack and a stroke.  Making him to talk or walk. 

He’s had surgeries and is relearning to walk and speak.  It’s quite tragic.  He has a little brother, uninjured, and still has his grandmother.  After all these latest wounds are addressed, he may have treatments on his old burns, but such treatments not performed in Ukraine.

It’s tragic that children are in war zones.  Parents defiantly hide the children, say that none are there. Just yesterday, I read that hidden children were discovered in Avdiivka.

>
>*Ukrainian captives released in prisoner exchanges say that beatings were common, and that they suffered from woefully inadequate health care and food.*
>
>Shot through the jaw and tongue by a sniper’s bullet last year in the last days of the grinding siege at the Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine, Senior Sgt. Maksym Kushnir could not eat or talk, and could barely breathe.
>
>But when he hobbled out of a bunker last May with hundreds of other wounded Ukrainian soldiers in a surrender negotiated with Russian forces, there was no medical help or any sign of the Red Cross workers they had been promised.
>
>Instead, Sergeant Kushnir, nine years a soldier and a poet since childhood, said he was taken on a two-day bus journey into Russian-controlled territory and left on a bed to die, with his jaw shattered and gangrene spreading across his tongue.
>
>“I thought it was the end,” he said. “For the first three to four days, they did not do anything. They expected me to die on my own.”
>
>That Sergeant Kushnir survived and returned home to tell the tale is one of the success stories of the war. Even as the two sides are locked in full-scale conflict, Ukrainian and Russian officials have been exchanging hundreds of prisoners of war almost weekly.
>
>Yet the prisoner exchanges have also revealed a grim reality. Ukrainian soldiers have come home with tales of appalling suffering in Russian captivity — executions and deaths, beatings and electric shocks, a lack of health care and near-starvation rations.
>
>Ukraine allows the International Committee of the Red Cross access to the Russian prisoners of war it is holding, an indication that it is meeting its obligations under international conventions of war. Russia does not. It restricts outside monitoring and has confirmed the identities of only some of those it is holding.
>
>Ukrainian officials and former prisoners say Ukrainian captives were in a visibly worse state than the Russian prisoners at exchanges.
>
>…
>
>Former prisoners and human rights groups say Ukrainian captives, including the wounded and pregnant female soldiers, have been subjected to relentless beatings.
>
>Dr. Mkrtchyan described how new arrivals had to run a gantlet of prison guards who beat them with sticks, a hazing ritual known as a “reception.” He recalled running, head down, through the torrent of blows, and seeing a fellow prisoner on the ground. The soldier, a wounded prisoner with serious burns named Casper, was killed by the beating, he said.
>
>…
>
>The men were taken for interrogation to a filtration camp in a disused factory, where their commander was beaten within earshot of the whole unit. The Russian network of filtration camps, where military and civilian Ukrainians are screened and interrogated, have been widely criticized for violations of human rights.
After a few days, Mr. Kolesnikov and his fellow detainees were moved to a Russian prison in the Bryansk region, near the Ukraine border.
>
>The “reception” beating lasted five hours. “I was kneed in the face,” he said. The beatings continued daily for a month. The guards used rubber truncheons, plastic piping, wooden rulers and knotted pieces of rope, or just kicked prisoners, he said.
>
>Prisoners nicknamed one group of guards “the electricians” because they tormented prisoners with electric shocks.
>
>…
>
>Major Andriushchenko was in a penal colony at Olenivka in July when an explosion ripped through a barracks, killing at least 50 Azov members. Like several former inmates of Olenivka who were interviewed, he accused Russia of orchestrating the explosion.
>
>The prison guards closed the gates to the barracks, preventing survivors from escaping, Major Andriushchenko said.
>
>Dr. Mkrtchyan, who was in the same penal colony, said he and other Ukrainian medics urged the guards to let them help the wounded, but they were not allowed to approach them until an hour after the explosion.
>
>…
>
>With his broken jaw and gangrenous tongue, Sergeant Kushnir could not lie down and sat with his head in his arms for several days without painkillers or antibiotics.
>
>Eventually, he was moved to another hospital where doctors amputated his tongue and wired his jaw closed.
>
>He dreamed of eating. He wrote some verse:
>
>*“Have mercy on me, fate. I’m alive.*
>
>*Don’t punish me mercilessly.”*
>
>The physical pain was not as hard to bear as the uncertainty of being a captive, he said.
>
>“When you don’t know what to prepare for, what the next day will bring,” he said, “especially after seeing what the Russians were doing to our men, and being in constant expectation of death, it is not a cool feeling at all.”
>
>At the end of June, Sergeant Kushnir and other wounded men from Azovstal were loaded onto buses and driven to the front line to be exchanged.
>
>Back in Ukraine, he has been through multiple operations and spent months learning to talk again by exercising the scar tissue at the back of his throat.

The tool is able to recognise what fires and heat maps are most likely war related and not just incedental fires that we would see throughout the year. Which allows them to see where artillery preparation, ammo dump explosions etc are taking place which usually is the prelude to a ground assault, shaping or big missile hits/target hits.

To simplify perhaps too much, when Grant was in control, he engaged the Confederates offensively at all points--Sherman in the South, Thomas in Tennessee, Sheridan in the Shenendoah Valley and himself and the Army of the Potomac in Northern Virginia against Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia.  In addition, he attacked continuously, not giving the South the ability to rearrange troops and restock. This was a slow an inexorable process, until finally the Confederate Army broke at multiple points--Thomas destroyed the Confederate Army of the Tennessee, Sherman marched to Atlanta, and Grant outmaneuvered Lee eventually cutting Lee's supply lines.

This was slow, very slow, then (relatively) suddenly all at once. (Best case scenario, obviously).

I hope the Ukraine effort results in a penetration of the Russian defense and eventually a rather quick rollup in a large area of the Russian defense (like Kharkiv), but this is likely to be a slow process before even if this occurs, with incremental progress and achievements.  I'm dubious it will happen quickly and all be over, but I do think Ukraine is showing great patience and husbanding resources wisely, which should pay off, in the end.

I realize modern warfare is different than the Civil War, although Grant probably was the first general to realize the strategy of modern war (versus Napoleonic War). Also that what I posted has been written differently and probably better than this. Part of this was triggered by reading about comparisons to the Normandy invasion.

Honestly I think the West should open a post WWII style amnesty and resettlement program to Russian troops. Because Russia is conscripting people, it's not necessarily their choice to be involved in this conflict. 

If a soldier was conscripted and surrendered at the first available opportunity, perhaps they too are a victim of Putin's and should be treated accordingly. Obviously there needs to be a system to review each POW, but if it can be verified that they were conscripted (did not volunteer), have no criminal record in Russia (aside from political crimes), surrendered as soon as was practical, and were not involved in any war crimes, then I don't see why we shouldn't offer amnesty and asylum to any Russian soldier who wants no further part in this war. 

The West did the same with many German POWs after WWII. One of my cousin's grandpa was a German conscript granted residency and eventually citizenship in the US after being brought here as a POW. Perhaps the West should assist Urkaine by taking custody of some POWs and perhaps some of them should be eventually granted residency outside of Russia if their backgrounds check out.",False,1687266247.0,t3_14e0cbv,t1_josrrg1,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

With ground forces unable to directly mark targets, the troops can only suggest a general location of what they would like hit.    Then it's up to the helicopters to go to the spot, expose themselves as they designate the targets, and launch the appropriate weapons.   With having to visually acquire targets, this opens up extended periods of vulnerability which only increases as they loiter in the area of operations.  

It does need to be said, however, that If there's one thing that has benefitted the Russian helicopter force, it's the Ukrainian switch from lighter infantry-heavy units to more mobile vehicle-heavy formations for maneuver operations.    Early in the war, it was more challenging for the helicopters, since a majority of their standoff-ranged weaponry was anti-vehicle.   This only left cannons and rockets, which meant they either had to come in close to the infantry and shoot (putting them in MANPADS range) or do those ballistic rocket-arcing popup attacks we saw both sides doing early in the war.   Once the helicopters started getting hit hard due to the density of Ukrainian MANPADS coverage, the Russian helicopters backed away from direct infantry support.

With more armored vehicles in play, the helicopters can use the standoff munitions, allowing them to remain out of the reach of Ukrainian MANPADS while hitting targets.   In addition, the mobile forces also have to advance without the cover of MANPADS, which have to be deployed ahead of the mobile forces to interdict Russian aviation as they come into the fight - hard to do when you're moving whole kilometers at a time.

Part of what the Ukrainians need to sort out over the next few weeks is how to flip the balance back in favor of their forces.   One flaw with Western army doctrine is that much of this suppression of helicopter and airmobile forces was supposed to be accomplished through air superiority/dominance, so there's no real ground-based solution the Ukrainians can really request and get.    There are some Russian/ex-Soviet assets that can fill the space, but those are in shorter supply.   

Hard to say at the moment what will be an appropriate counter, but if there's a force that can engineer ad- hoc solutions, it would be the Ukrainians.",False,1687275690.0,t3_14e0cbv,t1_jotznp6,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

The first few months of the invasion were disaster after disaster as they got their asses kicked by the Ukrainian army. After that they started to get their act together a little bit and moved to a more “cautious” advance, which was pretty slow but inflicted less casualties on themselves. After that they moved towards the defensive which reduced their casualties further and gave them an easier task to achieve. 

That’s the Russian side of the story, massive incompetence in the beginning, but propped up by massive reserves of equipment left over from the soviet era, and then Small improvements later on and a recognition of their actual military abilities. 

 Now for the Ukrainians, it’s important to remember that Ukraine is not a small country, and it didn’t have a tiny military before the war. They had also received some training and equipment from nato and had experience with the war in Donbass. Those factors helped them to survive the initial weeks of the war, as their superior ability made up for shortages of equipment. Now as the war went on Ukraine’s stockpiles of equipment began to deplete and this is where the west has came in to resupply them. Ukraine’s military industry is not enough to sustain a war like this by itself, and so the west was pivotal in giving them more weapons and ammunition to use against Russia.

This actually isn’t an unprecedented situation, the Russian army has a historical reputation for underperforming relative to their size and supposed capabilities. They got torn to shreds in the winter war against a vastly inferior Finnish army. The fins only really lost because no other nation would give them military aid and they eventually got overwhelmed. Similarly the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya showed once again the poor state of the Russian military.

They’re GPD is worse than several states throughout America.

Also, the more important piece is the quality of the Russian military is god-awful. They are littered with mostly incompetent, poorly trained or people with zero training, badly motivated, soldiers. They have no NCO corps which means that there’s really no professional soldiers who have long-term experience and can accurately advice high ranking officers with combat advice. In general Russia’s military is like that of a lot authoritarian regimes, filled with weak soldiers who are intentionally made to be expendable by their government because if they had better training, that would require them to be able to think for themselves and make battlefield adjustments. Authoritarian leaders don’t like it when people question them. That goes for their militaries as well. Having a strong NCO corps and soldiers who are well trained means they might overthrow you if they decide you’re running a failed war.

The Russian military is terrible, and the Ukrainian military wisely ditched the old Russian system that the Russians still actively use in favor of a western model which promotes smarter better trained soldiers and a strong NCO corps.

Russia fucked up in their initial invasion and retreated, but still held various cities like Kherson and Kharkiv. Ukraine got help from various Western countries in terms of military equipment and intelligence, and through some counter offenses and pure incompetence on Russia's part, they took back Kharkiv and the part of Kherson north of the Dnipro river. 

Russia then ended up settling for the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. This has been the stalemate for the past almost year, with most of the fights being around the small cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka. 

Since Ukraine kept getting more and more Western aid, and especially artillery and anti-missile systems, they have been able to fight back. Russia is also getting help from Iran, and to some extent China, Belarus and North Korea, and they are getting quite battle hardened and not as incompetent anymore. 

So now we're in a situation were Russia have dug themselves in for the better part of a year in order to form a defensive line along the current frontline, and they are firing missiles and Iranian drones at Ukraine, and Ukraine is shooting down most of these missiles and drones with Western systems while also trying to take back some land through their current counter offensive. But it's going incredibly slowly. Some people speculate that it's because they are just doing probing attacks, while others say that maybe Ukraine is just struggling to fight back. 

I would say that Russia was incompetent, over-extended, and got caught and beat pretty bad in the initial phase of the invasion, while Ukraine received a lot of military aid and intelligence from Western countries. This caused the initial failure of the Russians. With both countries gaining more knowledge and experience and Russia trying to just keep the land it has stolen, the battlefield evened out and the current frontline formed, and it is a stalemate.

While I may have hoped for a complete rout like in the Kharkiv region I also understand that was a vastly different scenario. Russian forces have had over a year to prepare defensive lines and dig trenches, and while the Russian soldiers are probably as incompetent and lacking in morale, they, along with everyone else have been expecting this counter-offensive for months. So it was highly unlikely to repeat the same massive successes in the Kharkiv region.

However Ukraine seems to be playing at a strategy of finding a weak spot along the frontline and taking advantage of it. They've attacked at multiple areas along the south and made small gains throughout. And when you look at how long it took Russia to take Bakhmut, you'll see the Ukrainian counter-offensive is far more efficient. Sure, the battlefields are different, one being fought in the city and the other on open fields, but if Ukraine can take over the fields in the area outside a city it makes it that much easier to take the city as well. 

So if you look at it by the territory gained or lost in addition to the soldiers lost fighting for it, this has been highly successful for Ukraine. It may take time, but we're seeing Ukraine is making progress each day with far less casualties than Russia. And when Russia does make progress it takes massive casualties to conquer a fraction of the territory Ukraine could capture in far less time.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,14e0cbv,jouavga,"> Since the 13th June Ukraine shot down 7 helicopters, which is way over the average.

We don't actually know that. Over-reported air kills have been a consistent issue in this war since the very first days of the war when it was widely reported (falsely) that at least one and possibly two Russian IL-76s full of paratroopers were shot down near Kyiv. Months went by and there has still never been any detected crash site for any IL-76, ever, but the Ukrainian MoD maintained throughout that entire time that it had happened.

In situations where no kill is captured on video, or at least photographed later at a crash site, the report of a kill can come down to something as simple as a soldier in a manpad squad reporting to his superior that he scored a kill. Ukraine will report the kill with or without a better form of verification. This happens with both ground and air vehicles.

It's functionally no different from how the Allies reported vehicle kills during WW2 -- it often came down to the word of an individual pilot, who can end up being incorrect because (a) they think they saw something they didn't actually see correctly; (b) they believe they hit the vehicle but didn't see what happened to it, and they exaggerate, or (c) they fired a weapon at the target and want to report a kill but didn't actually see a hit.

These things happen regularly in war when kill counts are based on the word of individual soldiers or weapon crews. You should always assume that there's a decent margin of error in the overall tallies, especially when a military is claiming very, very high numbers of enemy vehicle kills without photographic evidence of the majority of those vehicle kills.

Edit: None of this is to say that it's all rosy for Russia's Ka-52s. They lost a *lot* of them at that airfield base near Kherson last year, due to simple Ukrainian artillery barrages of parked helicopters on the airfield. We have documented satellite coverage of that airfield showing repeated destruction and damaging of Ka-52s and other helicopters stationed there. We also have seen a few videos over the last 18 months of Ka-52s getting knocked straight out of the sky by well-placed manpad hits. I'm just saying, be patient and don't assume it's actually true that Russia's lost 7 Ka-52s in the last week.

Now there are many more platforms for anti armor that are much less vulnerable to the proliferation of man portable anti air platforms.

Even in places where it was actively used in ongoing war zones it’s use is limited.

Israel recently had its first Apache fire since then 2nd infanilda (sp?).

We used attack helicopters heavily in Iraq and Afghanistan as mobile fire support.

Throwing them into the teeth of  a modern army for anti tank duty is not smart.

They are best used as mobile fire support to provide flexible and overwhelming firepower in an area before withdrawing.

The big cost is training, and you have to look at the cost of training a group of pilots for a much cheaper attack helicopter versus the marginal cost of training for a very expensive plane.

Now with drones, you have an even cheaper alternative to fulfill many of their jobs, better anti armor options and a proliferation of anti air weapons.

From a Western point of view, much of the NATO combat aircraft inventory is constituted with planes that are equipped with a multi-role mission in mind, with very few airframes that are specialized, such as the A-10, F-22 and B-1/2/52. NATO warplanes are equipped with a full assortment of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions of varying ranges and precision guidance to accomplish missions ranging from air superiority/dominance to close air support, ranged interdiction, SEAD, anti-ship, etc. Their pilots are trained and exercised for proficiency in each of those roles as well.  You definitely have specialists in specialist aircraft, but in general, everyone can contribute in multiple aspects of combat.

The Russians on the other hand have always been investing in planes that are single-role. A majority of their fleet was built with the intent to contest for air superiority, with little capacity for air-to-ground support with anything but dumb bombs. That pretty much puts a majority of the air fleet at a disadvantage to support the ground war, leaving it up to planes such as the Su-24s, Su-25s,and Su-34s to perform those duties. In addition, most pilots have little to no experience in performing the air-to-ground mission. The Russians may have a lot of planes, but most of them are useless for the current conflict.

> Ukraine had nothing to oppose these ships, because the Ukrainian fleet lost 80% of its vessels after the occupation of Crimea in 2014. 

> But, on October 29, 2022, naval drones hit Russian ships, was carried out exclusively by unmanned devices. 

> Small and fast unmanned ships 3 Russian vessels were damaged, including the Admiral Makarov, flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. This is the first case in history where the attack was carried out exclusively by unmanned vessels. 

> The result of this daring operation was incredible - Russia has lost its undeniable advantage on the water. The killers of Ukrainian civilians — warships armed with missiles — became targets themselves. 

> Today, Ukraine starts assembling the world’s first Naval Fleet of Drones!

Sorry if this is a dumb question.

I assume that the Russians have dog tags that can be used to identify the deceased. I haven't seen any video of Ukraine forces collecting dog tags. When an open field has a dozen Russian corpses, it's probably too hazardous to collect them most of the time -- but we've seen many videos where UF troops are walking among dead Russians, *not* collecting dog tags even though it's safe to do so.

Wouldn't it be helpful for shaping Russian public opinion, if Ukraine put up a web site with the names from dog tags, so the families of KIA could find them and confirm that their father or brother or son is dead -- when the Russian MoD is listing them as MIA and therefore *not* paying the death benefit? **The dog tag web site would be a kindness to the families, would cost the MoD money, and might undercut support for the war.**

> The authorities told us that Ivan was MIA but here's proof that he's dead. Why is the Ministry of Defense lying to us? Where is our compensation?

IMO it's incredibly shitty that Russia is using the MIA excuse to avoid paying the death benefit, when soldiers have been MIA for *months*. Why not undercut that with a dog tags web site?

I have only spoken to him on a few occasions, he is definitely from Russian speaking part of Ukraine but we spoke in Ukrainian. I havent watched every video , just when something is happening or every second video or so. He is a typical doommer attitude and is very anti-Zelenskyy, but mainly for his policies, I think he respects that Zelenskyy has made the spirit of Ukraine stay alive. 

He probably has gotten some calls wrong, I do remember he made post saying the anti air missile which hit the farm in Poland was fired by Russia, once it was known it was an accident from Ukraine, I think from memory he said he was wrong in the end, but this was a long time ago now. 

You are right though, he doesnt get it all right I guess i am exaggerating but I think he is often correct with his assumptions. I think some people argue with his economic talk but Im not an expert there.

You can win with less “stuff” if you have a significantly better position and your opponent can’t utilise their material advantage, or you can gain a material advantage and blunt your opponents attacks until their material deficit starts to catch up with them and you eventually win. 

If we move this back to real life, yes Ukraine can “sacrifice” significant amounts of western equipment to gain a breakthrough, like you would in a chess game, but there needs to be a tangible advantage gained from this as well.

Railways are Russia's primary means of moving military hardware so they invested heavily into being able to build and repair them. And from my experience in Canada working alongside railways they can be repaired pretty quickly, and probably even more so by a country that specializes in rail transport for military means like Russia. 

And I'm not trying to trivialize this attack, because fuck Russia, I'm just pointing out their specialties and capabilities. However it's also worth pointing out this is probably beyond the normal scope of repairs making it more difficult. Rail lines need a good solid foundation to run along and if that's ruined it'll take longer to repair. Plus any attack that makes Russia have to divert more resources and manpower to repair and rebuild infrastructure is a plus. Especially here as the primary target seems to be the ammo dump, with the rail line destruction being the icing on top. And I also want to mention that different types of railway lines can be harder to repair than others. Because rail lines on flat ground are pretty simple; a solid foundational layer, railway ties and the rail itself is all it takes and most of that can be laid down real quick with specialized machinery. However if a bridge for a railway were hit that takes far longer as depending on the type of bridge and level of damage, you may have to divert water and pour concrete in addition to laying the rail, and all of that would require additional engineering and testing. Just look at how long it took the Kerch bridge repairs to be completed. And regardless all that work can be dangerous as well as they could be targeted also.

Russia maintains a LOT of railroad specific engineer units. They are the best equipped military in the world to handle this situation (Again, ON PAPER). They did this at the expense of traditional logistics via wheeled and tracked vehicles. If the RuAF have full manning and 100% available equipment, they pretty much can’t operate more than 150k from a railhead. Basically it’s the real reason the 3 days war failed. They can’t push that far that fast without the railroads. It’s absolutely batshit insane that they thought the northern offensive would be successful when they mostly ignored the railroads. There’s things you can fix fast. For example the sabotage incidents causing derailments on a typical rail grade. That’s only a couple hour problem for people who don’t give a shit about environmental impact or OSHA. Then there’s a dropped bridge which will take months in peacetime and far longer under fire. All the UA had to do was drop a few bridges and the northern offensive was doomed.

That said, I think the biggest damage here to Russia is material lost, not repairing the line, which they still (somehow?) seem to be at least moderately competent at. Frankly, and this is my personal opinion; it might be the one thing they do/have done well so far.

No one knows for sure. Everyone except about two intelligence agencies (US and UK) believed Russia wouldn't be so crazy to invade Ukraine and risk complete economic isolation, yet they did.

Putting the question aside of whether Russia would just tuck its tail inbetween its legs and leave Ukraine over confronting NATO, deploying troops there was utterly unrealistic. I say this as a former US military officer who did several deployments to Eastern Europe since 2014. It takes *time* and *consensus* to set up a sustainable war effort.

I suppose my point is that I shake my head and groan every time someone says NATO could have avoided this. No - that's not NATO's job. Our job is to secure our member states with the threat of utter annihilation of any enemy who would attack us.

We're not arguing that, its a fact. [Shooting guided missiles from a safe distance at tanks is quite literally how an attack helicopter is supposed to attack them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare#Helicopter). Of course their use is intended, do you think [Vikhr rockets from 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K121_Vikhr) just fell from the sky and are now being used as a bad compromise? I dont the Ka-52 even has unguided rockets intended for anti-armor combat, only for attacking runways and fortifications.

The way russians are using them right now is the way helicopters are supposed to perform anti-armor attacks. That you're somehow stuck in a ""they should shoot unguided missiles at them from close range"" fire support mind set is exactly the ""outdated tactics"" you're talking about. This war is not afghanistan where there is pretty much no resistance from your target and subsequently they're used the way they've always been intended to. Do you think AA and SPAAGs did not exist in the cold war? MANPADS and systems like the Gepard exist since the 50s to 60s and current attack helicopters are designed exactly with that threat in mind - by shooting missiles from several kilometers behind the current frontline.

And if you still dont believe me despite its role being so painfully obvious, just read the Wikipedia article on attack helicopters:

> I then pointed out its original armor killing role was in the 1980s and they shifted it use as a result because it could no longer wipe out armored columns with impunity as readily due to the proliferation of anti air technology.

That anti air technology existed before that attack helicopter was even designed. As i said, the threats to helicopters doing close air support existed from the very beginning of the cold war and never stopped existing. The famous Stinger is from 1980 and its predecessor from 1967. The Gepard is from 1976 for the very purpose of keeping helicopters at a distance. Attack helicopters could *never* attack armored columns in the way you are thinking they would. The tactic of ""shoot a guided missile from tree cover"" never changed, the rockets and their range simply got better.

> I then pointed out that the Russians rely on its BVR long range missiles, and you appear to agree that it evolved that way in the 90s. 

I do not. Helicopters have always used guided anti tank missiles from great distances as they'd otherwise be shot down. They simply got even more focussed on that purpose in the 90s as the tech got better. I honestly don't even know what you think they did before that or what they should be doing today instead. Its text book anti-armor fighting back then and today.

> I then pointed out that this is ad hoc use in place of diminishing munition supplies and that they risk losing chopters in firefighting situations where they run low on long range munitions.

You're not pointing that out, you're just claiming that. So far theres no sign of russian forces running out of ammunition or artillery pieces. Its just way easier to kill a tank on the move with an attack helicopter than trying to hit it with artillery. And throwing *both* ATGMs from helicopters and artillery against an offensive is even better. The only reason russia hasn't done that in the early phase of the war is that they were on a very disorganized offensive and thats where the helicopters were under increased threat from MANPADS because they couldnt hide behind the frontline.
