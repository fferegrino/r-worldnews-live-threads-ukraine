Day 84 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It looks like shelling has returned, well, at least partially. That explosion we heard yesterday turned out to be shelling, what did they target? A fire department, a very high value target apparently. They destroyed 2 fire trucks and damaged some buildings around them, including an apartment building.

After that they also shelled us some more during the day, as usual they shelled Saltivka and a couple more districts, we heard those explosions from here, but at the time we didn’t know that it was shelling. There past couple of hours weren’t quiet either, we often hear explosions not that far away from us, and getting ready to hide in case we get shelled again.

I really don’t understand why they are shelling us again, they are getting pushed back, yet they are still wasting their ammo on useless targets like apartment buildings and fire trucks, that are not even anywhere near the frontline, instead of actually fighting back.
 
It’s funny because this is exactly what they are accusing us of, that is, shelling our own cities instead of fighting them. That is exactly what we are seeing now but in reverse, our forces are fighting them off, and instead of fighting back they choose to shell our cities, which won’t help them win any battles.

More on topic of their weird obsession with military and Victory Day, I’ll just tell about one of the conversations we had on social media with one of our “friends”. As always when talking to Russians we usually ask them what is the point of this war? 

This one person answered that “well, you (Ukrainians) haven’t been celebrating Victory Day much,” apparently not celebrating some old holiday is a grave offense now. So what they are saying is that because we didn’t celebrate their holiday the way they wanted, it’s okay to invade our country, raze our cities and kill our people.

And as a cherry on top, this same person said to us “it’s a shame that you (Ukrainians) have been getting brainwashed for 30 years”. Yeah, we were brainwashed into thinking that we can be friends with Russia, but they promptly undid that brainwashing on day 1 of this war, when we were woken up by Russian shelling at 5 am.

Update 4:18 AM.
Just about 15 minutes ago there was an extremely loud explosion nearby, which shook the whole building and right after there were reports of shelling and a fire starting somewhere, though I can't confirm the fire part, can't see it from any of my windows.

From CNN's Tim Lister, Olga Voitovych and Julia Presniakova

The Ukrainian armed forces say they have recaptured another settlement in the Kharkiv region, as troops continue their counter-attacks in the area.

They also reported heavy fighting in the Luhansk region, where Russian forces continue attempts to destroy Ukrainian defenses.

In Kharkiv, the general staff said Wednesday that ""as a result of the offensive of our troops, the settlement of Dementiivka was liberated.""

Dementiivka is about 20 miles (35 kilometers) north of Kharkiv.

The general staff said fighting continued in other parts of the area and Russian forces were advancing around the village of Ternova, close to the border north-east of Kharkiv. 

The Russians appear to be trying to block Ukrainian forces from advancing towards their nearby supply lines inside Ukraine.

Elsewhere the Ukrainian National Guard reported that in Luhansk region, its Rapid Reaction Brigade had destroyed bridges to stop the advance of Russian forces towards the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Video posted by the National Guard indicates the bridges were destroyed in the past few days.  

It said that blowing up the bridges would help the defense of areas still under Ukrainian control.

In the same area, the general staff reported air strikes against several towns along the front lines, as well as areas around the town of Bakhmut, a key hub for Ukrainian defensive efforts. It said that attempts to break through Ukrainian lines in the Adviivka area had been repelled.

Ukrainian units also continue to hold off Russian forces trying to advance south into Donetsk region, according to the general staff, which said they inflicted losses on the Russians around Dovhenke, north-west of the strategically important city of Sloviansk.

Ukrainian fighters have blown up an armoured train carrying Russian troops using an explosive device in the occupied southern city of Melitopol, the Ukrainian territorial defence force said today. 

Russia's Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a written request for comment. 

The city of Melitopol in the region of Zaporizhzhia lies in a belt of southern Ukrainian land that was occupied by Russian forces after they invaded on 24 February.

The Ukrainian territorial defence, the reservist branch of the armed forces, said an explosive device detonated directly under a carriage carrying servicemen.

She'd been calm and composed until now. She too spent more than two months in one of the bunkers under the vast industrial facility with her two sons where the bombardment felt like it would never end.


Behind us, her two boys, aged 6 and 11, were playing with guns made from paper and duct tape.



As the two boys duck and dive behind the trees in the park, they pretend they're fighting Russians. At one point they drop to the ground and shout 'cover your ears'. One gives the shout of 'all clear' and they stand up and get going again.



It's haunting to watch.



Even the games with the guns feel realistic as they practice putting in a fresh magazine of bullets. They have obviously seen this up close.

From CNN's Paul P. Murphy 

Ukrainian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region targeted a Russian tank, with the tank firing back as well, according to new videos circulating on social media. 

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the videos. It's unclear when the firefight with the tank happened, but it took place near the village of Nove, just 8 miles (about 12 kilometers) south of the Ukraine-Russia border. 

The three videos show a Russian tank near a network of trenches dug on the western shoulder of Highway 105. Troops are seen in the trenches, but it's unclear whether they are Russian or Ukrainian. 

The Russian tank was seen on fire, spinning around and then firing. 

Although it's unclear how the tank caught on fire, the second video gives some indication of what may have started it. In the video, the tank was seen heading north back toward the border and Russian-occupied territory, as well as toward a Ukrainian soldier equipped with a shoulder-fired missile. 

The tank fired repeatedly in the direction where the soldier was last seen.

In a third video, a shoulder fired-missile was seen almost hitting the tank. Suddenly, the tank was seen firing and then crashing into a line of trees on the side of the road.",False,1652895089.0,t3_usbxq0,t3_usbxq0,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Speaking at a press conference in Germany, Yellen said it is “reasonably likely” to expect the license will be allowed to expire on May 25. 

“There has not been a final decision on that. But I think it’s unlikely it would continue,” Yellen said. 

Such a move would effectively block Russia from paying US bondholders, raising the risk of a default. Russia has not defaulted on its foreign debt since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago. 

US sanctions introduced after Russia invaded Ukraine ban transactions with Russia’s central bank, finance ministry and national wealth fund. However, the Treasury Department issued a license that allows for transactions related to debt payments.

“When we first imposed sanctions on Russia, we created an exemption that would allow a period of time for an orderly transition to take place and for investors to be able to sell securities,” Yellen said. “And the expectation was that it was time-limited.”

Yellen signaled she is not concerned about the potential spillover caused by ending the license.

“Russia is not able right now to borrow in global financial markets. It has no access to capital markets,” Yellen said. “If Russia is unable to find a legal way to make these payments and they technically default on their debt, I don’t think that really represents a significant change in Russia’s situation. They’re already cut off from global capital markets and that would continue.”

From Isil Sariyuce in Istanbul

Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesperson for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held phone calls with his counterparts from Sweden and Finland as well as Germany, the US and the UK to discuss NATO membership applications of Sweden and Finland, among other topics.

“In the context of Sweden and Finland's membership applications to NATO, the expectation that concrete steps will be taken to address Turkey's national security concerns was communicated. It was underlined that if Turkey's expectations were not met, the progress of the process would not be possible,” according to a readout of the meeting.

“During the meetings, it was also emphasized that it is unacceptable to allow the terrorist organization PKK/PYD/YPG and FETO members to exist in NATO members and other countries. It was stated that there should be no discrimination between terrorist organizations and that all forms of terrorism should be fought in a spirit of unity and solidarity,” the readout added.

Erdogan has accused the two countries of harboring members of the separatist militant Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and supporters of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of masterminding a 2016 coup attempt, which Gulen denies. The PKK has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Erdogan also said Sweden did not extradite 30 people whom Turkey sees linked to terrorism. 

According to the readout, the reversal of defense export bans and of sanctions against Turkey were also addressed.

Earlier on Wednesday, Erdogan told his party's members of parliament in Ankara that he expects NATO member countries to “understand” Turkey’s security issues.

- What happened to Russian supply lines after their failed Zerg rush towards Kyiv seems to have been a combination of territorial defense and partisan activity

2. The West doesn't want Ukraine to win fast, they want to exhaust Russia, so Western weapon supplies are limited. US refuses to start training pilots for F-16, provide MLRS systems, Abrams.

3. The current state of the war is stalemate. Ukraine doesn't have enough strength to liberate all or majority of the captured territories, and Russian army is very far from being defeated - they have a huge mobilization resource, and huge stockpiles of Soviet equipment. The war can last for a very long time.

Even though almost no countries consider Crimea as part of Russia, Russia does and that is directly tied to their nuclear doctrine. An existential threat to Russia calls for a nuclear strike, according to their doctrine. So the solution will have to be more nuanced. I've seen others evoke a neutral zone, a handover x years in the future, and many other peaceful solutions. However, it is true that Russia will not return Crimea with the current administration in power. I believe the entourage of Putin realizes what an utter failure their war has been, militarily and economically. The next leader that comes along might just want to accept defeat and move on, because this is not sustainable for Russia in every sense. The true existential threat to Russia is its current leadership. The next leader will need to rebuild Russia, and you cannot do that if you can't take and you're spendinga billion a day fighting for territory that is constantly going to be at war, and practically unusable land.

What I'm worried about is that Russia has deported Ukrainians from occupied regions and replaced them with Russians. How do you since this problem once you take back the land? It's a massive issue. How do you repatriate your citizens when you have no clue where they're held? They will need a cooperative ruler of Russia to do this.

I don't want to defend Turkey, but there's little that justifies the intentional murder of civilians. The PKK has done awful things. But I don't want to defend Turkey. As the more powerful faction who created the world that recruits for the PKK, Turkey's elite deserves heavy criticism. 

Turkey's obviously repressive measures have involved the intentional murder of Kurdish civilians since 1919 with little to no accountability on military war crimes (done in times of peace). More recently, everything from jobs to governorships includes systemic repression. And a whole lot of micro aggressions which obviously create mass anger. A nation deserves criticism if entire ethnic groups within that nation are unhappy. Something is rotten in the state of Turkey. 


But it's all irrelevant. Sweden is not defending the PKK. They are defending the human rights of Kurdish emigres. The Turkish regime is behaving like the Russian regime or the Assad Syrian regime. Intentionally conflating groups under a demonized umbrella. Here is the example:

He’s a veteran of the first conflict and he clearly works with the Ukrainian military to help facilitate any requests since his organization takes donations to help supply the war effort. But this guy has no information about anything specific to decision making within the US military. 

It’s honestly hard to take someone who says these things seriously… Anyone can Google this shit… The “b course” for platforms (F16 for example) takes 9 months to complete, nvm any courses US pilots need to take after, but regardless this is the course Ukrainian pilots would HAVE to start at. Surely you understand why you can’t just take all Ukrainian pilots off the line to start training them now, that seems obvious… 

So even in a world where the US military can condense this course, plus consolidate any other courses, it would still take months. You would have to train a handful of pilots at a time, so you know Ukraine still has an Air Force to fight it’s current war. And then keep doing this over and over again until you’ve finally trained enough/all of them, that’s a LONG time. And this doesn’t even TOUCH on the fact you would also need to simultaneously train small numbers of ground crews to actually maintain said aircraft. Again you can’t take all these people off the line to abandon the current aircrafts they maintain.

I have to say if Ukraine was not prepared then they would not be standing now, western help or not. Russia went for every major city but only got Kherson through sabotage and Mariupol due to proximity. Though it could be argued that their borders especially at the south should practically nailed shut but how much of that would have been possible before the war?

2 is nonsense. As much as it would be great to weaken Russia no one is willing to do it at the expense of their countries, economy, resources etc. We spent weeks debating this so much so some wanted ceasefire, Ukraine to surrender etc. This is just conspiracy. 

Any delay on providing certain weapons is just govts esp US being over cautious and wary of escalation which is annoying. Because I agree the occupied south being liberated will need another round of higher level and longer range weapons. The strategy seems to be to reach the end of each phase then assess what weapons are needed for the next one rather then providing them at once and I can see how that is frustrating. 

I don't understand the stalemate argument for all fronts, sure for Kherson and Zaiporzhia regions but there are offensives in other areas going on now. Or does he want fighting on all fronts at once? Also the Ukrainians have stated their plans of June/July being when they expect full counter offensive on all areas to have started.

The talking point Turks and Erdogan simps blindly repeat is that because the US calls the PKK terrorist --> PKK is evil --> QED Profit. 

This obscures more than it helps. The PKK is deemed a terrorist group by many nations in the West largely if not entirely because of constant Turkish pressure to do so. Nobody wants a major NATO power to be unhappy, so many nations of NATO support the faction with power, instead of the largely irrelevant and weak PKK.

The PKK militantly fights for freedom against Turkey, so in Ankara's eyes they are evil terrorists. A comparative example seems to be the IRA.

> Approximately 18,000 members of the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines participated in exercises Desert Rock VII and VIII during Operation Plumbbob. The military was interested in knowing how the average foot-soldier would stand up, physically and psychologically, to the rigors of the tactical nuclear battlefield.

If nuclear war ever happened, the USA wanted to have trained soldiers who saw nukes firsthand, to be psychologically prepared and lead the rest of the troops into battle.

The wargame battlefield was littered with pigs, to see exactly the radius at which injuries and/or instant-death would occur. Planning how far you can throw a nuke and how close your military could be to it to survive. Etc. etc.

 >Karelia Suite, Op. 11 is a subset of pieces from the longer Karelia Music (named after the region of Karelia) written by Jean Sibelius in 1893 for the Viipuri Students' Association and premiered, with Sibelius conducting, at the Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, on 23 November of that year. Sibelius first conducted the shorter Suite ten days later; it remains one of his most popular works. Karelia Music was written in the beginning of Sibelius's compositional career, and the complete Music consists of an Overture, 8 Tableaux, and 2 Intermezzi; it runs for about 44 minutes, whereas the Suite lasts about 12 minutes.

Because there's a very good chance that this war is still going to be 'hot' for several months or years.

I have a lot of optimism that Russian forces are so badly damaged (including morale) that we'll hit a breaking point soon, and Russian territorial gains are just going to collapse all in the space of a few days.

This depends, of course, on Ukraine being able to sustain destruction of dug-in Russian forces, at a higher rate than Russia can resupply and reinforce, and that second rate, we assume, declines rapidly as Russia's economy declines, and Russia's ability to prepare troops and equipment in storage declines.  

Eventually, Russia's going to hit sort of an equilibrium where they can maintain their forces and permanently occupy territory.  Ukraine's ability to take that territory back will steadily ramp up with more equipment grants.  But when those two curves level-out, Ukraine will be forced to be more aggressive and take more risks, and suffer worse troop losses. This is all going to take months or years to play out, and in the meantime, if they can resume ""normal"" government functions like Justice, then that's good for the Ukrainian people.

Even if Russia is completely ejected from Ukrainian territory, Russia can continue to launch attacks on Ukrainian cities and people via cruise missiles, either launched from ships in the Caspian, or subs in the Black Sea, or bombers over Russian territory. As long as Russia refuses to accept loss of territory, or until those capabilities are destroyed. And Ukraine doesn't have a way of destroying those capabilities, and probably will not have a way to do that for at least the next several years.  At some point, Ukraine's going to need some form of defense against these weapons, and if that takes the form of wiping out Russia's sub fleet, or their missile flotilla in the Caspian, or Russia's bomber squadrons, or Russia's stockpile of cruise missiles - then those acts are going to be considered highly escalatory by Russia. Personally, I think Ukraine has the right to pursue this course of action - but again, it will be YEARS before Ukraine has the kind of security any modern nation needs to rebuild.  As long as Russia retains these capabilities.  It makes no sense to put civilization (and Justice for war criminals) on-hold in the meantime.",1652883888.0,1652883591.0,t3_usbxq0,t1_i92id72,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

I'm not accusing you of that, but it is a coping method that applies to many people. Unfortunately I've seen many people who value false calm in all things devaluing other people's honest reactions.

Calm on the spot is necessary for someone in charge who needs to maintain authority and take the correct action, but this is Reddit. People posting here aren't choosing troop movements. This is exactly the place to put a comment on how someone feels about the news.

People have different responses to news that causes confusion, horror and grief.

Some people can have an emotional response that lasts seven minutes and they're onto the next thing. There are others that put a clamp on top of all feelings and concerns, which makes them feel as though they're in control. They're not, but they feel entitled to tell others to stay calm like they are.

Emotional people find the calm ones heartless, calm people find the emotional ones hysterical, but they're both valid paths to coping.

You can't evaluate for others that their seven-minute freakout that's perfectly normal is more adaptive to the 'This is Fine' meme approach.

Being profoundly detached is what allows people to declare wars and make horrifically predatory political deals and decide it's 'just business.'

In the evolution of this thread, there have been a lot of maladaptive demands for calm and a lot of people who came here hoping for community, help or support being abused. Granted, it's not the standard place for it - support - but there's no reason that those who are calm, educated and concerned can't aid those who are freaked out, missing information and feeling lost.

Personality types, gender bias and cultural differences can end up with good-willed people missing intentions.

It's hard to not see a male-gender standard of denial and calm applied to female-gender standards of empathy and immersion in individual details. It could also be a British stiff-upper-lip standard of ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" (which when carried too far can be toxic) applied to something like an American standard of ""Tell everyone everything you think all the time as a social-media update"" which is also toxic when taken too far. 

That being said, I don't believe your evaluation that others need to 'move on' is your call. Your advice might be helpful for those that have that goal.
