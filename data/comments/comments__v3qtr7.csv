Day 100 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling was pretty bad, especially in the evening. There were couple MLRS barrages that landed somewhere in my neighborhood during the day, and around 9-10pm it got even worse, explosions were happening very close to us, so we were hiding in the bathroom for some time. Explosions were being reported from all around the city, they were shelling many districts at the same time for a couple hours, but it quieted down recently. 

A hundred days of this mindless war have already passed, and it still feels surreal. Never thought that a war like this was ever possible, but Putin thought otherwise. Seriously, before this war started we were laughing about it, wondering why people are panicking, because why would Russia attack us, right? 

We believed that there would be no war until the very end, so when it actually started, it caught us by surprise. We had a lot of friends from Russia; we also have Russian family and relatives, so we didn’t think they could attack us. The very thought of them attacking our country seemed absurd, but that quickly changed on the first day of the war.

What was even weirder is that all the people we knew, including our Russian family and relatives, suddenly changed. When we said to them that we are being shelled, and that bombs are being dropped from planes right on our heads they responded “no, that’s not happening and you are lying” It drove us insane, and it still does, how can people we were so close with just not believe our words, what is this madness?

Most of them still don’t believe us, and of those who do, most are already over it, they don’t even care that there’s a war. A lot of them even stopped asking if we are fine here. When a message from your literal family is basically just “You alive?” you can see just how much they care about you.

I’m really grateful to everyone for their support during this senseless war, it really means a lot to us. It is pretty unbelievable that so many people care about strangers they don’t even know, but I’m really thankful for it. Sadly it looks like this war will still go on for at least another 100-200 days, and I will continue to write my updates until the end, never thought that I would be doing this, but this war really infuriated me.",1654303862.0,1654303778.0,t3_v3qtr7,t3_v3qtr7,,0,142,0,142,2,0,

“From the beginning, I’ve said — and not everyone’s agreed with me — nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. It’s their territory. I’m not going to tell them what they should and shouldn’t do,” Biden said in Rehoboth, Delaware. 

Biden did add that it “appears” at some point there will need to be a “settlement” between the two countries, adding “what that entails, I don’t know.”

**How Western heavy weaponry can make a difference in the war in Ukraine**

(...)

*Despite much deliberation in the West, there seemed to be a drastic shift after the U.S. approved the transfer of a number of M142 HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine in late May.*  
  
*The HIMARS and their munitions are expected to be part of a new $700 million aid package that also includes a lot more hardware, such as counter-fire radars, new FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank weapons, artillery rounds, vehicles, and spare parts.*   
  
*Moreover, as it became known on June 1, the United Kingdom also requested the U.S. give the green light to provide Ukraine with M270, an even heavier and more advanced rocket system produced in the U.S.*   
  
*The U.S. supply follows a series of advanced tubed artillery transfers, particularly 155-millimeter M777 howitzers, a new holy grail to Ukraine’s military community that has already been deployed to war zones.*  
  
*Ukraine is hoping for a break.*

From CNN's Tim Lister and Olga Voitovych.

On the 100th day of war, Russian forces appear to have made little headway in the last 24 hours as they try to break Ukrainian resistance along the border of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. In the south, a Ukrainian counteroffensive is making progress, according to Ukrainian officials.

In Luhansk, shelling of defensive positions around Severodonetsk continues, according to the Ukrainian military's Friday update. The military reported Russian air strikes in the area as well. But the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claimed that ""the enemy tried to carry out assault operations, suffered losses, and retreated to previous positions.""

The military reported damage to properties in Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Hirske, adding that one woman died.

Oleksandr Motuzianyk, the Ukrainian defense ministry's spokesman, said the Russians persisted in efforts to surround Ukrainian troops near Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. But Ukrainian units had thwarted Russian efforts to seize the nearby towns of Metiolkine and Bilohorivka, he said. Russian forces continued assault operations in residential areas of Severodonetsk but suffered casualties.

The military said Ukrainian units inflicted heavy losses — ""at least 50% of the personnel, weapons and equipment"" — on the 150th Motorized Rifle Division. There is no way to independently verify that claim.

In Donetsk, fighting continued along much of the front line, with 14 towns and villages coming under fire, the general staff said. Russian forces are trying to degrade Ukrainian defenses around Bakhmut and Sloviansk. Motuzianyk later said that Russian attempts to take two villages about 20 kilometers (or about 12 miles) northwest of Sloviansk had failed.

Altogether, the Ukrainian military reported that at least seven civilians were killed and eight were injured in the past 24 hours in Luhansk and Donetsk, but as usual gave no casualty figures for the military. It said that over the past 24 hours,1,472 people had been evacuated from areas of hostilities.

In the southern region of Kherson, the Ukrainians say their offensive continues, and attempts by Russian forces to recover lost ground had failed. The Kherson regional military administration said fighting continued in the Beryslav district. 

""We had victories from the Kryvyi Rih direction for three days in a row, villages were liberated. The occupier tried to counterattack today, but got a very strong rebuff, and our Armed Forces pushed the occupier back even further,"" said Serhii Khlan, an adviser to the head of the Kherson regional council.
Khlan also claimed that resistance inside Kherson was growing.

""Our people continue to resist in the occupied territories. Every day we see flags appear in the city of Kherson, slogans appear against the occupiers, as well as leaflets,"" he said.

Ukrainian forces appear to have advanced several kilometers inside Kherson. The Operational Command South said Russia had shipped in nearly 30 infantry fighting vehicles to reinforce their units and were shelling villages far behind the front lines. It also said that Russian forces had resumed shelling of settlements south of Kryvih Rih and of the city of Mykolaiv, where two people had been killed.

In the northeast, Russian shelling around Kharkiv continued, killing one person, according to the regional military administration. About six settlements came under fire from artillery and rocket systems.

Russia has accused Germany of throwing European security into imbalance by “remilitarising”, as Berlin moves to boost its military spending in response to Moscow’s invasion.

In comments published in German newspapers this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would soon have the largest conventional army of NATO’s European members.

“We perceive the statement of the German chancellor as yet another confirmation that Berlin has set a course for an accelerated remilitarisation of the country. How could this end? Alas, this is well known from history,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

Scholz pledged in February to sharply increase defence spending and inject 100 billion euros ($107bn) into Germany’s armed forces, marking a major policy shift for the military after decades of attrition following the end of the Cold War. Politicians were expected to vote on the spending plan on Friday.

“At a time when it is necessary to look for opportunities to reduce common threats, Germany, on the contrary, takes the path of escalating the military-political situation on the European continent, directing tens of billions of euros to increase the critical mass of weapons,” Zakharova said

The toilet paper, having travelled half the way under pouring rain in trucks with leaky roofs, of course, has fully soaked and without drying it is unsuitable for use (the question of large-scale hanging of the toilet paper to dry is being agreed with the command right now).

> The task of destroying own troops was made easier for the command of the 35th army by the fact that, first of all, the army transferred from Far East, without the elements attached to it later, initially represented an incomplete corps with just two full motorised brigades forming the main strike force, and secondly, the forces were driven into the woods to fight the enemy, generally reproducing the conditions of the Hürtgen forest meat grinder of autumn-winter 1944 in the Western front of the Second World War, where the Germans managed for a while to successfully hold off the advance of the allies using only partially combat-ready units, using the terrain, strongpoints and a well-functioning fire system, primarily artillery.

> The command of the army only needed to ensure that the forces would not get the necessary means to create various field fortifications and shelters. In forest conditions, when a major part of the enemy missiles and bombs explode at the top of the trees showering everything with shrapnel, this in general solves the question of destroying the personnel and light armoured, vehicles, half of which at the moment are non-functional for technical reasons, and another half - due to damage from said shrapnel.

> The army command succeeded with this task. From tools for mechanisation and fortification construction, the whole army had around 20 trench charges capable of somewhat increasing the speed of constructing one platoon-level strongpoint. There were not enough BSL-110 spades, picks were missing completely. The lack of spades for construction of at least some form of shelters was compensated by buying up spades from all around the area. At the same time the vehicles parked without shelters for which there were not tools to dig them out, were methodically being destroyed by the enemy.

> Since the army did not have any volunteers capable of promptly purchasing and delivering at least some civilian communication equipment, the communications during the main period of hostilities were provided in the first line of battle formation by, at best, field phones TA-57, but for the most part - by messengers.

> The enemy however, equipped with modern communication tools and using UAVs freely and on a large-scale, including commercial drones, had an opportunity to deliver substantial blows to our troops taking minimal effort to do so during the hostilities.

> Thus, by early June the numbers of combat-ready infantry in certain motorised brigade battalions of the army successfully reached 12-15 people (64th brigade), the combined number of 38th and 64th motorised brigades - less than 100 of truly combat-ready infantry in each brigade.

> Wagner and Redut PMCs refused to assault the enemy positions in this area, saying they are not paid THAT MUCH money.

> This correspondence received from a battle participant on our side allows us to have the correct answer to the question - ""How successfully can the Russian army transfer and bring into combat the combined-arms formations across the whole country?""

> The answer is - NO FUCKING WAY, BLYAT!

> Fight with shoe polish and soaked toilet paper.

The first ship from Mariupol loaded with metal arrived at the port of Rostov-on-Don

The first ship from Mariupol, loaded with metal, arrived in the Rostov region, a representative of Rostov Port JSC told RIA Novosti.

 , since the end of April, about 12,000 explosive objects have been neutralized in the port and in the water area.

  
At the end of May, a  
ship with about three thousand tons of metal products left for Rostov-on-Don .

24, Russia has been conducting a  
special military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine . Vladimir Putin called its goal ""the

eight years."" The Russian army has completed the main task of the  
first stage - it has significantly reduced the combat potential of  
Ukraine. The main goal of the operation in the Russian defense department  
was called the liberation of Donbass

(...)

*Outside of the cafe, we strike up a conversation with Dima, a police officer from Lyman who has been fighting in the city. Dima paints a picture of a dedicated fighting force that is being outgunned and bombarded by the Russian military, of frequent air raids and a lack of capability to defend against them. “The fact that they’ve \[the Americans\] given us Howitzers—it’s all good and dandy but how many of them did they give us? For our little region, Slovyansk region and Kramatorsk region—five, seven, ten things. It’s too few. It’s ridiculous,” he says. “They don’t give us tanks, don’t give us air defense because they’re fucking worried that we’ll shoot Russia.”*

*Frustrations, and an increased willingness to express them, are growing among some of the soldiers on the Donbas fronts—both with a lack of support from Western nations who are slow to make heavy weapons deliveries, and with Ukrainian leaders who they think are not recognizing the sacrifices of those from, and fighting, in the region.*

*“You look and you see that there are priorities—big cities. Kharkiv… Kyiv is the most important… But what about us? Do we not want to live on our land, in our home? We worked honestly, earned money honestly. To be left without all this? And OK if it’s just without a home, but what about being left without your loved ones?” he says, growing impassioned.*

*(...)*

tl;dr it isn't easy, send more weapons.

*“We need heavy weapons: howitzers, tanks. Javelins are not enough,” Yuri says. “They’ve got howitzers, tanks, planes, helicopters. This war and the next are going to be wars of equipment,” he adds, noting that this battle is nothing like the one fought here in 2014. Instead, he says, it’s more comparable to 1941, a battle of vehicles and equipment.*

(...) 

*War in the Donbas appears to be settling in for the long haul, and it will be won not only in the declarations of powerful politicians, but here in the trenches by men and women like Yuri, Hussein, and Dima, who fight only to be able to once again lead normal lives in their homeland.*

* So it's up to Ukraine to buy as much time as possible for West's longer range weapons to arrive en masse. And when that happens, Russia will be pushed back further and further. Even if they entrenched themselves to secure occupied lands, the longer range artilleries and rockets would pound them from too far for them to fight back. Thus a retreat seems more probable.
* Ukraine's counteroffensive near Kherson is a huge genius stroke. Not only does this stretch Russian forces further apart, but if successful then Crimea will be threatened. 
* If Ukraine can hold out to winter then Russia will again be forced to use roads (in single columns) which Ukraine will pound them with western weapons.",False,1654288251.0,t3_v3qtr7,t3_v3qtr7,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

After all the bluffing, the cards are down…. and Russia is caught short.

Anything but a significant increase in men and equipment from Russia within the next few days (not weeks), Russia will be on the run.

The critical thing right now is how Russia responds. It’s now getting beaten, does it have the political and economic strength to change this trajectory?

It’s seems that Russias business as usual model to their fighting is leading to a defeat.

Can they commit the extra resources and make the needed changes?

We will found out over the next two weeks.

Silence from the Russian leadership in the next two weeks means that Putin et al’s attention is focussed inward. That would lead to significant defeats for Russias.

Now up-front - do I think this is true? Probably not.

So to work out whether I'm right/wrong, I'll try and prove the opposite of what I think...

***How do I think it's possible or plausible?***

In a concept - to get Russia to concentrate its forces in one area in order to exploit some sort out outcome from that concentration.

The three major options would be:

1. To encircle and destroy.

2. To force a concentration on supply lines to target

3. To weaken other areas in the theatre to enable gains in other areas.


If I were to put money on anything, I'd say 2. with a bit of 3.

Supply lines are dense going to Izyum, and those lines are exposed to a concerted offensive NE and E from Kharkiv...

For my recent post on what Ukraine's Summer offensive may look like head to my comment on it..  [https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/v286fz/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/iar5o0z?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/v286fz/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/iar5o0z?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

So if that offensive eventuates, we're looking at some significant troop and supply lines concentrations between Izyum and Severodeonestsk. So....... It's a maybe.

On 3. we've possibly already seen some of this in Kherson Oblast.

So maybe possible on Ukraine's part.

Do I think it's true now then? Probably not. I think they've just taken an opportunity as it arose, I'm not sure it was a coordinated and planned trap.

BUT I can guarantee you, Ukraine's military leadership would have had time to plan something like this if they wanted to.

In military planning, different mission concepts and possibilities are always being worked on. So it is technically possible to plan for this, given how the battle lines have been for some time and Russias shifting goals to focus on the East.

This Ukrainian Summer offensive is going to be interesting to assess and analyse, that's for sure.

It was the Ukrainian army raping women and children in occupied settlements. It was the UA army doing this, the UA army doing that.

On the other hand, if Turkiye is going to ensure it gets where it's supposed to go, then they might be just thinking about the bigger picture. Still means they're supporting Russia.

I mean, when taken in conjunction with other Turkish actions, it's a real conundrum:

+ Closing the Bosphorus - favours NATO, but barely, because it could come back to bite them too

+ Buying Russian S-400 AA - favours Russia

+ Giving Bayraktar drones to Ukraine/Estonia in some cases for free - favours NATO (but is the action of a private citizen, not the country as a whole)

+ Delaying/blocking Sweden and Finland from joining NATO - favours Russia

+ Buying stolen grain from Russia - favours Russia

+ Fighting Assad in Syria - favours NATO

+ Fighting Kurdish rebels in Syria - favours Russia

+ Eroding its own democracy - favours Russia

Turkiye is *all over the place* when it comes to its actions, but on the whole, the general trend is against NATO common interests, in favour of Russia, and is primarily the product of the current regime, it's flip-flopped in all directions in terms of who is in power.

Russia has a shit-ton of people they COULD press into service. (this would depend on Putin's domestic support, which SEEMS strong - it's hard to know this though).

Russia may be digging deep into their equipment reserves after suffering horrible losses, but do rest-assured, that Russia has a massive stockpile of howitzers and ammunition. This is mainly what's tying Ukraine down right now, and they need a game-changer in this area.  The other thing is that even though Russia's production capability has been crippled, they can still make shit tons of howitzers and shells.

Yes, the M777 is a game-changer - but they only got like 100 of these. They need 1000 or more.

Also, yes, HIMARS is a major game-changer in this area.  But again, Ukraine's going to need a LOT more of them.

What does Ukraine REALLY need above more numbers in HIMARS and 155mm howitzers?

Probably some beefier air defenses.  This is very difficult to do. I think the only real solution is to get their guys trained up on PAC-III, and give them a few of those systems.  This would not only help Ukraine to secure their airspace, it would also prevent Russia from launching ballistic and cruise missiles from their territory, because PAC-III would do a very good job shooting those down.  This would also let Ukraine shoot down bombers which are launching cruise missiles from deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine needs to eliminate Russia's ability to attack.

The other KEY thing Ukraine needs is a way to deal with Russia's Black Sea Navy.  They have some good anti-ship missiles now which can push Russias boats back away from the shore, but Russia can still use them to keep Crimea supplied, even if Crimea is cut-off and the bridge destroyed.   Any scenario where Russia keeps Crimea is a Strategic disaster for Ukraine, because it will always be easy for Russia to invade from that location.

Ukraine has a lot going for it, but Russia's got some natural advantages that Ukraine's going to need to deal with one way or another. 

Finally: once Ukraine gets Russia off their territory, they're going to need some way to defend against further invasion, because Russia will not stop trying. No matter what treaty they sign.",False,1654289602.0,t3_v3qtr7,t1_ib2t8gq,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

The Ukranian government seemed to think that it was a bluff from Russia to strangle their economy. It is hard to attract foreign investors if they are convinced that war can break out at any moment. Many western analysts also seemed to think this was the likelier scenario, as a full scale invasion would be a disaster for Russia. Obviously, Ukraine has done a lot better than many expected and Russia has done a lot worse, but I don't think many people believed that Russia would be able to occupy and pacify an enourmous country like Ukraine with their limited amount of soldiers.

Today marks the 100th day since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces failed to achieve their initial objectives to seize Kyiv and Ukrainian centres of government. Staunch Ukrainian resistance and the failure to secure Hostomel airfield in the first 24 hours led to Russian offensive operations being repulsed. Following the failure of the initial plan, through false planning assumptions and poor tactical execution, Russia adapted its operational design to focus on the Donbas. Russia is now achieving tactical success in the Donbas. Russian forces have generated and maintained momentum and currently appear to hold the initiative over Ukrainian opposition. Russia controls over 90% of Luhansk Oblast and is likely to complete control in the next two weeks.  Russia has achieved these recent tactical successes at significant resource cost, and by concentrating force and fires on a single part of the overall campaign. Russia has not been able to generate manoeuvre or movement on other fronts or axes, all of which have transitioned to the defensive. Measured against Russia’s original plan, none of the strategic objectives have been achieved. In order for Russia to achieve any form of success will require continued huge investment of manpower and equipment, and is likely to take considerable further time.

I read similar documents for US municipalities at work and it appears to contain the same sort of subject matter and language I'd expect to see. The word ""sprinkler"" does not appear anywhere in the document, the closest I got was in a throw-away enumeration of what things constitute parts of a ""fire protection system"", and one of those things is ""automatic installations of fire extinguishing"" which seems like it could be a bad translation for ""sprinkler"". Nevertheless if this was an NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) document, they wouldn't beat around the bush in telling you that you need to sprinkler your building, nope, it's literally NFPA 1.

#Beijing chafes at Moscow’s requests for support, Chinese officials say

China’s leadership wants to expand assistance for Russia without running afoul of Western sanctions and has set limits on what it will do

By Cate Cadell and Ellen Nakashima 

Russian officials have raised increasingly frustrated requests for greater support during discussions with Beijing in recent weeks, calling on China to live up to its affirmation of a “no limits” partnership made weeks before the war in Ukraine began. But China’s leadership wants to expand assistance for Russia without running afoul of Western sanctions and has set limits on what it will do, according to Chinese and U.S. officials.

Moscow has on at least two occasions pressed Beijing to offer new forms of economic support — exchanges that one Chinese official described as “tense.” The officials familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

They declined to share specifics of Russia’s requests, but one official said it included maintaining “trade commitments” predating the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and financial and technological support now sanctioned by the United States and other countries.

“China has made clear its position on the situation in Ukraine, and on the illegal sanctions against Russia,” said a person in Beijing with direct knowledge of the discussions. “We understand [Moscow’s] predicament. But we cannot ignore our own situation in this dialogue. China will always act in the best interest of the Chinese people.”

China is in a bind as it seeks to help its most important strategic partner, which started a war that Beijing did not anticipate would now be entering its fourth month, Chinese and U.S. officials said. They said that President Xi Jinping has tasked his closest advisers to come up with ways to help Russia financially but without violating sanctions.

“That has been difficult,” said a senior U.S. official. “And it is insufficient from the Russian standpoint.”

The U.S. official said that China has tried to find “other opportunities” diplomatically, and through joint military exercises, to bolster Russia. Last week, Russia and China flew strategic bombers over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea while President Biden was in Tokyo, wrapping up his first trip to Asia. It was their first joint military exercise since the invasion of Ukraine and a pointed signal of the growing strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing.

“What China is trying to do is to be with Russia, signal neutrality publicly and not be compromised financially,” the U.S. official said. “Many of those goals are contradictory. It’s hard to fulfill them at the same time.”

The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

China has called for an end to the war but has refused to join a global consortium of countries in imposing sanctions on Moscow, instead laying blame for the conflict on the United States and NATO expansion in Europe.

“For a long time, China and Russia have maintained normal cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and energy. The problem is not who will help Russia bypass the sanctions, but that normal economic and trade exchanges between Russia and China have been unnecessarily damaged,” said Liu Pengyu, spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington.

Liu added that the sanctions brought about a “lose-lose” situation for all parties and made “the already difficult world economy worse.”

Beijing’s public support for Russia has not faltered. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to Moscow during a virtual meeting that was also attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Wang said China is willing to work with Russia to promote “real democracy,” alluding to a Chinese foreign policy goal of countering what it has described as U.S. hegemony in global politics.

Russia has not requested “weapons and ammunition” to support its war, the Chinese officials said, but declined to comment on whether Russia had requested other items that could be used in military operations including technology and supplies.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States has not seen any “systematic effort” by China to help Russia evade sanctions, nor has it seen any significant military support from China to Russia.

Blinken, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event commemorating the centennial of Foreign Affairs magazine, noted a “remarkable exodus of companies from Russia” as a result of the invasion — 7,800 companies, Blinken said, that “didn’t want their reputations to be at risk by doing business in Russia.”

The sanctions themselves did not drive the exodus, Blinken said. “It was really companies deciding on their own that they were not going to do business as usual in a country that was committing this kind of aggression. That’s something I think that China also has to factor in as it thinks about its relationship with Russia.”

China has balked at helping Russia evade sanctions, fearing the United States and it allies could cut China off from critical technology, including semiconductors and aerospace equipment, as well as target its financial system, a Beijing official said. Shipments of high-end Chinese technology to Russia — including smartphones, laptops and telecommunications equipment — have plummeted since the war began.

Nonetheless, the Chinese maintain that the U.S. and Western sanctions are illegal and that China will continue to do business with Russia. “The Chinese side is willing to fulfill its commitments to the Russian side, and is doing that when suitable conditions are met,” said the person in Beijing familiar with the discussions.

Asked about U.S. warnings that China would face consequences if it aids Russia, the person said, “The true reason is to sow discord between the Chinese side and the Russian side … that will not happen. They will not succeed in undermining the China-Russian relationship.”

The Chinese official noted, however, that the war in Ukraine had dragged on much longer than expected, and Beijing has made clear to Moscow that an end to the conflict would allow China more leeway to oppose sanctions and grow business ties inside Russia in the wake of the exodus of foreign firms.

Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said, “I think that the hope of the United States and Europe is that China will be forced to choose [between siding with Russia or with the West] and that it will make the right choice. But China has competing interests, and it will be virtually impossible to compel them to place their long-standing support for territorial integrity and sovereignty above their relationship with Russia.”

Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, said “The whole purpose of standing with Russia is they want Russia to work with them in strategic alignment against the U.S.” But by abiding by Western sanctions, after all the public support it has given Russia, Beijing runs the risk of undermining its relationship with Moscow.

A second Chinese official said that discussions among high-level officials have emphasized fast-tracking Russian ventures inside China to cement closer ties while minimizing the risk to Beijing. And open source documents show that Russian-linked projects inside China are forging ahead.

Domestic Chinese bidding documents show that financing for new construction on the strategically significant Russia-China Eastern Route gas pipeline has continued since the war began, with fresh purchases for materials and machinery earmarked for the southern leg of the project. It is expected to provide 18.9 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to China’s economically vibrant Yangtze Delta region by 2025.

China’s Institute of Atomic Energy in April also purchased new services and equipment from Russian nuclear engineering firm OKBM Afrikantov for the Russian-built China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) nuclear project near Beijing, documents show. In the same period, it purchased new supplies and services from Russian state atomic energy firm Rosatom for the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant, a landmark Sino-Russian project under construction in China’s Jiangsu province.

Municipal and provincial governments have also been directed by Beijing to launch projects to expand trade and financial ties with Russia, according to the Beijing officials and domestic bidding documents filed in China.

“Based on the comparative advantages of location and resources, we will analyze the favorable factors and obstacles of regional cooperation between Dalian and the Russian Far East … so as to promote the high-quality economic development,” stated one May 19 document outlining funding for research into investment opportunities in Russia for the northeastern Chinese manufacturing and port hub of Dalian, which is located close to the Russian border.

Chinese officials also said senior leadership had called for new investment and trade with Belarus, which has been targeted with financial and defense sanctions linked to its supporting role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Bidding documents and contracts issued in April and May show Chinese companies continued to make shipments to the China-Belarus Industrial Park, a logistic hub outside Minsk, Belarus, that was created as part of strategic agreement between the two countries. Over half of the companies in the park are financed by China, according to data released in Chinese state media in May.",False,1654236598.0,t3_v3qtr7,t1_ib09d4k,,2,31,0,31,0,0,

Now the big problem isn't even just taking land but to keep it and then to make Ukraine surrender. Crimea is still not recognized as Russian as an example by anyone in the world. So my guess is that Russia will keep trying really hard now to secure the LDPR + land bridge and then find a way out.

Putin is betting on the West giving up before the point where they cannot continue pushing all they can with what they have to demoralize Ukraine and to use the ocuppied land as leverage shall negotiations happen in the hope they are allowed to keep it

Since 12 months ago I am paying more than twice my electricity bill (went from an 80 euros average to more than 220), the gas bill has gone through the roof, groceries cost much more and worst of all interests on my mortgage skyrocketed from 1.05% they were last year to 3.45%, this de facto makes my mortgage payments 50% higher. And the interests keep rising.

I am paying for this war in order of hundreds of euros every month.

They lost Stalingrad because they failed to hold the flanks around the city, which allowed them to be encircled inside the city. The USSR cut off the entire city with a massive armored encirclement employing more than a million men, in an operational-level offensive called Operation Uranus. They spent months moving the forces into position, fooling the Germans into thinking their armor was up north at Moscow, and attacked the Stalingrad salient with a 2-1 advantage in personnel and an overwhelming advantage in tanks.

At Seversdonetsk:

- The Russians are not in a salient that can be cut off

- The Russians outnumber the Ukrainians on the Seversdonetsk Front.

- The Russians are capturing entrenched positions that are more expensive for Ukraine to re-conquer than they would be to defend.

This whole ""trap"" concept is probably not true. It doesn't have to be a grand counteroffensive operation like Uranus, but it has to at least make sense, and it doesn't. Ukraine is incrementally withdrawing from the city block by block because, quite simply, that's the only choice they have if they don't want to lose all the men manning those blocks during each engagement.

The 'ambush' idea suggests that this was a ploy and no retreat was made.

In summary - they’ve stalled. Ukraine, additionally, is actually reporting a 20% pushback in Severodonetsk.

Main Effort—Eastern Ukraine

Subordinate Main Effort—Southern Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk Oblasts (Russian objective: Encircle Ukrainian forces in Eastern Ukraine and capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)

Russian forces conducted limited unsuccessful attacks and continued efforts to resume larger-scale offensives southeast of Izyum towards Slovyansk on June 2. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces focused on maintaining their current positions southeast of Izyum and shelled Dovhenke, Kurulka, Virnopillya, and Dolyna in order to set conditions to renew offensive operations towards Slovyansk.[8] Russian forces additionally conducted unsuccessful assault operations around Studenok, Sosnove, Svyatohirsk, and Yarova, several settlements southeast of Izyum along roadways connecting to the Izyum-Slovyansk highway near the Kharkiv-Donetsk Oblast border.[9] Russian troops likely seek to capture this highway to exploit road access to support advances on Slovyansk. Russian forces in the Lyman reportedly attempted an additional, unsuccessful assault on Raihorodok, northeast of Slovyansk.[10]Russian forces attempting to advance on Slovyansk from both Izyum and Lyman remain largely stalled and are unlikely to make significant progress in the coming days, particularly as the majority of Russian forces continue to focus on Severodonetsk.

Russian forces continued ground assaults in and around Severodonetsk on June 2.[11] Head of the Luhansk People‘s Republic (LNR) Leonid Pasechnik claimed that the LNR controls all of Luhansk Oblast except for Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.[12] Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Department of the Ukrainian General Staff Oleksiy Gromov notably stated that despite Russian efforts to surround Severodonetsk, Ukrainian troops do not need to fully withdraw from the city.[13] Russian forces conducted unsuccessful ground attacks to the south of Severodonetsk-Lysychansk in Bobrove and Ustynivka.[14] The UK Ministry of Defense stated that Russian forces will likely be inhibited in their attempt to advance into Lysychansk from Severodonetsk (if they are first able to capture Severodonetsk itself) due to the tactical challenge of crossing the Siverskyi Donets River.[15] The UK Ministry of Defense additionally noted that Russian forces will likely need a brief tactical pause to prepare for subsequent attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River if they intend further operations into Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts. [16]

Russian forces continued ground, rocket, and artillery strikes around Donetsk Oblast on June 2.[17] Russian forces continued offensive operations to the east of Bakhmut around Komyshuvakha, Mykailivka, Vrubivka, Berestove, Bilohorivka, Svitlodarsk, and Nahirne in order to cut ground lines of communication (GLOCs) northeast of Bakhmut and support continuing but slow-moving operations to encircle Severodonetsk-Lysychansk from the south.[18] The DNR claimed that the Russian grouping in the Donetsk City-Avdiivka area made incremental gains around Avdiivka and reportedly broke through Ukrainian defenses in Verkhnotoreske, though ISW cannot independently confirm this claim.[19]",False,1654295961.0,t3_v3qtr7,t1_ib371yh,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Grapeseed Oil 1L - heat to 180 degrees C on stovetop.

- 4-5 x Carolina Reapers

- Full chunk of Garlic

- Equal amount of Ginger to Garlic

- 1 to 1 1/2 grated Lemon skin.

Put the blitz in a big pyrex bowl.

Carefully pour hot oil into the bowl, slowly.

Let cool, strain out solids to prevent moisture causing mould when stored.

Done.

Outsider's opinion,


Russia is kind of depressing, in how it suffers from an incredible level of government control, to the point of even the church being in on it, while at the same time being run by billionaires who spend as much time outside of Russia as possible.

Meanwhile I can only think of one leader who I don't hate, in well over a hundred years, which was Gorbachev, and the oldsters are disgusted with him for destroying the USSR, while I blame the Kremlin including him for the attempted cover up in the aftermath of Chernobyl.

GDP and purchasing power are both stagnant which comes as a suprise considering the large population and insane amount of natural resources, and the East, which should in theory be opening as the planet heats up, is only connected to the west by either plane or one major railroad, which constantly breaks down due to lack of ability to maintain the whole thing.

.
.
.
.



Russia should be an economic and political powerhouse, but instead is chronically underdeveloped, and languishes under slow moving Authoritarian rule, which has instilled a culture of gaslighting, theft, and suspicion towards outsiders, who are all Nazis apparently.

Fucking Poland went from lagging behind to having more GDP than Russia, and they suffered a massive brain drain that at one point made infrastructure projects near impossible but still did it.

Even the jokes boil down to being about either lying, backwards logic, or ""this could always be worse"".

I don't mean to have a pop at any and all Russian citizens by attempting to call it out, but I see an abusive situation, where you combine a new capitalist state rapidly trying to develop a non-socialist economy

with the less savoury elements of the USSR, such as the constant bullshit, and the use of brute force to suppress everything that might cause issues for the state.
