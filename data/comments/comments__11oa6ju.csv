When in 1993 then-President Boris Yeltsin decided to move against his opposition in the Russian parliament, he used the military to crush it. With the help of the military generals who backed him in his assault on the parliament, Yeltsin dismantled Russian parliamentary democracy and rewrote the constitution to secure presidential authoritarianism.  
>  
>Russia lost the first Chechen War of 1994-1996 due to the Russian army’s weakness and the resilience of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev’s command. Although Russian and international human rights organizations and European Union states condemned Russia’s crimes against humanity, Yeltsin successfully sold the war to the United States as an internal conflict against “banditry.” And in one of its greatest strategic missteps, the United States failed to condemn Yeltsin—with President Bill Clinton instead comparing Yeltsin, incredibly, to Abraham Lincoln fighting the Confederates. Since Clinton’s priority was nuclear arms reduction instead of pushing Russia to comply with international law, as European states advocated, the United States provided financial assistance to Russia instead, partially for denuclearization.  
>  
>A few years later, Vladimir Putin, too, used a war in Chechnya to legitimize and strengthen his personal power. In August 1999 Putin used the pretext of Islamic terrorism to launch the Second Russian-Chechen War. He officially labeled it a “counter-terrorist operation,” which he thought would be short, to raise his own popularity, rising from an unknown political appointee as prime minister to the president of Russia.  
>  
>Although Yeltsin portrayed himself as anti-imperialist and a democrat to the West, he firmly believed in Russians’ regional and global supremacy. While parting with communism, Yeltsin did not part with the vision of Russia’s special global role. Even prior to Ukraine’s independence referendum in 1991, for example, he warned Ukraine that Russia would not make territorial claims only if Ukraine stayed in the union.  
>  
>Putin linked the Chechen sovereignty movement to the idea of a global Islamic threat for Western and domestic audiences, referencing 19th-century Russian tsarist tropes of an unruly Muslim Caucasus that needed to be pacified with violence. These tropes were anchored in the Russian national imagination by writers like Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov.  
>  
>Ever since the second war against Chechnya, which was wildly popular, imperial sentiment proved to be a trusted resource for Putin to make his rule permanent. Today, Putin mixes tsarist imperial references by imagining himself as Peter the Great with communist values by resurrecting the figure of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The mixture makes sense to Russians because it sustains the core Russian national ideology of defensive expansion against external enemies.  
>  
>Dismantling Russia’s imperial mentality is not an impossible or dangerous task. Germany’s path from a destructive colonial dictatorship to democracy was paved with the government’s acceptance of responsibility for wartime atrocities. Germany’s leaders asked for forgiveness, paid reparations to victims of the Holocaust and Nazi forced laborers, built monuments to genocide in the center of Berlin, made Nazi atrocities a core part of school curriculum, and prohibited Nazi propaganda and Holocaust denial.  
>  
>It is for Russia and Russian society, ultimately, to face the atrocities in Ukraine and Chechnya and elsewhere to launch a process of democratization, for the sake of its colonial victims and Russians themselves.

They interviewed a Yale University Professor. So it basically suggests Russia is fucked economically.

* Their national currency is not traded, and so the conversion rate we see when we Google Dollar to Ruble is a fake number. It's BS.
* Their economy is not growing as IMF suggests, that is a canonized number from the Kremlin. It's fake. It's literally what the Kremlin wants us to believe. There are sectors in Russia like the car industry which are not down 10 or 20%, but 99%. Retail, 65%. 2/3rd of the Russian economy comes from energy though, and it is hit hard as well, as shown in the next bullet points.
* Their gas sales to Europe are under 10% while a year ago it was 86%. They can't just sell the difference to China and India, as they don't have the pipes for it. All the while Europe has built LNG terminals in Germany (in record tempo) and can import from multiple countries around the world (USA, Norway, Algeria, etc.).  
* The crude oil from Russia is much more costly to extract than the oil from the Saudis, for example. Around 45 Dollars per barrel and up to 12 Dollars to ship. As G7 capped Russian oil at 60 Dollars, this is not making them as much money as people might think.
* Not from the video above, but from another video from Joe Blogs, I know that Europe also stopped buying refined oil products, like kerosene, diesel, benzene, etc. Unlike crude oil, India and China are not so much interested in those as they have their own refineries, which also provide jobs for their economy. I saw data suggesting Europe bought tens of millions of Euros of it each day.
* Russia is eating into the foreign currency reserves they have, and 1 oligarch (Deripaska) already predicted that Russia has no money anymore in 2024.

Time is not on their side. Once they run out of money, the price of basic goods will skyrocket, as will unemployment.

> [*West*]  The enemy presses powerfully on Ivanivsky’s east side, in order just to bypass the village and get to T0504.

> *South* counter-attacks by us; there are small tactical successes after our counterattacks.

> *North*: the situation is very difficult. The enemy simultaneously expands the northern flank to the west, attacks Bohdanivka and tries to bypass Khromove from the east.  The battles are very difficult. Ours are holding on. 

> [*West*] To the east and south of Ivanivsky, battles just as fierce. South of the village, the situation is more or less stabilized; on its east side, **fighting wages right next to the T0504 highway.**

> Fighting continues north of Soledar, but everything is under control. 

> The *southern* outskirts of Bakhmut: counter battles take place. 

> The *general situation*: over the last day, the enemy has significantly increased the pressure east of Ivanivsky, in order not only to reach the T0504 route, but also to cut it and control it in the area of the same ""aircraft"", which has already been destroyed. In fact, the **route has not been useable for more than a week** and alternative routes are being used. But being left with a narrow supply bottleneck is extremely dangerous. 

> There are certain actions on our part that can improve the situation. Let's see. But for now, it is what it is.

KYIV, March 10 (Reuters) - Ukraine has decided to fight on in the ruined city of Bakhmut because the battle is pinning down Russia's best units and degrading them ahead of a planned Ukrainian spring counter-offensive, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.

The comments by Mykhailo Podolyak were the latest signal of a shift by Kyiv continue the defence of the small eastern city, site of the war's bloodiest battle, as Moscow tries to secure its first major victory in more than half a year.

""Russia has changed tactics,"" Podolyak said in an interview published by Italy's La Stampa newspaper. ""It has converged on Bakhmut with a large part of its trained military personnel, the remnants of its professional army, as well as the private companies.""

""We, therefore, have two objectives: to reduce their capable personnel as much as possible, and to fix them in a few key wearisome battles, to disrupt their offensive and concentrate our resources elsewhere, for the spring counter-offensive.

> [*South—stable:*]: Along the southern outskirts of Bakhmut, the situation there is more or less under control. Skirmishes without either side advancing.

>Russian law requires individuals and organizations that are determined to have received foreign funding and to have engaged in loosely defined “political activity” to identify themselves as “foreign agents.”

>The label brings additional government scrutiny. It also carries a strong pejorative connotation in Russia. Authorities have used the law to discredit those listed and to stifle dissent.

They admitted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was ""wrong,"" but just kind of pushed that aside.

... Yet they still ""don't want any of their tax dollars going to help Ukraine"" as though ignoring the broader implications of a protracted war. They bought into the literal Russian propaganda (peddled in part by conservative media) that ""NATO encroached on Russia Federation"" when they did no such thing. They confuse Baltic states of the former USSR but forget Russia had their own Warsaw Pact and would continue to do the same if they had anything to offer. Now Russia can't offer deals; they can only intimidate with their economy skewed to their shitty military. 

They seem to lack the foresight that if Ukraine falls, that undermines the security of many NATO alliances and increases the odds that they themselves would have to fight, just as Zelenskyy noted in his conference. 

It's like they're always late to the party. I remember trying to drill into heads of conservatives that Iraq was wrong. It's like after finally learning the lessons of Iraq they took that lesson and over-applied it to everything without seeing any nuance whatsoever.

For better or worse, we've made it clear that anything they do in Ukraine is fair game so long as they don't use WMDs. They're certainly not taking defensive measures to protect themselves from NATO strikes.

Really, they're just riding on nuclear deterrence knowing the ball is in their hands.

Setting aside the drama with Arestovych, before the invasion he aptly said if Russia cannot have Ukraine, they'd settle for destroying so much as to degrade the economic and military viability of Ukraine's partnership with the west.

It is ***not*** *Russian incompetence*.  This person is just parroting Russian propaganda.  The cause of what he’s describing is **Russian evil manipulation: Russians attack the infrastructure on the territory they currently hold**, as a multi-faceted **campaign to destroy life** in the Donbas and make those people **wholly dependent on Russia**.  

Ukrainians *do* ***not*** *target* the infrastructure, nor do they fire adjacent to it.
Ukraine gets its long-range coordinates from (or in coordination with) NATO. NATO abides by Geneva and absolutely would not provide coordinates to facilities which are adjacent to infrastructure.  Even where Ukraine finds its own coordinates, NATO watches, observes.  If they saw this happening, the funding would quickly dry up. 

One **example** of Russia destroying infrastructure, then claiming Ukraine did it—is the **supply of water** to Luhansk and Donetsk. It’s very complicated and gets into all sorts of ecology, geography and engineering, but basically, the Russians destroyed that areas ability to get water.  So now, water is being diverted from Russia—to the ire of the local farmers—while a multibillion-ruble canal and new treatment centers are being built.

All the while, telling the population over and over and over and over and over and over that Ukraine destroyed the water system (canals, reservoirs, towers, treatment plants, etc.) that, in fact, the Russians destroyed. 

The articles I have on this are quite academic, their over the heads of the general readers, so I never posted them.  Or they’re Russian (locals complaining) and we can’t post from there.

The Russians have done this with every element of public works—water, gas, electricity, communications—and they tell their domestic audience that this is why the Donbas needs to be rescued.  They tell the Ukrainians it was cause by Ukrainian Armed Forces and they’re here to save them. 

**The only thing that quote did is prove that Russian propaganda is effective—that blogger believes it.**

Again, despite the Russians hiding their equipment in nuclear power plants, adjacent to substations or treatment plants, in between civilian apartment blocks or homes—the Ukrainians do not retaliate when that equipment is near infrastructure or civilians.  That is propaganda.
They wait for it to be trotted out.  Just like the tanks.  Or sorry, do we have photos of tanks burned to bits adjacent to towers or amongst homes?  Never.  Only in fields or on roads or paths.

______

Edit: I want to give two other reasons this is false.  One is that the majority of the destroyed infrastructure was done during the 2014-2022 period.  CIA and contracted former special ops were doing some training *on site* in Eastern Ukraine then—this was disclosed in 2022, when yaho o first published it; and subsequently, when DOD asked whether any remained, disclosed that they all were supposed to get out when embassy had closed.   CIA and special ops know this isn’t allowed, that it’s a war crime.  They absolutely would have reported it back to command.

Second—and this wasn’t reported by western press—but a general made a grave mistake in March or April last year and was promptly removed, put on desk duty—by Zelensky, personally, within 24hrs.  The General who commanded the Eastern Forces was removed last year, sent to Kyiv to do administrative job of ensuring the procurement and instalment of the fortification of Kyiv, despite the announcement that the city was already fortified.  Basically, desk work.  What happened was he intercepted a missile launched over Donetsk (Oblast), but the debris fell on downtown Donetsk (city).  About 10 people were killed.  There were gruesome videos.  Bc it was very powerful and had a shock wave. In his defense, he didn’t launch, only intercepted.  That wasn’t good enough for Zelensky.  The rule is to take into consideration the debris field, so as to avoid civilian casualties as much as possible. Can calculate the zone of where will fall.  Zelensky didn’t care that the victims were a bunch of zombified, ussr -loving pensioners who hate Ukraine, the General has a duty to ensure they weren’t killed regardless of their loyalties and he failed.",1678570406.0,1678568834.0,t3_11oa6ju,t1_jbu5bdn,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Now we know that they've done this prematurely, and so they have to bust their balls to make it happen. This makes them simple-minded and predictable. There's literally no other objective that is more important on everyone's todo list.

At the same time, every day Bahkmut holds is another day people can see that their bragging is just hot air.

- Even if Kofmans points were surprisingly at odds with the sentiment we see on this sub, his conclusions may be inaccurate. 
- We don’t know what misinformation strategies are being used. Perhaps the constant calls for withdrawal and/or the very public decision to hold the city is meant to draw Russia into more bad decisions, whether thats to push into the city, or to continue flanks. 
- We don’t actually know the size of the forces currently used to hold the city, and where/how they are doing that.
- If Ukraine does withdraw, it sounds like they will immediately be in favorable defensive positions and Russia would struggle to hold the city.

So perhaps that is already basically the situation… a rear guard which is smaller than these bloggers report holding the city, with fortified defenses awaiting their withdrawal, and over-extended flanks and extended supply lines becoming targets for counterattacks? I have no idea, but I don’t think any of the bloggers can really know (they came close to the city, but weren’t actually at the front). It is not an obvious situation and I personally suspect, or at least hope, that the military leadership is getting really great strategic advice and making very smart decisions on the ground.

Something to be aware of is that some militaries and governments may reclassify groups of people, such as civilians, to make their figures look better and more acceptable to the general public.  

This is purely a made up example to illustrate what I mean:  

Rather than report X number of children were killed in a war and risk outrage at home, they may classify any civilian male from the age of 13 as an armed adult enemy soldier.  

That not only inflates the figures but also hides the true nature of the war from the public.  

As far as Russia is concerned, we know Russia is brutally killing civilians. I've no idea if they reclassify them similar to the above example or if the figures are as inflated as Putin's election results.  

One problem with this war compared to the first Chechen war is that large portions of the Russian public will never know the truth.

Even if you want to only count vehicles you can confirm 100%, there are things like aircraft and artillery that are often ""destroyed"" miles behind the line and you have to decide by analyzing damage via drone footage. The numbers of destroyed aircraft and artillery reported would probably not be possible with such a strict methodology.

Here's a [brief overview from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Certain_Conventional_Weapons#Protocol_III:_Incendiary_Weapons):  
>Protocol III on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons prohibits, in all circumstances, making the civilian population as such, individual civilians or civilian objects, the object of attack by any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat or a combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target. The protocol also prohibits the use of air-delivered incendiary weapons against military targets within a concentration of civilians, and limits the use of incendiary weapons delivered by other means. Forest and other plants may not be a target unless they are used to conceal combatants or other military objectives.[2][9] Protocol III lists certain munition types like smoke shells which only have a secondary or additional incendiary effect; these munition types are not considered to be incendiary weapons.[10]",False,1678588092.0,t3_11oa6ju,t1_jbvobdv,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

If Mexico had gotten to the point where they need Russian weapons, that means the US had somehow lost diplomatic and economic leverage. The best answer to this is to provide other incentives. Better trade deals, better diplomatic and government relations and cooperation, solving problems that affect both countries, etc.

My point is, if Mexico is setting up Russian missiles on the US border, it means that the US screwed something up in their relations with Mexico so incredibly absurdly that Mexico felt they needed that deterrent.

That possibility simply doesn't make sense: don't reveal your hand. 

Bahkmut seems to have eaten an entire Russian PWC group, for example. That's a terrible cost to Russia, in many complex ways: politically, resource-wise and in reputation. It's hard to put a price on that. We don't know the price Ukraine is paying, but again I'm sure they are exaggerating not playing down the difficulty, because if there purpose is tying down and eliminating Russian forces then you want them to keep trying. 

The price, as you say, is wildly asymmetrical, with many intangible components on each side. However one thing we can conclude is that those intangibles are mostly good for Ukraine — morale, force projection, causing chaos in the enemy ranks; but from Russia's position are solidly terrible: depletion, infighting, blame, shame, powerlessness, loss of respect, paralysis.

For one thing whilst Russia is destroying Bakhmut they aren't destroying towns further into Ukraine so continuing to fight there protects people behind the current front. But the main thing is that there are reports Russia is critically weakening its entire front line right now in the effort to take Bakhmut. Ukraine appears to be holding it without fully committing its reserves leaving it in position to strike at will wherever they believe they can break through. If Russia finally takes Bakhmut in a month only to have the front line collapse in the north and/or south then Ukraine still wins. Russia is focused on 1 battle. Ukraine and it's allies are focused on the war.

Logistical because of how much personnel and materiel is required to hold Bakhmut. Does this put the approaching counteroffensive in Spring at risk if Ukraine cannot reconstitute their forces in time?

Political because holding Bakhmut is costing many lives, and the routes out of the city are still at risk from attack.

Reinforcing now is a risk but may pay dividends. I recognize that just because they are deploying good troops to Bakhmut doesn't mean the wholesale loss of western trained troops. 

But we're not blind either and there have been some very prominent voices who support Ukraine who have been leery of defending Bakhmut from the jump. And while it was easy to dismiss them before, we're really getting to the point where the rubber hits the road on this question. Ukraine is clear that Russia is throwing everything at Bakhmut and while the numbers favor Ukraine in terms of losses, losing a western trained troop is not necessarily worth 10 Russian Mobiks. Ukraine situation is not improving in Bakhmut so it's hard to see the pay off here.

Time will tell but Ukraine is not doing a good job of communicating the benefits of this approach.

Another way to think of this is to ask, how far did the glider travel forward for every foot it dropped in altitude? Usually the glide ration is higher then 1:1, which is important in this case. 

Trying to add more kinetic energy (to increase range) by traveling faster comes with a huge penalty, velocity squared. In simple words, to double the speed you need four times the energy. 

Add height instead? And a glide ratio of 1:3 will triple your range with the same amount of energy. In other words, it’s very beneficial to trade speed with height. Speed comes with a squared penalty, while added height gives you x3 range in return.

There is nothing to indicate they are, and Ukraine has been quite open about how much it limits their ability to operate.

>So one tactic would be you fly in at 200 feet, you pop up to 2,000 feet, drop the bomb and then head back to 200 feet. The Russians see you for a minute and maybe launch a missile, but the missile cant track you once you are back at 200 feet

Most SAM missiles have their own guidance systems, going to 200 feet isn't going to interfere with a missile that's got a target lock. 

>Another tactic would be to have 4 jets, two flying in low and ahead and fire anti - radar missiles forcing the Russians to turn off their AA radar and then have 2 jets come into range flying very high and fast and drop the JDAMs and then turn and drop to the deck before the Russians can turn back on their radar and shoot.
