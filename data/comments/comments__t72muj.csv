Russian forces have continued to bombard cities and other sites across Ukraine, launching missiles and artillery attacks. A vast Russian convoy, which is thought to be 40 miles long, remains stalled outside Kyiv, according to Associated Press.

The mayor of Mariupol, a strategic port city that has been subject to heavy Russian attacks, said the city has been “blockaded” by Russian forces. Mayor Vadym Boychenko has previously warned the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are running out. He has appealed for military assistance and for a humanitarian corridor.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy strongly criticised Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”. Zelenskiy will address the US Senate on Saturday during a Zoom call that is scheduled for 9.30am Eastern Time.

The US Embassy in Ukraine described Russia’s attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, as a war crime, stating: “Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further.” Russia blamed a “Ukrainian sabotage group” for the fire at the plant.

Major news organisations including the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, CBS News and the Canadian Broadcasting Company have suspended reporting inside Russia, after it imposed a law that threatens jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news” about the war in Ukraine.

Russia has also blocked Facebook, Twitter and the websites of the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Voice of America, in an attempt to control the flow of information and stamp out independent media coverage.

Several leading luxury brands said they will temporarily close stores and halt business operations in Russia. This includes Hermes, the Cartier owner Richemont, LVMH, Kering and Chanel, announced they will temporarily close stores and halt business operations in Russia. Samsung has also suspended shipments, after Microsoft and Apple announced similar measures.

A company spokesperson said PayPal will support withdrawals “for a period of time, ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations.

And, after all, you are fighting to convet that land, to turn it into liveable area for which you need both people and infrastructure. Let's take Mauripol as an example, when you destroy the port, the powerplant, the main infrastructure, and send the people fleeing, what was the point? You now own an empty shell where nothing works. If there is no power, water or food in the city, you can't use it as a staging ground or command post either. And you need a large (if not happy then at least calm) populace for that.

Be it lack of air superiority, lack of guided bombs, logistical quagmires, rusting equipment, poorly trained soldiers, commanders taking poor decisions, elite units getting killed in droves, etc.

This fact will not have gone unnoticed among NATO and Western strategists, and leaders. The supposedly mighty Russian military looks like a paper beast right now.

I guess I wonder if this could ever make Russia more dangerous in the long-run - as they will also be fully conscious that their military image has been irrevocably damaged? And as much as they love to project that they don't care about the west and don't fear it - behind closed bunker doors I imagine they do, and they're feeling exposed as being several notches less powerful than NATO, and probably somewhat less than a few of NATO's individual members (thank god for Nukes, eh Vlad?). 

Then again, I doubt they will have the financial capacity to do any kind of military rebuild in order to modernise and professionalise anyway. They'll be ruined by then.

Associated Press reports:

Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee, declared his horror at the fighting in Ukraine and called on world authorities to promote peace.

“Tonight, I want, I must begin with a message of peace,” Parsons said in brief remarks to the athletes and spectators at the Bird’s Nest stadium. “As the leader of an organization with inclusion at its core, where diversity is celebrated and differences embraced, I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now.

Paralympic organizers had initially said that Russians and Belarusians would be allowed to compete in Beijing, but later reversed the decision.

AP adds:

The live broadcast of the opening on Chinese state TV did not translate Parsons’ condemnation of war and and then lowered the volume of his remarks in English for a while. The Chinese government has been restricting anti-Russia views in state media and online. Unlike the US and Europe, it has not criticized the invasion and opposed sanctions on Russia.

The 17 signatories to the appeal include the Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, a Belarusian author who writes in Russian. She won the Nobel prize for literature in 2015 for writing described as “a monument to courage and suffering in our time”.

Another dozen distinguished authors from around the world, including the Nobel laureate JM Coetzee, have backed the appeal.

It comes as the Russian government cracked down on access to news and information about the invasion of Ukraine by blocking websites and effectively closing broadcast outlets.

It's kind of a murky area but it seems like his approval ratings have stayed pretty constant around 75%.  I'm not going to debate the legitimacy of these as I think most of us know the answer.  However, those who are followers of Russian state-media would be none the wiser and that's all he really cares about.

Essentially, he could have put the army on the border of Ukraine, threatened them with his big scary force and then backed off.  Done a couple of appearances about it on state TV to make him out better than what actually happened and Russia would have been completely fine.  He's already President until 2036 or some crazy time like that.  All he had to do is have his advisors and representatives go to these UN meetings, fake being angry about something, threatening to do something, and we as the West would try and settle him down and be like ""okay woah, woah, let's try and talk this out.""

Then he goes back to TV touts it as a victory against the evil West and the US and makes another $100 million that day or whatever it is he gets.  He could of had the easiest job in existence, greatly increased his wealth, retired or died as a somewhat respectable leader to Russia that brought it back from the brink of collapse and reestablished some of its old territory.  Let's be honest, the West didn't give two shits about Crimea or the territory disputes in Donbas region that have been ongoing.  This was their line of no return and his hubris made him cross it.

""July 2006 – A few days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin walked from the Big Kremlin Palace to his Residence. At one of the Kremlin squares, the president stopped to chat with the tourists. Among them was a boy aged 4 or 5. What is your name?’ Putin asked. ‘Nikita,’ the boy replied. Putin kneeled, lifted the boy’s T-shirt and kissed his stomach. The world public is shocked. Nobody can understand why the Russian president did such a strange thing as kissing the stomach of an unfamiliar small boy. The explanation may be found if we look carefully at the so-called “blank spots” in Putin’s biography.

After graduating from the Andropov Institute, which prepares officers for the KGB intelligence service, Putin was not accepted into the foreign intelligence. Instead, he was sent to a junior position in KGB Leningrad Directorate. This was a very unusual twist for a career of an Andropov Institute’s graduate with fluent German. Why did that happen with Putin? Because, shortly before his graduation, his bosses learned that Putin was a pedophile. So say some people who knew Putin as a student at the Institute.

The Institute officials feared to report this to their own superiors, which would cause an unpleasant investigation. They decided it was easier just to avoid sending Putin abroad under some pretext. Such a solution is not unusual for the secret services. Many years later, when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for presidency, he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him by the secret services over earlier years. It was not difficult, provided he himself was the FSB director. Among other things, Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security Directorate, which showed him making sex with some underage boys. Interestingly, the video was recorded in the same conspiratorial flat in Polyanka Street in Moscow where Russian Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov was secretly video-taped with two prostitutes. Later, in the famous scandal, Putin (on Roman Abramovich’s instructions) blackmailed Skuratov with these tapes and tried to persuade the Prosecutor-General to resign. In that conversation, Putin mentioned to Skuratov that he himself was also secretly video-taped making sex at the same bed. (But of course, he did not tell it was pedophilia rather than normal sex. Later, Skuratov wrote about this in his book Variant Drakona (p.p. 153-154).""",False,1646462199.0,t3_t72muj,t3_t72muj,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

Similarly, US and Ukraine are certainly very closely communicating. I'm sure the USA (and allies) understand that Zelensky has to say certain things that the Ukrainian people want to hear. If his people are angry about NFZ not happening then he needs to be pissed off too. It's very important that they feel in sync with their leader.

Here is PA’s summary of the interview:

Johnson said he believes Putin intends to “double down” on his invasion of Ukraine, as the Russian president envisages “no way out” but to “continue with the destruction”.

Johnson recounted his overnight call with Zelenskiy about the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia power station, saying their pair agreed that an attack on a nuclear power plant is “clearly a matter of our common European health and safety”.

“Our security is equally involved, equally jeopardised by such an attack,” he said. “We remember what happened with Chernobyl, the radioactive clouds spread over the whole continent, and indeed, also to North America, as far as I can remember.

“There is clearly a risk... I am concerned about how we stop a disaster: there are other Ukrainian plants and there are certainly other Ukrainian radioactive nuclear waste sites.”

On how nuclear plants can be protected, he said: “We have to make clear to the Kremlin that a civilian nuclear disaster in Ukraine, another Chernobyl, is a disaster for Russia as well as for everybody.”

“Therefore, I think that some system of protecting those plants, some system of ensuring that radioactivity levels are monitored by international authorities, such as the UN (United Nations) and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) on the ground, is going to be extremely important.”

* Any concessions he gets from Ukraine beyond that (such as ""neutrality"") will be extra.
* In exchange for withdrawal from all other areas, Europe will probably ease sanctions.
* He needs 2-3 years to rebuild his army.

This assumes he is not insane. At this point he's pressing to see how far he can get, but he will not and cannot occupy Ukraine, especially Kiev or Lviv, for a long time. He will continue until he decapitates the gov't or runs out of fuel.

I have two questions. How likely do you think this is and second, if you are a citizen of a NATO country, how do you feel about risking nuclear war to defend these countries?

Read everything before taking action. 

The **resistance** in Russia needs help from people OUTSIDE Russia - if they themselves post anything on social media about the war they can now get 15 years in prison! There is a cry for help by well informed, especially young Russians who want to protest the war to spread information of when protests are taking place! **To protest most safely they depend on the safety of numbers!** 

This is a very real and alive resistance movement boiling underneath the Russian state and state controlled propaganda. Earlier this week, the already imprisoned opposition leader, Alexey Navalny has called for protests on Twitter where he addressed the Russian people - and he was specific about time. The places below are the  main squares for protets he also suggested. 

THE MAIN PROTEST IS ON SUNDAY AT 14:00 (2 PM). Time is now of the essence!

IMPORTANT:
You need to use creative ways to get through to Russians as Facebook, Twitter and many other websites have now been suspended. 

- Use Russian groups on Telegram, underground groups in Russia are also known to use these. 
- Use sites like TripAdvisor.ru and pick random places in cities you can find on Google Maps and spread information via reviews. 
- You can use Instagram and WhatsApp as these are still not banned in Russia, but the message needs to reach Russians in Russian. 
- If you are aware of other sites still **that allow posting** in Russia please suggest these - Google translate can be used to translate an entire Russian site into English. 

English translation of message:

Protest the war! Saturday at 14:00. Do not let fear be greater than your conscience. Save lives and our future. Spread the word!

Exhausted in terms of combat effectiveness. What follows next I don’t know. Maybe a ceasefire where both sides reorganize and resupply, maybe a settlement. It depends on the course of the war and the situation in Russia. End.

That’s not indicative of either side winning, or the war ending. I can’t predict how the next few weeks will go. Just looking at it from my limited perspective, I see this phase of it as bounded, especially given how the war began.

- India is NOT supporting Russia. We have taken a neutral stance because if we don't, we don't get fertilizer or defense equipment from Russia, so then we either die of hunger or we die because of our neighbors. India has provided a lot of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. 

- It's sad that a lot of people in this comment section are unaware of the practical and legitimate problems that are faced by Third World countries like India. Unlike the USA, where supporting Russia or not is a matter of ethics or doing the right thing, for India it's literally a matter of having food to eat at the end of the day. We don't have the luxury of getting a choice in this matter. 

- I might get downvoted for this, but I have observed that Americans seem to have a very black and white view of situations like these. For them, you're either with us or against us, no in-between. Americans have rarely fought their wars on their own land, so they don't know what it's like to be in a situation like that, where you don't know if you'll survive tomorrow or have food for tonight. For Indians right now, this is a do or die situation. We don't want war or Ukrainians to die, but all of us also don't have the luxury of eating 3 square meals a day, so we really do need to stay neutral to survive.",1646461944.0,1646461813.0,t3_t72muj,t3_t72muj,,0,9,0,9,2,0,

Edit: to the rhetoric of playing chicken with Putin - I meant at the start of this before he attacked, but yeah sure hindsight is nice. But also you realise that he is taking Ukraine and then what we just sit and sanction still and push Russia into a pariah state like North Korea, maybe a civil war breaks out but that’s an extremely unlikely scenario in my opinion.

&#x200B;

\- Ukraine holds out longer than anyone expected, however, eventually Kyiv falls to Russia in a few months. 

\- Russia installs a puppet government in Ukraine, much to the outage of most Ukrainians. 

\- Russia keeps Donbas, Luhansk, Crimea. They now are able to get water to Crimea and keep the oil reserves off the coast.

\- Russia pulls out most soldiers and claim they accomplished their goal of denazifying Ukraine. 

\- Constant protests / civil unrest against the new Ukrainian government. Russia needs to basically occupy Ukraine to keep their puppet government from being overthrown. Probably a lot of media outrage here of Russians breaking up protests, assaulting protestors, etc.

\- Russia occupation of Ukraine is nearly impossible and expensive because it's so unpopular with the people; it's bleeding Russia dead. 

\- Sanctions are not lifted on Russia. Their economy is fucked. While oligarchs and Putin are ok, the average Russian citizen has an enormous downgrade to their life. 

\- Nearby countries (Moldova, Finland, etc) increase defense spending and work towards joining NATO/EU. Russia publicly states that's ""crossing a line"", but they really can't do shit about it because they're broke from the sanctions and the war. 

\- Russia is basically reliant on China at this point; China exploits the shit out of Russia for cheap energy since no other major economy is willing to do business with Russia. 

&#x200B;

In the end, literally everyone except Putin and China is worse off:

\- Thousands of Ukrainian citizens are dead. 

\- Thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers are dead. 

\- The average Ukrainian civilian is much worse off, being run by a puppet government and having much of their infrastructure destroyed. 

\- The average Russian civilian is much worse off. Their economy is fucked, their currency crashed, inflation runs rampant.

\- Putin is better off - he gets his dream of conquering Ukraine and he's still a billionaire.

\- Russian oligarchs are worse off, but that basically means their net worth went from 5B to 2B. They're still billionaires so it really doesn't matter to them. 

\- China is better off. They can exploit Russia in trade bc they know Russia is dependent on them. So they buy Russian oil/gas for pennies on the dollar. 

\- The US is more or less neutral. Although sanctions do hurt the US economy slightly, this war also helped unite the west and help the US grow closer to EU.",False,1646460498.0,t3_t72muj,t3_t72muj,,0,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Ideally to shoot each other and dispose of both. But we do not need another Hungary or Turkey in the western alliance.

*It would also be helpful for Putin to understand that the West WILL NOT ACCEPT a Ukraine dominated by Azov*. We should reject that possibility clearly and outright.

Downvotes to this post should be taken as either Russian or Ukrainian nazism; I expect a lot, but this is the middle ground and the overarching view of the situation which should make sense to anyone in the EU or in America.

Their current army N of Kyiv is just not enough. Even if they attempted it, they'd be vulnerable to attacks from the surrounding regions. They won't start sieging Kyiv before the Ukrainian forces in Donbas are dealt with and Kharkiv is taken.

These people are standing in front of rows of guns because their love of freedom and willingness to stand up for whats right outweighs the obvious risks in their eyes. People talk about the end of the world, well the world would end for any of those protestors if one russian soldier pulls a trigger.

Meanwhile NATO, with its huge advanced airforce, with a nuclear deterrent which would make any russian use of nuclear weapons mutual suicide, can't protect the air above Ukraine because..'the risks are too great'.

The whole point of the west having nuclear weapons of its own is so it can protect its allies and not be intimidated by threats of nuclear blackmail.

The new paradigm simply cannot be that a state with nuclear weapons can commit any atrocity or any outrage with no threat of military response. If that is the case, then every non aligned country in the world would be well advised to start its own nuclear program. The West spent decades trying to encourage smaller countries to give up their own nuclear programs, but why? If Taiwan, or Ukraine, or Sweden, or Israel or Vietnam or the Philippines or any other country at risk from nuclear powers can't rely on western protection if the attacker is a nuclear power, plainly the only way to guarantee your safety is a domestic nuclear program. 

Yes there are risks of any military confrontation spiralling out of control but those are risks that can be managed, bearing in mind Russia has every reason to want to avoid a nuclear war.

However, I should also point that other intelligence suggested Russia planned this war for about a year in advance and was expecting total control of Ukraine within about 2 weeks. Mind you, that would require Russia to conquer the major cities, esp Kyiv, within the first few days, which they obviously haven't managed to do yet. Plus, it seems they heavily underestimated international sanctions and Ukrainian resistance, let alone take into account literal guerilla warfare breaking out after they managed to install a puppet regime (Ukrainians seem hell bent on fighting the invader and keeping their freedom), so I would be surprised if any of their old plans still apply even remotely.

""Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.""

"" The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.""

""Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".",False,1646464048.0,t3_t72muj,t1_hzf4947,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Prices would increase world wide and Putin could sell to the remaining buyers at an even higher price point than if there wasn't a ban by Western nations. Meanwhile, European allies would struggle to get the logistics in place to maintain their countries if Russian oil was suddenly cut off.

TLDR captured SAM thingy means they can hack the IFF codes and track Russian aircraft.

https://chicagoboyz.net/archives/67311.html#comment-1054903

Vis-a-vis those tires on that Pantsir…

That’s a very high-value weapons system. As in, ‘effing vital to your air defense umbrella.

If you’re not making sure that that vehicle has good tires on it, what are you prioritizing?

The fact that one of those, apparently intact, is sitting out there for some Ukrainian farmer to make off with…? That’s flatly terrifying to whoever is running that ADA umbrella, for oh-so-many reasons. First, the system is now unavailable. Second, and probably most important, the COMSEC and IFF data may still be on that thing, intact. That means that Ukraine now has a means of getting inside the Russian ADA networks, and wreaking havoc on anything flying. Hell, with the right guy doing the hacking, I wouldn’t doubt that they couldn’t get in and change IFF id codes such that Russian aircraft were now identified as hostile across the network, which would be ‘effing incredible–They’d be able to watch as the Russian ADA shot down their own aircraft.

If any vehicle was a burnt-out hulk, it should have been that one. Dear God, the freakin’ potential there in terms of just COMSEC having to be redone across the entire force, based on the presumption it’s been compromised. I would lay you long odds that whoever abandoned that thing intact that way probably didn’t “Z” out all the systems…

This is, by the way, an SF teams fantasy accomplishment: Capturing something as networked as this thing is, intact. The fact that it’s sitting there on Twitter? Russian COMSEC security guys should be filling their pants, right about now, and so should the ADA bubbas.

I cannot emphasize enough what a big deal an intact Pantsir with its COMSEC and IFF would be, to the right people. If the Ukrainians can’t take advantage of something like that falling into their laps? They deserve to lose, frankly.

That picture caused literal jaw drop, when I saw it. The implications, past the tires? LOL… Mind-boggling. That’s galactic-level military incompetence, that is. You do not abandon or allow to be abandoned an asset like that.

Again, it doesn't make invading another country right, but resisting/ armed civillians are no civillians, but irregulars. According to the Geneva convention they can be treated even worse than soldiers, without it being a considered a crime.

Biogas created from human waste. Seriously, it can work.

“The financial value of biogas potentially generated exceeds US$200 million per year and could reach as high as US$376 million. The energy value would equal that of the fuel needed to generate electricity for 10 million to 18 million local households. Processing the residual faecal sludge, meanwhile, would yield the equivalent of 4.8 million to 8.5 million tonnes of charcoal to help power industrial furnaces, for example.”

A vast majority of Americans distrust Putin and Russia (\~80% bipartisan opinion). For now, a majority also want to stop using Russian oil and gas. So, a lot of people do not support the war in Ukraine.

I think the Republicans are keen to what will be a good message in the upcoming November elections. They are not so hyper-focused on Russia for moral reasons, but I think they are desperate not to be painted by the Democrats as being extreme. They realize that this will be a strong counter message if they look unruly. They want to run on high gas prices (which this conflict will surely help) and high inflation and the lack of major legislation passed (because of their obstruction). 

There are people who support Putin and Russia because of what they see as being in line with their largely white-nationalist views on the world. I think that this is pretty much synonymous with the extreme parts of the Republican wing. I'm hoping that the moderates in the Republicans are viewing this as a chance to break away from Putin's meddling in US affairs, but I can't rule out that they're just playing politics in line with what is above. Still, I hope this is genuine bipartisanship and not some short-sighted political gain.  If it is bipartisan, then I look forward to a reckoning of people like Marco Rubio and Mitch McConnell not convicting Trump in light of his efforts to help Russia. I also hope that a serious rebuke of Rand Paul happens as he is in Russia's pocket (according to reports) and has filibustered legislation in support of Ukraine.

So taking things back to the first few things in your tree.. I think you're vastly overestimating how many more casualties the russian military can sustain and how much longer their economy can keep this up.

My prediction of the coming month: Russian casualties and equipment losses determine the war. The focus of the Ukrainians is currently in the north around Kyiv. I think they seriously intend to break the russian forces in this area in the coming days, begin to encircle the convoy, and start picking off the AA with anti-materiel snipers and javelins and such. The other vehicles in the convoy will be unable to fight due the mud and lack of supplies, and with the AA dealt with the droning begins. Casualtirs could be enormous, but also prisoners and defections as the russians don't wait to be picked off in their vehicles, and either flee north or surrender rather than risk starving or being shot. Or, if the ukrainians manage an encirclement of the stuck convoy, that will be more casualties, fewer desertions, and more POWs

Ukraine will likely then turn their army south to deal with the stuff they've been mostly ignoring so far. Russia will have its gains reversed in the south, and forces in cities that were subjected to war crimes will be dealt with savagely, unlike the good treatment of POWs who surrendered early or before reaching cities. Russia will probably have carried out multiple escalations of bombing intensity by this point, so the bloodlust will be high. 

I'm guessing by this point, in early april, the russians will be in a total panic and ready to sue for peace.",False,1646462008.0,t3_t72muj,t1_hzf6joa,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

I will dissent from your opinion. Your statement is a great way to plant some long term seeds of doubt. So lets analyze the situation a little more. 

Ukrainians are not just 'holding out' they have thoroughly rebuked, defended, and displaced many Putin's war objectives. We see Ukrainian's even projecting attacks into Putin's territory, reference the Millerovo air base attack. The leaked plans tell us a story of 15 days. Most of those being taking and holding key positions including Kyiv by now. At present they have lost much more than they planned, the major advancements have been either MAJORLY slowed or halted, and overall the Ukrainians have not shown the bulk of their military forces. To date we have seen skirmishes of small groups from Ukrainians, use of projected force, and small man operations on the Ukrainian side. Hell even the people are openly fighting back in many areas and essentially fighting their own propaganda war with direct statements to Putin's soldiers. This does not even cover the volunteer forces that continue to grow, the continued arms shipments coming in, and the continued supply shipments coming in. The logistics are all but handled for Ukraine. Meanwhile the Putin has been throwing large scale advances at the Ukrainians and they have crumbled, even to the point of losing very large and prominent leaders. Additionally, it seems that Putin's forces cannot even fuel their own war effort. This is not what you would expect in even a 90 day campaign. 

What we have to begin to consider is the following:

1. There is a strong possibility the West as a whole, completely failed at their Intelligence. Meaning, we may need to completely re-evaluate the war machine that we thought was Putin's forces. Remember during WWII when the Allies created equipment out of wood and such? Not saying that happened with all the information, but disinformation is a very large part of confusing and deterring your enemy.

2. Yes, we may still see Putin come in with an all out strike with all of their modern equipment, bombing, etc. I would agree in that moment things look dire for the Ukrainians. However, we should have seen this activity for many of the other portions of the war. Why have they not obliterated air fields? Field munitions positions, forward operating positions? One could argue they want those intact, but rebuilding an airfield, even to modern standards, would be nothing compared to the potential problems they could cause. Shock and Awe has proven to be a game changing offensive. 

3. Sanctions have started to harm and will continue to harm Putin's war effort. We know these sanctions will hurt. We know that it will begin to cause more and more problems. If we put these in conjunction with the already known aspects of supply and logistics problems, we see a more grim picture painted for Putin's War. 

My position is not one that says that the Ukrainians are not in for a long and bitter fight. My position is not one that states there will not be heavy casualties and potentially great loss of life and viability. More my position is to say, it is far too soon to tell on either side. My hope is that the Ukrainians push back Putin's forces and that this war comes to a quick end.

Zelensky has no real clue what he's doing. He's an actor and a very, very brave man, and these two factors are congruent with seeming like an inspiring national leader. His job is to keep up morale and allow the general staff to implement whatever battle-plan they have. He is now (As are most politicians in occupied countries) less a leader than a figurehead and a diplomat. So I wouldn't look to him to find out if anyone should be confident. 

2) Perhaps NATO is confident (I don't know - every noise I have heard from a Western capital is that they expect this to turn into an Afghan-style meatgrinder).

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

As the U.S. and allies tighten sanctions on Russia and choke off investor demand for its assets, parts of Wall Street are jumping on the buying opportunity that it’s creating.  
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been purchasing beaten-down company bonds tied to Russia in recent days, as hedge funds that specialize in buying cheap credit look to load up on the assets, according to people with knowledge of the private transactions.  
Banks routinely scoop up debt because clients asked them to, or because they expect to find ready buyers.

Finding ways to wager on distressed securities is standard fare on Wall Street. But doing so in the wake of Russia’s widely condemned invasion of Ukraine brings unique risks. World leaders are seeking to punish some Russian companies and cut the country off from the global financial system, and any firm perceived as working against those interests faces potential reputational damage, market watchers say.  
“The whole point of the sanctions is to make them and their instruments untouchable,” said Athanassios Diplas, a veteran derivatives trader who was at Goldman Sachs during the 1998 Russian financial crisis. “I have no issues looking at arbitrage opportunities in distressed situations, like back in 1998. But this is different.”

To be sure, the sanctions on Russia haven’t outright banned trading in the assets.  
Goldman Sachs is primarily asking for corporate debt from the likes of Evraz Plc, Gazprom PJSC and Russian Railways that matures within the next two years, and has made bids for Russian sovereign notes, the people said.  
The purchases by banks underscore a facet of Wall Street’s longstanding culture: Trading desks are geared toward finding undervalued or mispriced assets, and their activities don’t necessarily reflect the broader view of their firm toward an asset class or nation.  
Representatives for Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.

Russian corporate bonds denominated in foreign currencies have plunged to deeply distressed levels in recent days. The debt may soon be removed from major benchmarks, and concern is mounting that companies could miss principal payments.  
JPMorgan was telling clients that it traded about $200 million of Russian and Ukrainian corporate debt Thursday, including from clients seeking to exit positions.  
Still, some banks and fund managers are erring toward caution, either reining in or abstaining from such transactions amid the rapidly evolving situation, people familiar with the matter said.  
At one major U.S. hedge fund, a decision was made to avoid Russian bonds entirely for now. The specter of holding debt that could become untradeable in another round of sanctions is too risky, and the war is just a week in. At another, the decision was made to look only at corporate bonds that aren’t majority owned by the Russian government.  
“What we’re seeing is a bit of revulsion -- more and more institutions are steering clear of Russia due to reputational risks and pure difficulties in clearing and executing trades,” said Sally Greig, a money manager at Baillie Gifford in Edinburgh. “You have to tear up the distressed playbook. This is not the usual distressed situation. This is a very difficult time.”  
CDS Play  
Goldman Sachs is also trading credit-default swaps on names including Evraz and Gazprom, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.

The market for Russian default protection has faced growing scrutiny this week as traders try to understand if the contracts insuring $41 billion of sovereign debt could be rendered worthless by sanctions, or could be triggered in the event of a technical default.   
In some cases investors have been pitched so-called basis trades, where Russian corporate bonds would be bought simultaneously with CDS that insure against a default, some of the people said.  
CDS tied to Russian government debt this week signaled a 65% chance of default within five years and 40% within one year, according to ICE Data Services.

It then launches three laser beam riding submunitions, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit on the target.

 >The Battle of Ilovaisk started on 7 August 2014, when the Armed Forces of Ukraine and pro-Ukrainian paramilitaries began a series of attempts to capture the city of Ilovaisk from pro-Russian insurgents affiliated with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and detachments of the Russian Armed Forces. Although Ukrainian forces were able to enter the city on 18 August, they were encircled between 24 and 26 August by overwhelming Russian military forces that crossed the border, joining the battle. After days of encirclement, government forces allegedly made an agreement with the insurgents to be allowed to retreat from the city.

Things have to get REALLY bad for NATO to do this, as this sends a message to the rest of the world (i.e. China and North Korea) that NATO is no longer a purely defensive pact between its members. At that point the likes of China will quickly adopt a stance of ""well, if NATO can do whatever, there's no point in us playing nice anymore"".

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

1) The West did not fail in its intelligence gathering and execution. They were aware and shared everything they knew out loud and have proved to be mostly correct. No one thought that an invasion would happen. No one. And to prepare for something so unforeseen would undoubtedly lead to perceived escalation from Putin, making things worse. You don't want to ratchet up tensions on something that you believe is so unlikely, based on the intelligence you have at that time.

2) As many way way more intelligent and knowledgeable military analysts and minds have stated, the Russian air force is very capable, but it now seems that they are not as well coordinated or able to carry out some operations as everyone though, even the Russians. HOWEVER, let's not let that take away from the fact that Russia does have superior air capability and has yet to use it in full, even if it is not as capable as everyone thought. It can still be a severe detrimental factor to the Ukrainians, and probably a tipping point, to be honest.

3) Sanctions will hit them hard, but the problem is, Putin doesn't care. The oligarchs do not control Putin. If anything, the oligarchs are controlled by Putin. And unless there is an internal assassination attempt or an internal revolt by the people of Russia, sadly, nothing will happen from the inside. It's the unfortunate reality and simply how the geopolitical board has been drawn with the West and Russia.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

 >The Winter War, also known as First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II; the war ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

 >The phantom time hypothesis is a historical conspiracy theory asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retroactively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.

Not disagreeing, but I'd like speak to your phrasing here. It sounds as if your saying NATO doesn't *care* about the war, although I realize that is not what you meant.

NATO is certainly *concerned* about the war, but their treaty does not allow them, as an organization, to take direct action. They are solely a defensive organization, restricted to *defending* their member countries.

If I understand correctly, an individual NATO country *could* enter the conflict, but they would waive NATO protection by doing so.

I don't mean to sound nitpicky or critical, just trying to be sensitive about the messaging, as I feel NATO is being treated unfairly by many posters in these threads who are, rightfully, frustrated and emotional over what is happening.

For those of you who feel that way, consider how the NATO commanders and troops feel. Can you imagine having the means to intervene, but having to hold back because *many millions* of more lives depend on you doing so?

Imagine that you are in a boat with 3 children, and the boat overturns and throws all of you in the water. You are able to grab and hold onto 2 of the children, but the 3rd child is too far away to reach, and you would have to turn loose of the children you hold in order to swim to the 3rd one.

Basically, the eastern European countries form the mouth of funnel leading into Russia, which is mostly a huge, wide-open plain after that, with no real defensive features. That narrow bit is much easier to defend than the wide open space it leads into. It also has mountains.  If he can push his boundaries, at least through something like the old Warsaw Pact, back up to Germany, he has an amazingly small border to defend.

He's so paranoid that he actually thinks it's necessary to do this to protect Russia. It's not his only reason for wanting Ukraine, but it's a large part of it.

I've linked the video, if you want to watch it. The first 30 seconds is an advertisement for Curiosity Stream, so you can skip that, and the rest is about 30 minutes long. As always, take it with a grain of salt, as I'm sure there are nuances, but it seems pretty solid.

The crew on a artillery peice sits pretty far back from the frontline, let's just say 15 miles from the target.  No one on the gun crew makes decisions about what they are to fire at.  They cannot see their targets.  They rely entirely on the guidance of forward observers to tell them what to shoot at.

The forward observer see a target, he relays the location and description of the target to a fires support cell, that translates the location of the target into information that can be used by the gun crew.  Basically telling the gun crew to aim your weapon at XYZ degrees laterally and XYZ degrees vertically, fire this type of round with this type of fuzing, with this much powder.

The gun crew only knows that they are firing at XYZ grid based on what the forward observer said.   They also know the description of the target based on what the forward observer said.  The description is typically ""enemy troops dug in"" ""enemy vehicles in the open"" or so on.

Generally smaller in explosive power, they are defined in contrast to strategic nuclear weapons, which are designed mostly to be targeted at the enemy interior away from the war front against military bases, cities, towns, arms industries, and other hardened or larger-area targets to damage the enemy's ability to wage war.

 >The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast  (MOAB , colloquially known as the ""Mother of All Bombs"") is a large-yield bomb, developed for the United States military by Albert L. Weimorts, Jr. of the Air Force Research Laboratory. It was first tested in 2003. At the time of development, it was said to be the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the American arsenal. The bomb is designed to be delivered by a C-130 Hercules, primarily the MC-130E Combat Talon I or MC-130H Combat Talon II variants.
 
**[Father of All Bombs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_All_Bombs)** 
 
 >Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power (ATBIP; Russian: Авиационная вакуумная бомба повышенной мощности, АВБПМ), nicknamed ""Father of All Bombs"" (FOAB; Russian: ""Папа всех бомб"", Пвб), is a Russian-designed, bomber-delivered thermobaric weapon. The bomb is reportedly similar to the US military's GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast which is often unofficially called ""Mother of All Bombs"" derived from its official military acronym ""MOAB"". This weapon would therefore be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world. However, the veracity of Russia's claims concerning the weapon's size and power have been questioned by US defense analysts"".
 
**[TOS-1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOS-1)** 
 
 >TOS-1 (Russian: тяжёлая огнемётная система [ТОС-1], Heavy Flamethrower System) is a Soviet 220 mm 30-barrel (original system, Object 634 or TOS-1M) or 24-barrel (Object 634B or TOS-1A) multiple rocket launcher and thermobaric weapon mounted on a T-72 tank chassis. TOS-1 was designed to attack enemy fortified positions and lightly armoured vehicles and transports, in open terrain in particular. First combat tests took place in 1988 and 1989 in the Panjshir Valley during the Soviet–Afghan War. The TOS-1 was shown for the first time in public in 1999 in Omsk.

I just mentioned it because it looks like NATO might become an important decider in Sweden while not in Finland. Left is generally less in favour of NATO than the right, so it is telling that a left-wing PM in previously non-aligned Finland goes ""We kinda need to take this seriously maybe.""




Meanwhile in Sweden, asking someone about NATO is almost a determinant of their political party. Almost guaranteed to be right wing if they want Sweden in NATO. So given some early polling data that indicate increased support for NATO and increased fear of Russia, the incumbent party might need to change their stance or risk facing some drops.

Again if this was the case surely you would send your most capable to get it done swiftly and cleanly? But again the Russian is not western in their way of thinking. They have a history of high casualties in war (just look at the Wehrmacht versus Russian army in ww2 Russia got slaughtered) and reliance on conscripts to point out pockets of resistance through their own downfall and exploit areas which suffer less. Hence their ability to encircle a fair few cities already.  After all no plan survived contact with the enemy as they say. They’re now consolidating forces and creating new supply zones deeper into Ukrainian territory. This will allow their units to project deeper into Ukraine which is a bloody big country. They could of course just be mulling around due to incompetence but I doubt that despite what media would have you believe. The Ukrainians are able to make use of this time by pushing back but that’s largely because Russian forces are consolidating controlled territory ready to push in again to the next objectives.

Paratroopers while elite units in most armies are armed in a lighter fashion then even basic infantry or mechanised units. Being dropped behind enemy lines means you’re instantly surrounded and under contact by a determined and well trained force such as the Ukrainians will lead to disaster if lines of support are not established which such units failed to do. 

The VDV in particular have a history of being heavily propagandised in Russia. They even have a day to celebrate them I think where they jump into fountains lmao. They rely on an image of strength in order to exploit the VDVs true use in modern warfare. Forward riot police esque units in areas Russia plan to subjugate and exploit a lack of will and resistance. They are not that effective in combatting highly motivated and well supplied units which the Ukrainians in that area would have been.

Russia has nothing to gain in attacking Ukraine, every Russian soldier knows it, or will know it the longer this war continues. We've seen reports from various sources, some of which are not pro-Ukraine of multiple soldiers fleeing combat / abandonning equipment and that is just 9 days in. 

  
Time is also a huge factor and it plays in favor of Ukraine. In Lviv for example, they have so many volunteers enlisting for the army they are only picking the best ones, that's without mentioning foreign fighters joining in, or even civilians armed to the teeth. 

  
The russian economy will not be able to sustain this war effort, there will be more and more discontent in Russia, people and soldier will more and more be able to see the reality they are in.

I fucking hate the ""something must be done"" people. Ok say what exactly. Some solutions, something

NATO (or USA whatever) should intervene or go home. Simple. Those are the 2 options there is no middle one.

Like it or not civil war is absolute hell and a government will take anyone they can get to keep power. Ukraine was in a civil war and arguably also a Russian invasion in 2014. 

Just like the US took slave states and allowed them to continue the absolute atrocity of slavery In order to further their war efforts, while at the same time denouncing slavery as an unjustifiable evil and declaring it illegal in all states that didn’t side with the union. 

It’s awful that this is the case, but it’s how it goes. It’s not unique to Ukraine. You will see this all throughout history. Hell, you even see it with the Nazis and the communists. Hitler split Poland with the communists (his biggest hatred outside the Jews) to further his governments war efforts. It’s textbook strategy for almost every major power. 

America allowed Bacha Bazi (child prostitution/molestation, a practice even the Taliban banned) in Afghanistan for TWENTY years to further their goals there. This is how war goes.

Put all the ideological stuff aside, post-WW2 was essentially the pre-WW1 Massive Alliance System in action only again. Just Nukes and WW legacy stopped anyone really wanting to fight directly.

However, here we are with a war in Ukraine specifically because the Warsaw Pact and the entire Soviet Union collapsed (because economically and ideologically there was nothing to back it all up - World Communism wasn't winning at that point) and Russia has been left exposed. It's not so much expansionism to the Russian leaders' mindset as Holding The Line.

The geographic area of modern Ukraine has always been a security concern for Russia. Wide expanse, flat land, no mountains, links to the black sea. Never a problem if Ukraine was Russian controlled or Russian aligned. Two Ukrainian revolutions later and Russia sees a situation it existentially cannot allow to happen - Ukraine joining the rival alliance.",False,1646479246.0,t3_t72muj,t1_hzfuwnd,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Europe's biggest problem generally is that it paralyses itself when it's under threat, and looks the other way until the threat is on its doorstep.

Both of these things are happening before your eyes. Russia isn't going to settle its imperialistic ambitions (nor is China for that matter), so responding to the smaller threat now will, like in the 1930s, save us from dealing with a bigger threat later.

Russia isn't going to do the whole ""the world just boomed me"" meme because we cut them off from the global economy (except for, y'know, their major export) or because Ukraine made them look like fools on the world stage. Now is one of those times where escalating now is more likely than not going to save us a hell of a lot of grief later.

Putin isn't trying to find reasons to nuke the world, there's a reason he toes the line enough to keep away from engaging NATO.

Do you believe that Ukraine -ought- to align as a vassal state of Russia, or that they shouldn't have agency in the matter because they're too weak to defeat Russia militarily?",False,1646478425.0,t3_t72muj,t1_hzfu9ml,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

Yeah, half the country was mad that Yanukovich went against EU membership, but it's still only half the country. This is not an excuse for the west to get involved to try and make them a NATO country.

I don't give a fuck what Ukraine decides to do for themselves. I wish they had their own autonomy, but it's not our business. You're the one trying to make it our business for no good reason other than Russia bad, NATO good. You're not even trying to understand that this isn't about any of that. It's about opening up Ukraine to the IMF and western private interests. 

I've already explained to you that escalating the war to get ourselves involved is just a dumb reason to get Americans killed.",False,1646479693.0,t3_t72muj,t1_hzfurzm,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I believe that showing strength and backbone to Russia is the only way to curb their aggression. You seem to believe we should just mind our business and let people die because they're not our people. These are both valid viewpoints. 

I don't think any business deal is worth all these people's lives, and to attribute responsibility to NATO rather than the country attacking them and murdering them, I think, lacks a certain authenticity and humanity.

If this was an interpersonal conflict between a couple people, with a man wanting to beat on his ex-girlfriend in public for associating with another man, many bystanders would jump in to stop it heedless of risks to themselves.",False,1646479999.0,t3_t72muj,t1_hzfwb4l,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

That is going to take many times more lives than keeping this contained to Ukraine by not getting involved militarily. I don't know what you expect Russia to do if NATO gets involved. They're only using a fraction of their military, and they've already threatened to use nukes. It's just nuts that you think they're going to get mowed down like some 3rd rate middle eastern army.
