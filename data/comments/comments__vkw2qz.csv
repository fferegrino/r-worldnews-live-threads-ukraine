Before he met French President Emmanuel Macron at the G7 summit in Germany, Boris Johnson was asked whether France and Germany were doing enough over Ukraine.

In his response, the prime minister focused on the German response without mentioning France.

""Just look at what the Germans alone have done,"" he said.

Mr Johnson said Chancellor Olaf Scholz has sent weapons to the Ukrainians and he has ""made huge, huge strides (on energy imports). We have 4% of our gas comes from Russia, in Germany, it's 40%"".

""They're facing real, real pressures, they're having to source energy from elsewhere. But they're doing it. They're making the effort. They're making the sacrifice.

""That's because they see that the price of freedom is worth paying.""

The prime minister added: ""And the consequences of what's happening for the world are tough, but the price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed , to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest, that price will be far, far higher and everybody here understands that.""

25.06.2022 23:59

A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Friday introduced a resolution characterizing Russia‚Äôs actions in Ukraine as an act of genocide.

That‚Äôs according to¬†Foreign Policy, Ukrinform reports.

A draft of the resolution, seen by Foreign Policy, argues that atrocities committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians, the direct targeting of maternity hospitals and medical facilities, and the forcible transfer of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to Russia and Russian-held territory meet the criteria laid out in Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.


Explaining their position, the sponsors of the resolution point to statements made by Russian state media and top officials, including President Vladimir Putin, aimed at undermining Ukrainian statehood and sovereignty.

It is noted that atrocities in Ukraine are committed for a specific purpose. This is evidenced, among other things, by the fact that in April this year, Putin awarded a number of Russian servicemen and units accused of committing war crimes in¬†Bucha, including torture, rape, and extrajudicial killings of civilians.

Congressional resolutions are commonly used by lawmakers to express strongly held sentiments by members of the House of Representatives or Senate. Although the resolution is not legally binding, it sends a strong message of condemnation of Russia‚Äôs actions in Ukraine and indicates ongoing efforts by members of Congress to provide continued support to Ukraine beyond military aid.

Back in April 2022, U.S. President Joe¬†Biden¬†has already referred to Russian atrocities in Ukraine as genocide.

Day 123 of my updates from Kharkiv.

They have been using way more missiles in the past couple of days. That apartment building that was hit yesterday was actually hit from an Uragan MLRS, and not by Iskander, its rockets only have 90kg warheads, so it only destroyed part the roof. And then just a couple hours after that they bombed another apartment building in Kyiv, but with a much bigger missile, so it destroyed 3 floors.

After they fired their missiles in the morning, they said that they hit training bases, but actually they hit an apartment building full of people, and a kindergarten. Seriously, a kindergarten? Is that their definition of a training facility for soldiers? Or will they say that Nazi child soldiers were being trained in that kindergarten?

Today they also fired 6 missiles on Kharkiv at 11:30pm. We almost always get an alert around 3 minutes before impact, and I have to say, the anticipation is suffocating every single time. You just read ‚Äúmissiles in the air, ETA 3 minutes‚Äù and you can‚Äôt even do anything, only count the explosions, and hope that it doesn‚Äôt land near you, it becomes even worse when new messages pop up, saying more missiles were fired. 

From the 6 missiles fired today, only 4 explosions were heard, so 2 or more missiles were most likely shot down, the second explosion was extremely loud for us, it sounded very close, but the distance is pretty hard to judge, some of the explosions that we thought were close, actually happened very far away.

New exports of Russian gold will no longer be allowed to enter the four countries after tough new measures designed to ratchet up the pressure on the Kremlin amid its war in Ukraine were applied.

Gold is Russia's biggest non-energy export which was worth ¬£12.6 billion to the Russian economy in 2021.

The UK import restrictions will now apply to over ¬£13.5 billion worth of Russian exports.¬†

Speaking on the new measures, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The measures we have announced today will directly hit Russian oligarchs and strike at the heart of Putin‚Äôs war machine.

""Putin is squandering his dwindling resources on this pointless and barbaric war. He is bankrolling his ego at the expense of both the Ukrainian and Russian people.

""We need to starve the Putin regime of its funding. The UK and our allies are doing just that.""

The ban is due to come into force shortly and will apply to newly mined or refined gold.¬†

It will not affect Russian-origin gold that has been previously exported from Russia, the British government added.¬†

As a result of a strike by HIMARS multiple rocket launchers that Ukraine had recently obtained from the United States as part of security assistance, the Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian command posts in Donbas.

That‚Äôs according to a report by¬†Guildhall¬†citing a source in Ukrainian intelligence, Ukrinform reports.

On June 24, the Ukrainians destroyed a command post of the 20th Army of the Russian Armed Forces‚Äô Western Military District (unit 89425, originally based in Voronezh), located in a school building. As a result of the strike, a significant number of Russian officers with the army headquarters were hit, while much of the enemy equipment parked at the site was damaged.

The source provided photos and videos showing the aftermath of the attack.

Also overnight Friday, the advanced command post of the Russian army‚Äôs airborne assault troops was hit by another strike. A significant amount of equipment and weapons was destroyed in the attack, which also brought multiple casualties to enemy forces. One of the commanders of the 106th airborne assault division, Colonel A.V. Vasilyev, (unit 55599, originally from Tula) was eliminated, the report says.

Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Biden praised the allies who had stuck together and stood up to the Kremlin over the past four months.

However, he warned: ""We have to stay together, because Putin has been counting on from the beginning that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter.

""But we haven't and we're not going to.

""We can't let this aggression take the form it has and get away with it.""

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 June 2022
 
- Most Ukrainian forces have likely withdrawn from their remaining defensive positions in the Donbas city of Sieverodonetsk. In April 2022, Russia revised its immediate campaign plan from aiming to occupy the majority of Ukraine, to a more focused offensive in the Donbas. Russia's capture of the city is a significant achievement within this reduced objective. The settlement was a major industrial centre and it occupies a strategic position on the Siverskyi Donets River.


- However, it is only one of several challenging objectives Russia will need to achieve to occupy the whole of the Donbas region. These include advancing on the major centre of Kramatorsk and securing the main supply routes to Donetsk city.

>The all-cast turret, with a maximum armor thickness of 319 mm

And the thing rides on top of its tracks - four tracks... The entire bottom of this thing... All it is *is* tracks.

Over **60** metric tons! (63 when loaded with General Pavel).  Holy cow - but get this, because the entire bottom is tracked, the pressure is only about 8.5 pounds per square inch (8.92 with Pavel) and one of the main design intentions was for it to traverse boggy, nasty terrain.

The wiki states that the program was shut down because the Soviets were shying away from heavy armor at the time, there were concerns that bridges wouldn't be able to support it, it was a maintenance nightmare, it was difficult to produce, and the thing was too damn tall.

Still, though, at 60 metric tons?  ...Now *that's* a tank.  It's a shame they've written it off as scrap.

>This special purpose tank was intended to fight on cross country terrain, inaccessible to conventional tanks, acting as a heavy breakthrough tank, and if necessary withstanding even the shockwave of a nuclear explosion. It was planned as a tank of the Supreme Command Reserve.

It's effectively an unsinkable AA ship in that regard, if the Russians have active AA there it shuts down Ukraine's ability to fly over even Odesa and basically denies Ukraine any airspace along the entire Ukrainian coastline.

Of course, unlike a ship, it also can't move and it's not got a lot of area or cover, so something like MLRS that can hit every last inch of the island - on a standard 1km grid map, it's quite literally a quarter of a grid square at 0.6x0.4km - is very effective at eliminating anything there.

So basically Russia wants to site AA there because it's a great site to do so and has a *lot* of power if successful, Ukraine has a relatively easy task of removing said AA if they can get MLRS in range.

The Baltic countries as well as Poland will likely continue with their strategy of full support for Ukraine, since it very much is in the national interest of all those countries that Russia is defeated in Ukraine, or at the very least severely weakened. 

Some European countries on the other hand may with time weaken their stance as public interest drops. 

I don't see the UK changing their stance anytime soon. I think Boris Johnson see the Ukraine issue as a useful distraction for his own internal political issues. Of course this can change if he's forced to resign, but i think even if he does resign whoever assumes his position in the conservative party is likely going to maintain a strong stance on Ukraine, for similar reasons, it helps push an image of the UK taking a leading role in the security of Europe. 

The US is a big question mark, mid terms are right around the corner, and it looks like the democrats are going to get their asses kicked, so the US is looking at a future of a Democratic President with a republican congress. Biden is likely going to continue pushing for more support for Ukraine, a Ukrainian victory may wash away some of the bad press Biden had with the Afghanistan disaster. The issue will be congress with Republicans in control. Though the core of the republican party will likely continue to push for more support for Ukraine, the extreme wing of the party that has been consuming the party ever since Trump arrived will likely push for the opposite, more isolationism less support for NATO and reconciliation with Russia.

Except ISIS did not have 6000 nuclear  warheads, thousands of missiles, and bombers, satellite network, and foreign intelligence services, nor did they have a massive international propaganda delivery newsmedia network, or thousands of highly-placed political enablers in hundreds of countries worldwide. 

Would I like to see Moscow burn? Oh yes, I would very much like that. Would I like to see New York City burn (again)?  No thank you. 

That said, in my opinion, there is a margin of error in these kinds of Strategic activities, and as yesterday's Kyiv bombing is an escalatory response to very legitimate targets being struck in russian-occupied areas of eastern Ukraine, (and it's intended as a signal that Russia is willing to escalate much further the harder Ukraine 'fights back') - I **do** believe that Russia will NOT cross the 'red line' of striking Ukraine's allies unless there is direct military involvement by those allies. Because that's going down a road Russia can't afford to head down. Putin has not yet accepted that he is losing this war, and has lost this war. And he will continue prosecuting it until that capability is removed from him, by force.  

And that necessarily means striking strategic targets in Russia. Ukraine HAS to do this. Putin has given them no choice. And if the west does not supply the necessary equipment, Ukraine must find another way. Have no doubt that they will.  

The question is: will relying on Ukraine to fight THAT part of the war result in an end to the war sooner, or later?  Later is a very expensive proposition (both economically, and politically) for the West. So it's in the West's best interest that the war be ended sooner, so we can avoid the very unpleasant consequences of sustained economic ""inconvenience"" and the political turmoil (fascist/populist/nationalist takeover of western allied governments).

For years, the EU has relied on the US to solve the force problem and skimped on their own military spending.  That's why the US' response to Ukraine spooked half of Europe - since it seems like Europe expected the US to have a much stronger military response.   Ultimately, it's a European problem and it'd be a pain to come off of a 20 year war right into a global war that is, once again, in Europe.  The US' best interests are served with our current response - training, intel, weapons, & money, but not soldiers.

We've got a trifecta-- Patriots, which are massive, complicated integrated systems for air defense.  Stingers (both man-launched and from vehicles) for low flying targets in terminal attack phase.  And of course, fighters and A2A.

(Not counting all the naval stuff, which is different and weird for various reasons).

But we don't have any simpler systems that can provide high altitude, long range defense with less logistical support.  It's fighters or Patriot.

The whole concept of taking an AMRAAM and surface-launching it -- SLAMRAAM-- is a couple decades old.  We abandoned the concept, figuring we didn't need it (after demoing launching AMRAAMs out of HIMARS, among other things).  But Northern Europe picked it up and ran with it.

> I don‚Äôt imagine they work near as well fired from the ground. But still effective, I take it?

Rule of thumb would be a dome that's about 50 km radius and 16 kilometers high at its apex (there's a few extended range missiles that can do longer).  Compare to 90-150km for Patriot, and 8km or less for Stinger.

As we have seen unfold, he sees himself as remaking the Russian Empire.  Not the USSR, but the Empire at its height.  Even the palace guards look like they are specifically from the empire from the time of Napoleon.  He views the world as essentially explicit blocks of power and influence, with the European powers bickering over their neighbors, the US owning North America, and China I guess getting South East Asia.  His understanding of the world is rigid, so he sees his smaller neighbors to the west as by right his.

An interesting note is Russia during the 19th century after Napoleon was basically the whiniest country of Europe.  As other countries industrialized, Russia looked at their economy and kinda put their hands in the air and said, ""Alas, if we do nothing we will become Europe's colony"".  They really delayed in doing something, but eventually they did.  However, there was a naval arms race.  Kind of like the nuclear arms race, European powers were putting bigger and bigger guns on ships.  Without air craft carriers, the safest way to fight was the have a ship that could shoot further than the rest.  This sort of innovation is super costly though, so Russia petitioned the European powers for everyone to get together and put caps on military strength, so Europe (read: Russia) would not have to invest so heavily.  I think Putin's propaganda machine has had a distinctly whiny sound to it.  With stuff like, ""Oh, we're really fighting NATO and that's why we're losing"" or essentially asking Ukraine to not fight back so hard.

Another point that I have not looked into as heavily is drawing attention away from Desert Storm and Blitzkrieg and more towards the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia on 1968.  From what I have gathered, the Soviets took control of strategic areas to cripple the revolution and used riot police to instill cruel order.  The current invasion tried to do the first, and had plenty of riot gear to do the second, along with rumors of dress unfiorms among the invaders ' baggage (though I have not seen multiple sources on that).

Hitler went through Belgium despite the fact that when Kaiser Wilhelm tried it, Germany lost.  Germany had a strong start, but still lost.  Watching Putin purposely try to return to a point in time when Russia was already declining in regards to it's competitors and rivals is surreal still.  Sure, the Russian Empire was bullying central Asian nomads, but a stiff western breeze stopped it in it's tracks.  Or hell, the Japanese navy.",False,1656244662.0,t3_vkw2qz,t1_idsekae,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

The Ukrainian view is to constantly emphasize that they're outgunned in this war. Which is technically true, Russia has way more weapons than Ukraine, even with all this Western support. So Ukraine is constantly in a position to be asking for more and more weapons.

The main issue is that the war the USA / NATO was prepared for, always had us outnumbered by Russia. This is all to plan. Our weapons are fewer in number, but far more advanced, accurate, and reliable. We never planned to beat Russia in a brute-force raw numbers game.

I don't think its necessarily ""propaganda"" to admit these facts. The reminder of the realities of this war are still important, for Ukrainian soldiers to know what they're up against, as well as for the American people to remember why we're giving this level of unprecedented aid.

But, there's more to it than that.

It's a recipe for a traumatized culture. Where the people who oppose the status quo can't build structures and can't trust anyone, and the people who don't are zombies.

No wonder, then, that millions of Russians have fled the country. Given the choice between supporting the country by staying, trying to stand up to the country by protesting without any mass behind them, or leaving, it's obvious why the preferred choice is just bailing out.

>  The idea that Ukraine is going to invade Russia is straight out of Putin's delusions.

No, Ukraine isn't going to invade Russia, but it's a legitimate response to invasion to perform raids and attacks on your invader-- *especially* areas used in staging and logistics.

E.g., when we're talking about MLRS in particular in this thread, CSIS notes:

""However, this would be a significant escalation of the conflict. Although the Ukrainian military has conducted some strikes into the Russian homeland, these have been few and with Ukrainian assets. Supplying a U.S. munition with the primary purpose of striking targets in the Russian homeland would be perceived as both a signal about widening the war and potentially threatening the Russian regime. President Biden has said that he wants to avoid risking the Russian reaction.""  https://www.csis.org/analysis/will-united-states-provide-long-range-rockets-ukraine

Basically, to the extent that US-given assets are used to hit Russian territory, it could be argued that it's ""really just NATO attacking Russia with Ukrainian fingers on the trigger"".  It provides way too much temptation to take small retaliatory actions -- aimed no doubt at stopping attacks on its own territory, but widening the war.

Indeed, Biden said about a month ago ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia."" in response to a journalist's question.

As for reasons why the USA invaded, it was found out later to be bullshit. They didn‚Äôt have any working WMDs and the initially presented evidence to support it was spurious at best.
