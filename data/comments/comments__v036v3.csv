From CNN's Tim Lister and Yulia Kesaieva 

The Ukrainian military says it has begun a counter-offensive against Russian forces in the south and has claimed significant advances in the direction of Kherson.

Serhii Hlan, a deputy who sits on the Kherson region council, said on Saturday Ukrainian forces ""continued offensive operations and pushed the enemy back 9 kilometers (5 miles) in the Beryslav district.""

Hlan also claimed that Ukrainian units ""broke the enemy grouping into two parts and actually encircled the enemy grouping in Davidiv Brid."" 

Davidiv Brid has been on the front lines for weeks and became an escape route for civilians trying to leave Kherson, often under fire.

The Ukrainian military published video of artillery strikes, purportedly against Russian positions. It said on Facebook that ""the artillery war continues.""

""Ukrainian soldiers chase and burn the occupiers' equipment on the lands of Kherson and Mykolaiv regions,"" it said. ""Kherson hold on, we're close!""",False,1653836100.0,t3_v036v3,t3_v036v3,,0,104,0,104,0,0,

Ukraine has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and self-propelled howitzers from the United States, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said.

Reznikov said Ukraine had received a range of heavy artillery pieces, including modified US-made M109 self-propelled howitzers that will allow the Ukrainian military to strike targets from longer distances.

Harpoon shore-to-ship missiles will be operated alongside Ukrainian Neptune missiles in the defence of the country’s coast, including the southern port of Odesa, the minister wrote on his Facebook page.

Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration in southern Ukraine, said in an online post that “so many Harpoons have been handed over to us that we can sink the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet. Why not?”",False,1653799611.0,t3_v036v3,t3_v036v3,,0,93,0,93,0,0,

Day 95 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today some residential districts were shelled yet again, but thankfully nobody died, apparently no one even got injured, even though a lot of buildings were damaged. It was pretty quiet around my area, it was not targeted directly this time, but we still heard plenty of explosions, some of which were from our own artillery.

And at midnight shelling started again, which means that this is definitely their new schedule. They even fired more missiles at Merefa again, not sure why, they have been doing it every day for quite some time already. No details about what was targeted yet, but it caused a big fire.

Also yesterday Russian MOD said some stuff about Kozacha Lopan. They said that there are ammo depots on the territory of the poultry farm, and that farm’s personnel is being forcibly kept in the basement. They also said that there are military vehicles hidden in the hangars. They wanted to make our army look bad with this, but there’s one *small detail* they forgot about. 

Kozacha Lopan is under Russian control since day one, so are they leaking their own army’s positions to us, or what is this all about? Does their MOD really not even know what territories they control? Surely they can’t be **that** incompetent?

From a strategic point of view, the extra 15km of land that Russia will gain from taking their current objectives is not even close to the value of troops and equipment they are losing.

The only result that can come from Russia’s attacks in that area is a hastening of their demise.

Keep in mind that as the balance of the war shifts, Ukraine will not counterattack here. This will be one of the last areas Ukraine will take back. Areas like Kherson and Izyum are far more practical and strategically important to Ukraine. So is Southern Ukraine and then Mariupol.

By the time Severodonetsk is re-visited by Ukraine, the battle for the Donbas will already be over. Russias supply lines will be already cut. Ukraine will not pay the same price Russia is paying now to take it back.

The only rational explanation for this offensive by Russia is it is purely for reasons of internal politics and propaganda. So Russia can still print headlines about the Russian army being “on the attack” and being able to “push the Ukrainians back”. It’s sacrificing its troops so the public can be kept in a fantasy world where Russia isn’t failing.

It’s foolish, horrific, and needless.

> Which brings us to the idea of breaking the blockade by escorting merchant ships. The first challenge is the most obvious: Who will do the escorting? This could be done under the auspices of the United Nations, by NATO or by a coalition of nations willing to undertake what will be a provocative and dangerous mission. 

> The most likely approach would be the latter, led by the US and probably including the UK and France, and perhaps Black Sea nations Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.

> A second challenge will be clearing mines, because both the Ukrainians and Russians have used them to try and control the seas along the Ukrainian coast. NATO has a standing force of minesweepers for exactly this purpose. This flotilla is operating under the command of one of my successors as supreme allied commander, General Tod Wolters.

> Third, the nations carrying out any blockade would need to work with the major shipping countries and the international merchants who carry and own the grain and other products. This could be organized by the International Maritime Organization, headquartered in London. Part of the UN, the IMO played a similar role in organizing international responses to piracy off the coast of Africa when I was NATO commander.

Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.

The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.

The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.

""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said.

The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.

In cases like that, the only way to even find that content as an English-speaker is to translate search terms to Russian, Google those in Cyrillic, and translate the search results back to English.   
  
It's been useful for finding the model of industrial bread ovens the Russians are using, as well as confirming fires or oligarch ""suicides"" before they are confirmed in the English-speaking world. I'm sure there will be other instances it's useful as a technique.   
   
Because I'm lazy and couldn't find anything like this already, I threw together the tiniest html page possible that does exactly that. It's just a label, a text box, a button, and some code that takes the contents of the search box, translates it to Russian using the LibreTranslate API, Googles the result, and feeds the Google search results page back through the Google Translate API to translate the whole page back from Russian into English.   
  
Here's the repo if people are interested. Sorry it looks like shit, I'm not a web coder and I literally could not care less about making it pretty.   
  
Note that because the code is HTML and contains Javascript, the Rugler will not display as a webpage but rather as plaintext. This is for security reasons, if such a thing were permitted all sorts of malicious code could be executed. Since all of this code fits in <50 lines (and the functional part within ~25), I invite you to inspect it for yourselves before using it if you intend to do so.   
  
If you do not know enough to figure out how to open the page locally on your device, you probably don't know enough to tell that the code isn't malicious and for security hygene's sake you probably shouldn't even try. That being said, I purposefully kept the code as small as possible so it would be easy to check.   
  
The only things I would've liked to add were more language codes (to/from, for example) and being able to take those along with search terms from the URL via GET, as well as through clicking the button or pressing enter on the form.

Between March 30 and May 26, Germany made only two arms supplies to Ukraine. In April, these were, in particular, spare parts for machine guns, hand grenades, mines, explosive cords, and in May - 4,600 anti-tank mines.

The last delivery of Strela anti-aircraft systems and Panzerfaust 3 grenade launchers was made at the end of March, although in April and May Ukraine requested this and other weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

I disagree. Yes, it's costly to take it (like every other city), but compared to the many blunders Russia has made in this war (like trying to take Kyiv), attempting to take Severodonetsk is a very sensible move for them. Along with their assault on Lyman, it secures the entirety of Ukraine past the Siverskyi Donets River and eliminates a bridgehead for any Ukrainian counterattack past the river. 

If Russia's new goal is to try to secure as much territory as they can and then grind the front line to a halt like happened with Donbas in 2015, then this is necessary.

As a rule, most people in Western countries don't care that much about what goes on in the rest of the world. Genocides and wars on the scale of what we're seeing in Ukraine have been active in Burma and Ethiopia in the past year, for example, with little interest from the West. 

Russia is betting that the reaction is shock value because of the proximity, not any expression of deep seated values. 

 They also know that in oppositional electoral systems, there is always advantage to be gained by saying the other side cares to much what happens overseas and not enough to their own people's pocketbooks. Opposition to American aid to Ukraine was already in the platform of the runner up of the past French Presidential election, is in the platform of the likely American Republican Presidential nominee and many European countries are ""deeply concerned"" about the effects of the war on their bottom lines - not just Hungary, but Germany and Italy as well. 

They are banking on one of several possible scenarios that include one of the following: 

1) Victories by the Republicans in the midterms, followed by Trump forcing his party into the pro-Russian camp to end American support and shatter the pro-Ukraine coalition from its heart.

2.) Winter may soften already lukewarm support in Europe and Canada, as concerns about sky high gas and petrol prices eat away at government majorities. It's not that governments and people will be anti-Ukraine per se, but that a fix for the economy will be necessary to save governments from getting killed in the polls. 

3.)  Western populations are driven by sensationalist news cycles. News outlets rely on a never-ending stream of ""new"", ""dangerous"" and ""exciting"" to grab people's attention. Over time, things that were sensationalist one day get drowned out by the next big scandal or disaster. It's how the NRA endures an endless stream of school shoots that occur only in America without consequence, and why governments everywhere rely on ""task forces"" and ""commissions"" to deal with really thorny issues - they call the commission when the issue is in the news, and by the time their report is ready, everyone's forgotten about it and moved on.

If they are ferociously determined they can force either a siege or a bloody and devastating attack on the city. There are precedents for this from the second world war, where the Japanese in particular would try to hold positions long after they were defensible, and would gladly sacrifice foreign civilians to do so.  

On the other hand, usually both the commanding generals and the troops of an invading army themselves normally believe that the lives and equipment of their combat units are more important than holding a foreign city, and will withdraw to preserve their force strength if they believe that defeat or encirclement is imminent. Examples include the Nazi withdrawal from Paris. 

It's worth remembering, though, that Russia has traditionally employed scorched earth tactics even when it meant ruining their own people's homes. It's unlikely they'll be squeamish about destroying a foreign city.

Yes they are less familiar with them and there will probably be additional challenges in maintaining and repairing them, in addition to learning best how to use them in combat, but even though the US isn't dropping off Bradley's Ukraine has received literally hundreds of other armored personal carriers, including a Dutch variant that has been retrofitted to be a full out infantry fighting vehicle with upgraded armor and a turret. Not all of these donations have been widely publicized or even announced, then all the sudden there are pictures of then in Ukraine.

Just pointing out they probably weren't given Bradley's more because they thought the M113's would be easier to maintain, maybe there are more spare parts around as it is/was a system used by more nations. There were more in general to give to Ukraine and it's better to try and learn one new system or maybe just the M113 suited what they needed better and is a simpler older vehicle.

So my conclusion would be - Ukrainian sources are possibly lying about things, but that's part opsec and part trying to preserve their lives by gaining public support. That's a goal I get behind. You'd have to prove that Ukrainian sources are lying to me and I will probably give a wider margin of lies a pass in order to support the overall goal.

Russian sources on the other hand are only occasionally telling the truth about their real motives, because I've discerned that their motive is illegal conquest. You'd have to prove to me that Russian sources are telling the truth and I'm likely to give their protestations of innocence (even if true) a pass in order to deny them their overall goal.",False,1653842545.0,t3_v036v3,t1_iafyhjz,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

I see why Russia is thinking that way, and it did work in 2014, but this isn’t 2014. Ukraine has changed immensely since then.

Russia is about to become the defender in this war. It might hold a slight air advantage, but the impact of that is becoming increasingly debatable.

The loss of equipment, man power and the degradation of another 10 BTGs is going to effect Russias ability to hold what they have.

If Russia is a sane actor there will be a point at which they need to stop and consolidate so they can defend effectively. Otherwise they might not be able to hold what they have. ISW is suggesting they have already reached that point (and I agree with them).

Instead, it seems to be all about propaganda and having “wins”. I don’t think Russia can bring themselves to admit they are fighting a peer battle.

If Ukraine can arm even another 300k (let alone the 700k they claim to have), then Russia is up for a bad time.

They are able to bear effective artillery fire down on Ukrainian forces, and it's chipping away at the seasoned units the UA stationed there. Right now, it's a numbers game.

Heavy weapons are what's needed most urgently, and they are built to defend against Russian aggression. Sending them to do the job they were built for instead of letting them decay in storage is the best choice for German defense. Russia is the biggest threat and so using the existing weapons to immediately disable that threat cannot be argued as leaving Germany defenseless, especially being part of NATO already. 

Germany has put themselves in a position of having propped up and helped Russia into this position through years of foolish Putin appeasement, they should stop whining about being expected to shoulder the burden while Ukraine is protecting all of Europe and paying for it in lives.

By the way since you danced around answering the actual question, Germany paid 40 billion euros for Russian gas in 2021. So this is literally offering to give 1/40th of what they give to Russia year over year. Germany is paying for Russian soldiers to go to Ukraine and paying for Russian bullets to shoot Ukrainians with. Yet it's excuse after excuse and stingy offerings, because they'd rather have Russia continue to kill Ukrainians than risk economic pain and they can't even be bothered to send real weapons that would help stop that.

Germany has done SOME things to help. This offering is helpful. But what they've done much more is fund Russia and help the Russian economy. So the criticism shouldn't stop until they show some resolve to shoulder some of the burden for the Russian aggression that two decades of German politics have opened the door for.

>Leontiivna did not give further details of what is alleged to have happened, but said that the report had been received in the previous 24 hours. Insider could find no independent evidence for the claim.

1 Ukrainian official told a reporter a story. He didn't give any further information, names, witness or anything. The reporter didn't bother investigating further. And ran the headline ""1-year-old boy died after being raped by 2 Russian soldiers, Ukraine says""

No one could argue this is reporting, this is not worthy of Facebook.

That can be scary, humiliating and provoke an existential panic about who you are. So people actively avoid it. If they are exposed to something which challenges their narrative they either deny it and call it lies, propaganda or just wrong... or they get angry and lash out aggressively or storm off/change the channel/click off the page. This can be seen like the ego defending itself.

I imagine the same kind of thing occurs with ideologies and to an even more extreme degree during war. The longer you wait to see the reality and stop supporting the war the more complicit in it you become in it, the more awful things you've found a way to justify and the more horrible things you've said about your enemy. So it gets harder to snap out of it and change your mind. Maybe something so awful happens which crosses a line for some people and makes them see reality or maybe they just keep on finding a way to support it. I think it's a bit of sunk cost fallacy.

I think you might have encountered some things even in early Duolingo, like...

- Vowel reduction — ""молоко́"" (milk) has stress on the last o and basically three different sounds for three o's are pronounced. Or simple ""она́"" (she) doesn't have a clear [o] first sound at all, aside from some dialects.
- Consonant devoicing is primarily happening at the end of words, but English doesn't have that (bed has [d] and doesn't turn into bet), and you may even spot the Russian accent sometimes because of people messing it up. As an example, ""код"" (code) sounds 100% like ""кот"" (male cat) in this form, though with a vowel added in a declension д will sound like [d] 'as intended' (but not with a vowel at the start of the next work, as with liaison in French).
- Words with unpronounced letters are somewhat scarce, but some very common and simple: you don't pronounce ""л"" in ""солнце"" (sun) or ""т"" in ""лестница"" (stairs, ladder).
- With completely surpring alterations I mean words where ""г"" that would normally sound ~like 'g' in 'go' instead reads as ""в"", i.e. like 'v' in 'voice'. These words are not just common, they are in the language core and old (which probably explains the thing).

The US is housing Gulen, who was accused by Erdogan of trying a coup. Gulen's not a politician, he runs a chain of prep schools, which aims to educate Turks and would properly be classified as a ""moderate muslim"" organization - the goal being, so Turks can have a well-rounded education and background aimed at becoming public officials, or working in international business.

Erdogan hates Gulen because his organization produced educated, competent, moderate officials to participate in Turkish government and international relations - all things an authoritarian isolationist populist does NOT want. 

That's why Gulen (who is fighting cancer and several other health issues) had to flee Turkey, and basically disband his organization. 

Erdogan wants the US to extradite him so he can stand him up for a sham trial and execution, and the US told him to fuck off.  Also warned Erdogan to not fuck with the NATO base (Incirclik).

I'm pointing out that their help is both less than what is asked for, less than what they're capable of, and SIGNIFICANTLY less than what they have given Russia year over year. Those are just facts.

I'm asking them to do more, and pointing out that what they are doing is not enough. We shouldn't pretend that they are being as supportive as other countries, because they aren't. They need to be pressured to do more, and they OWE it to Ukraine because it is their policies more than most in Europe that helped lead to this situation.

A few points 

They sent billions before January 2022, but that's outside of the scope of the diagram. 

You can't send military aid, if you don't have it. Germanys military is highly specialised and kept in low numbers. Countries who have enough supply of easy to use weapons (USA and UK) are sending big time, and also countries with ex-Soviet military (Baltic countries, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia etc) that Ukraine knows how to use. 

Then there is the issue that Baltic countries e. g. sent a lot of Javelins, each costs 100k $, Germany send Panzerfaust, they cost around 10k or less, ammunition being cheap to produce too. You are on the battlefield now, what will have a better impact 10 Panzerfaust or 1 Javelin? It inflates their $$$ aid in the diagram, while true effectiveness isn't measured by money alone. US weapons are just expensive asf, guess why the rest of the world can't afford them and buys Russian stuff, just look at India or Africa. 

Also aid per International organisation is kept out, while Germany always focuses on acting in unity with EU/NATO/UN efforts rather than unilaterally. The whole world wanted for decades a demilitarised Germany that is more integrated in the world and not a nationalistic lone wolf anymore. This is the result

You can see the ridiculousness of comparing GDP when you look at what NATO proposes for military spending, 2% of GDP right?!

Interestingly, English actually does have consonant devoicing, especially in England- consonants towards the end of the word are very frequently replaced with glottal stops, e.g. about or that, and also can change a lot in pronunciation based on what the following word is.

Blitzes and encirclements are both important strategic and tactical principles.

Your proposed strategy is also far older than you seem to realize. It was used with great enthusiasm and to tremendous tragedy several times in history by the world's most incompetent military leaders.

The most famous examples include the famous WWI strategies at the Somme, Passendale and similar battles, where massive long range artillery barrages lasting weeks were followed up by ""overwhelming"" attacks, with hundreds of thousands of casualties.

Most recently, it was attempted by Vladimir V. Putin, who has attempted to use it to take over Ukraine. While that campaign is ongoing, the strategy of firing massive amounts of long range weapons and artillery and following up with haymaker attacks of what is supposed to be ""overwhelming"" forces to shatter the enemy has not been particularly successful.

Regrettably, the Russians have had some limited success by bypassing and encircling strongpoints like Mariupol, turning what would have been a disastrous frontal assault into a very successful siege. 

Armies need food, ammunition and fuel. If you deprive them of these things, you win. Ukraine is too big to destroy its entire capacity to provide these things with long range strikes with Russian resources. Limited siege warfare, however can cut off key locations.

No. But all things considered, Germany is still top 5 of givers to Ukraine on this planet. So there are about 188 countries who as of yet gave less.

They need them, but they don't want them delivered (yet). Ukrainian soldiers are in Germany and training on those weapons, as we speak. Artillery requires months of training. By pledging to give newer weapons to Poland and Czechia, they were able to give some older stock that does not require additional training and can be used immediately.

But you know what, their economies are smaller so it doesn't matter in the media I guess, they are never in the news. That Germany only got 45% of their gas from Russia and now already reduced it, doesn't play a role either.
