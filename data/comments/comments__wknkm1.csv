Day 168 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, and the missile strike yesterday didn’t happen either, which is weird, this is getting suspiciously quiet. Yesterday at 5am an air raid alert started, we though that those would be missiles for sure, telegram channels even posted “missiles have been launched go to the safety” as they always do when missiles are launched.

But then no missiles came in the end, there was no reported missiles strike anywhere in Kharkiv oblast, so we think that was a false alarm. Another possibility is that all their missiles malfunctioned and fell in Russia, but this time we didn’t even get the video of missile launches from them, so I guess no missiles were actually launched, even though people in Belgorod were saying that they were.

Just 30 minutes ago, at 4:20am they finally launched their missiles at us, I’m pretty sure there were just 4 of them, which is how many explosions happened. One of the missiles landed in the city, others in Kharkiv oblast. In some weird way that missile strike put me a bit on ease, because that most likely means that they are not preparing something worse (yet).

Those satellite photos of damage from Russian airbase in Crimea are incredible; the level on destruction is just insane. So many planes destroyed, so much for that “no aircraft was damaged, and there were no casualties either”. Well, I guess you could say planes weren’t *damaged*, but completely destroyed, so they are technically not wrong? Russians are also saying that it is the doing of their smokers, and is definitely not Ukrainian strike, so no retaliation is required, which is very convenient for us.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 10 August 2022
 


- Russian commanders highly likely continue to be faced with the competing operational priorities of reinforcing the Donbas offensive, and strengthening defences against anticipated Ukrainian counter attacks in the south.

- To support the Ukraine operation, Russia has almost certainly established a major new ground forces formation, 3rd Army Corps (3 AC), based out of Mulino, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast east of Moscow. Russia likely plans to resource a large proportion of 3 AC from newly formed 'volunteer' battalions, which are being raised across the country, and which group together recruits from the same areas.

- Russian regional politicians have confirmed that potential 3 AC recruits are being offered lucrative cash bonuses once they deploy to Ukraine. Recruitment is open to men up to 50 years old and with only middle-school education. A Russian army corps typically consists of 15-20,000 troops, but it will probably be difficult for Russia to bring 3 AC up to this strength, given very limited levels of popular enthusiasm for volunteering for combat in Ukraine. 3 AC's effect is unlikely to be decisive to the campaign.

🪖  Heavy [fighting in Soledar](https://twitter.com/JulianRoepcke/status/1556969860474748929) on Tuesday with russian claiming it was captured (without proof) and Ukraine claiming all the attacks were repelled.  Soledar is a key city supporting Ukraine’s possession of Siversk in the Donbas.    [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1557179453809238016?s=20), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1557048723011772417.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1557141787948584960.html) have all the details. 

🍄 Of course **THE** news of the day was that Ukraine [managed to bomb](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1557047417626918912) the [Saki airfield](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1556986524385918976.html) in [Novofedorivka](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1557114404700823555.html), occupied Crimea.  This is way outside of Ukraine’s HIMARS range leading to much speculation as to how it was done.  (Spoiler, it’s [not ATACMS](https://twitter.com/mattia_n/status/1557016814986661895) long-range HIMARS rockets).  The big theories are [repurposed Neptune](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1557017053890060291.html) anti-ship missiles, Tochka Ballistic Missiles, a [prototype](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1557055253475901441) missile Ukraine has been developing, and my favorite — [HIMARS on a boat](https://twitter.com/auto_glam/status/1557017199595950081).

🍄 The occupation government of Crimea cordoned off a 5km restricted area around the base and damage was evident [even 1km from the blast zone](https://twitter.com/soldat31/status/1557077207176167425).  The social media intelligence crowd are still tallying damage, but it does appear **up to** 30 aircraft and an enormous amount of ammunition was hit.  Of course [russia’s story](https://twitter.com/Archer83Able/status/1557001342551482375) was that it was an [accident at the base](https://twitter.com/francis_scarr/status/1557030393802637312), no one was hurt, and [no aviation was affected](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1557077182110998528) (this is why I don’t usually include russian “information” in these reports). 

🍄 The airfield was by [a popular tourist beach](https://twitter.com/mjluxmoore/status/1557007927256530945) so there were lots of [pictures and videos](https://twitter.com/Euan_MacDonald/status/1556998724676722688).  The tourists tend to be residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg who have been [mostly sheltered](https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1554157473422000130) from the war.  There was a [mass exodus out of Crimea](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1557018273643905028) after the attack as the tourists will [now head home](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1557061408340287490) with their ~~war~~ special military operation stories that maybe things aren’t actually going so well after all.

🍄  Hold onto your hats people, “[It’s just warming up](https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1557005280017260547)”.  Gonna be a smokin’ [hot summer](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1557141905028399104) for the russians.

👉 An advisor to President Zelensky on Tuesday said that the [offensive in Kherson](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1556970921386196994) was part of a psyops/misinformation campaign.  However, this statement may be part of a psyops/misinformation campaign.

👉 The [exodus from Kherson](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1557101350441390080) is also progressing.  russians who were moved into Kherson after the occupation are leaving while they are still able.

👉  The russian installed governor of Luhansk said today that Popasna [will not be rebuilt](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1557134634152071168) as it has been completely destroyed and there’s no point.

👉 Over 1.3 million people [have been evacuated](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1557083889058856962) from Donetsk Oblast since President Zelensky announced mandatory evacuations.   Roughly 350,000 people remain, including 50,000 children.

👉 The russians are preparing to disconnect the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant from Ukraine’s electric grid and [switch it over to provide power to russia](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1557046593639030787).  Even at Ukraine’s [slow and leisurely](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1556355101995958272) attack rates, the power plant will be back in Ukraine’s control long, long before that process (expected to take several months) can be completed.
 
👉 Another Azov prisoner [was executed](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1556903806906114049) in russian custody.

👉 Twitter [froze the official account](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1557053209927188485) of the russian Foreign Ministry in English from August 5^th to August 12^th for [spreading COVID misinformation](https://twitter.com/masonrothman/status/1557144269860655104).

👉 russia didn’t like the news that Baykar is planning to build a drone factory in Ukraine and [threatened to “demilitarize”](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1556945233249705986) the unbuilt plant.

👉 The US believes russians have begun [training on drones in Iran](https://twitter.com/CNNFrancePR/status/1557174130314723329).  Should be fun target practice for Ukraine’s Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepards in a couple of months (4 more were recently delivered bringing the total up to 12).

💰The [Estonian Prime Minister](https://twitter.com/Biz_Ukraine_Mag/status/1556993595902672896) joined the growing chorus of government leaders suggesting the EU should stop issuing visas to russian citizens.  The EU has said that this is [up to each individual country](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1556964793797558275) and is not an EU matter.   Based on the howls of anguish on social media and troll farms regarding the proposal, it appears the worst thing you can do to a russian is to make him or her stay in russia.

💰russia’s budget surplus nears [$170 billion](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1557097547726036992) in six months.  High oil and gas prices helped increase revenues, however thanks to sanctions there was no place to spend the money.

For those wondering what weapon was used yesterday. Here's an article that talks about Hrim-2, Ukraine's medium range ballistic missile.

What we know publically it's that they basically had everything ready for test launches in 2019 and that they still hoped to acquire launchers as recently as last year. It's unclear if there were ever test launches though.

My personal theory is that in the past six months, they've probably gone full steam ahead on that program. If there was anything missing in terms of materials or equipment, I'm sure Western countries have provided that quite quickly. Ukraine has all the talent they need to develop such capabilities. They have a thriving aerospace industry, and with war efforts, I'm sure everyone contributes 200%. They probably cut out all the fancy stuff and made a missile they were sure was going to accomplish the basic objective, long reach and big explosion.

Now we've seen they can do that, and in theory their missile can reach up to 500km. So bye bye Kerch bridge.

Edit: I've seen people doubting their production capacity. Like I said, I'm sure they can just send some plans over to the US military and they'll have a bunch of parts machined for free under some special contact in a few days. Expensive doesn't matter in this case. Even if the parts have to be machined on super expensive 12-axis machines, they'll find a way.

Solid fuel is not too hard to produce. Maybe the guidance system and electronics are hard to produce, but even then the same concept applies, allies can help procure what's hard or long to get.",1660165584.0,1660163924.0,t3_wknkm1,t3_wknkm1,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

Except under very specific circumstances, or in one or two frames of a lucky video, you won't.   

Next time you see a jet contrail at 30,000 feet, look closely and see if you can spot the jet itself.  It will take you a while even though there's a white line in the sky pointing towards it.  That jet is huge, and slow.  And very hard to see, even if you know exactly where to look at the leading edge of the contrail.

Now imagine spotting something 1/20 of the size travelling 5-10x as fast, with no contrail.   At 30,000 feet it will be inbound, a speck 1/20 the size:  completely invisible, and coming at you faster than any sound it might be making... so silent...  You won't even know where to look, and even if you did, you wouldn't see it unless the sun is in exactly the right place to reflect a continuous glint.

At 1500 feet away it will finally appear about as big as that jet (and approximately as hard to spot) but moving so fast it likely won't register in the same way that the blink of darkness between frames of a movie doesn't register.  

Again, your retina *might* spot it as a flash of movement if you're lucky and far enough away.   Except it will be moving so fast you'll only have a fraction of a second before it creates a huge explosion thing that you definitely *will* see.

I remember right before the full invasion, I think it was a Pentagon briefing, and they were talking about what would happen when Russia invaded. They described a worst-case scenario where the government would have to re-locate to Poland or somewhere, but that they had plans in place to use Ukrainian soldiers to organize an insurgency. The way they talked about it made it sound like they were almost looking forward to giving Russia a taste of what it’s like to try and quell an insurgency that is being supported from outside and run by serious professionals. I think they even said that Ukraine would make Afghanistan look like a walk in the park comparatively with what they had planned.


When I think ‘partisans’ I think ad-hoc groups of civilians who band together to resist an occupier. But I don’t think that’s what’s going on in Ukraine. Some, sure. But I think that a lot of the ‘partisans’ are active Ukrainian military conducting a hybrid behind-the-lines war with the help of specific civilians who they already had established relationships with, had already stashed supplies and equipment, and had already made plans on how best to fuck Russian shit up.

I was prompted by reading **Zelensky’s request to stop giving Russians visas**.  But because “family reunification visas” trump suspensions in federal administrative law, US must first suspend granting citizenship under these scenarios.

This is not only a fraudulent misuse of the visitor visa process, but it presents a major problem in that the baby who has now been granted citizenship can have whole family then given reunification visas.

Rubio explained that now that it’s thousands and thousands, it’s too great for the US to keep track of whether their families pose national security risks.

[An example of this was **published just today**—Shoigu’s deputy has a baby that was granted citizenship by this loophole](https://www-unian-net.translate.goog/russianworld/u-docherey-zamestitelya-shoygu-nashli-grazhdanstvo-ssha-novosti-rossii-11936571.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), and thus very likely could himself be given a reunification visa.  This is a clear example of a possible National Security risk.  (“Over a 6 year span, prior to being appointed to the post of **Deputy to Shoigu, Krivoruchko flew to the US 26 times**.”)

This loophole—called “birth tourism” and exploited both by China and Russia—has long been a known National Security threat. It must be closed, which requires Congress pass a law for those entering USA under a “visitor visa” to attest that their purpose is not to secure citizenship for a child, and if they are, to be charged and immediately deported for fraudulent entry, and for the State Dept not to issue citizenship to children born under fraudulent means. (Note: this differs from other types of visas and for those coming to USA as refugee.)  Still, [other options exist](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/wiyz13/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/ijig892/) for Congress to have State Depart and CPD to stop or pause this fraudulent, harmful scheme.
____^^^^

Edit:  The **Supreme Court** of the United States in the *Wong Kim Ark* case “left open the option for **Congress to limit the ability of children born to two non-resident aliens [foreigners] to receive birthright citizenship** because of its focus on the parents being ‘domiciled’ and working in the United States.”

First of all, Russia has for a long time made it clear that its nuclear policy reserves the right to retaliate with Nuclear weapons in the event that is attacked with non nuclear weapons.

And **also in case of war with NATO** (which is exactly what this ""gossip"" is implying) Russia's only real option is to escalate to nuclear weapons in order to force NATO into some kind of settlement, since they clearly wouldn't be able to fight a conventional war against NATO.

The reason why Russia hasn't used nuclear weapons against Ukraine so far, and it is very unlikely to use in the future, is likely because there is simply no place in the battlefield where a nuclear weapon would change the tactical situation for Russia. It could be used as a strategic tool, to try and force the Ukrainians into accepting that there is no hope, but the problem is that the Ukrainians are already aware that the Russians have that capability, so i doubt that nuclear weapons would have a significant impact in their willingness to fight, may even have the opposite impact and make Ukrainians resist even harder. But the big issue is that it would make Russia's position in the world stage even more untenable, it would simply be impossible for western countries and companies to even do business with Russia, the sanctions would be harder, the willingness to support Ukraine with even more weapons would be stronger.

- the two sides live in different realities, due to the fact of consuming different media and social media bubbles

- social media amplifying fringe voices and conspiracies

- openly anti-democratic tendencies on the right, including shamelessly ""cheating"" in elections, e.g. through voter suppression and gerrymandering, stealing seats on the Supreme Court

- willingness to use or incite violence to achieve political goals (January 6th storming of the capitol)

- all this in a gun crazy country where everyone is armed to the teeth and where gun violence is already rampant.

Forgotten Weapons has done [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWdn6_ayqD8) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BZEu6cOFJs) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd98XcRm0bM) too. Probably more but he's got so many videos posted that picking them out of the list is a bit of a pain.

[Sub Brief](https://www.youtube.com/c/SubBrief/videos) (formerly Jive Turkey) will touch on the war as it relates to the Russian navy, but that is a bit few and far between.

Mentour Pilot (normally air crash kind of channel) did a [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcNYWZkWSLlpzbAOMUej5OF4RhoMDjZaS) on how Russian airlines would be affected and some other misc aviation interest.

[HI Sutton](https://www.youtube.com/c/HISuttonCovertShores) (aka Covert Shores) mostly does Twitter and website work, but his few Youtube videos are mostly Ukraine war related.

[Binkov's Battlegrounds](https://youtube.com/c/BinkovsBattlegrounds) was a channel that mostly covered theoretical conflicts, but has pivoted to mixing in some analysis of this war.

[Adam Something](https://youtube.com/c/AdamSomething) has done videos in the past, but has slowed down as the newsworthy events have slowed.

Historically it's been traded around between empires and states (2000 years as Greco-Roman client states, 350 years as the Crimean (Tatar) Khanate, 160 years as part of the Russian Empire or Russian FSR, and 60 years as an autonomous Republic or Oblast of Ukraine).  


Ethnically because of the forced deportation of Tatars in the 1940s, it was majority ethnic Russians, but culturally and ideologically it was nowhere near homogeneous as of 2014.

Here's a very good article about that:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/03/do-crimeans-see-themselves-as-russian-or-ukrainian-its-complicated/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/03/do-crimeans-see-themselves-as-russian-or-ukrainian-its-complicated/)

tl;dr Most Crimeans (even those of Russian ethnicity) would have preferred remaining part of Ukraine in 2014, BUT ALSO wanted good relations with Russia as their first choice.  Many would have preferred greater autonomy and the option for dual Ukrainian-Russian citizenship, but this was not allowed by Ukraine.  

If forced to choose in a fair election run by an independent third-party, they likely would have chosen to remain part of Ukraine, but this was complicated by the fact that Ukraine was slowly clamping down on Crimean autonomy and pushing for more Ukrainian nationalism (in part as a reaction to Russian interference).",False,1660156629.0,t3_wknkm1,t1_ijpn53a,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

Obviously they are rounded every day, but it's possible what they're losing in rounding down is made up for in deaths from injuries.  Russia's also killed their own people in more than one missile strike, as well as for desertion (or likely even from malnutrition), and those numbers can only be guessed at.  

The number of occupiers killed behind enemy lines by the native population is also not factored into Ukraine's numbers.  They merely take their intelligence report for an area they were striking and perform some sort of calculation between that and successful strikes.  

The idea that Ukraine's numbers are wrong by half or more just because Ukraine is providing them is...just not based in reality.  By all means Ukraine won't want to release low or negligible numbers, but they have, consistently, for weeks at a time during Russia's strategic pauses.  It's also to Ukraine's advantage not to blatantly over-report their successes, as they are still completely reliant on foreign aid.  Accurate reportage is essential not only in honoring the terms of deals already made, but to gauging the needs of the future.  

I don't want to take a guess at injuries.  We know far fewer soldiers are being allowed to leave the theatre now than in March and April, so many injured are still engaged in battle.  It's just less useful of a number right now.  

But dead enemy combatants?  Probably in excess of 50,000.  I avoid and loathe the excesses of hopium made here, but I like this figure.  I'd bet real money on it.  

However I'd add that there's no way of knowing how many of these are Russian citizens.  *Many* are rebels, many are impressed men, and many are mercs.

> 
>«How did you take Kherson? ""Stupidity or betrayal, perhaps both,"" says former governor of the Kherson region Andrei Gordeev.»
> 
> 
> 
>The article quotes that former governor, saying defensive plans included both flooding the region, as was done near Kyiv, as well as blowing the two major bridges over the Dneiper on the south side of Kherson. “The Dnieper, the Antonovsky bridge, keeps to the last, if anything, it explodes, and Kherson seems to be out of hostilities,” Google translates the former governor as saying. “[T]here is no bridge, we are just guarding the water line. Fuck him who will cross, the Dnieper.” 
> 
> 
> 
>According to Gordeev, all of these defenses could’ve been deployed in a single day. Instead, none of them were. Instead, the newspaper reports that “Incumbent Governor Gennady Laguta, according to colleagues, on the first day of the [special operation] put the keys on the mayor's desk with the words: ""I do not participate in this"" - and left the region.” Furthermore, “Together with him - on the first day of the special operation - the leadership of the police, the prosecutor's office, the courts left, and a little later SBU officers were evacuated.” (SBU officers are Ukraine’s intelligence officers.)

 >On 19 June 2018, the Russian State Duma adopted a bill that made education in all languages but Russian optional, overruling previous laws by ethnic autonomies, and reducing instruction in minority languages to only two hours a week. This bill has been likened by some commentators, such as in Foreign Affairs, to a policy of Russification. When the bill was still being considered, advocates for the minorities warned that the bill could endanger their languages and traditional cultures.

I genuinely hope Ukraine isn’t going to try reclaim all of Crimea, Such a move would be provocative and reckless at this point especially since they just managed to negotiate with Russia over grain shipments. Even if they want to take Crimea they should probably focus on restoring Ukraine to it’s pre-2022 borders. I know I am going to get downvotes for this but there were literally children who were injured in the explosion and could have died. I get this sub is pro-Ukrainian and the Russian army are a bunch of terrorists, especially after that nuclear power plant incident. but murdering Russian civilians (especially children) makes them no better than Russia since it’s Kremlin who started this war, not your regular Russian civilian.

When a projectile such as a shaped-charge jet hits the front metal plate, this generates a shock wave that will travel at high speed inside the metallic layer and then encounters a confined non-metallic material with elastic properties. Due to the lower propagation velocity of the non-metallic material, the shock wave diffracts and causes a brutal acceleration of the metallic back plate whose deformation is hard enough to cause lateral interferences that destabilize and shear the shaped-charge jet and consume it.

And...

>The two metallic plates in the NERA sandwich are made of steels of different hardness and thickness, depleted uranium plates were also tested.\[6\] Rubber and plastic were firstly used as inner non-metallic material but foam, nylon, polycarbonate, glass, elastomer and more energetic material such as Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) are also used.",False,1660154640.0,t3_wknkm1,t1_ijqyi24,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

[To understand the potency of those, have a visual comparison between the accuracy of Tomahawks vs Kalibrs.](https://i.imgur.com/HCbDZn3.jpg)

It is estimated that they fired off somewhere between 1000 to 2000 PGMs every 2 months. The newest offense (the actual war itself has been lasting for 8 years at this point) has been lasting for around 6 months. It is assumed that Russia will reserve its most modern munitions and stocks for self-defence purposes, so they will never let their stockpile go beneath 1000. 

So, we can assume that they are now keeping their emergency defence supply locked up and rely on production levels of supply. Problem for us is: We don't know what Russia's production rates for those are as they classified them starting sometime around 2016. They mostly wound down or even entirely shut down the factories producing soviet-era missiles, but about the Kalibrs (who made their first debut in 2015 in Syria) we know that their annual production volume varied from 70 to 290. Shoigu said they would increase that number by 5 times, but the man is a born appeaser and utterly witless at his job, so the fulfillment of that promise is questionable.

The point that i'm making is that there is nothing for Russia's leadership to think about it, their chain of escalation is already laid out in front of everybody to see, they just need to follow their doctrine, which for nuclear weapons, it would be expected them to do so, since if you don't follow your own doctrine regarding their usage it defeats the point of even having those weapons.

When you recycle an aluminum can it gets put into an acid bath and electroplated.  It is the same process as making new aluminum from bauxite ore.  If you stir up that acid bath it gets completely mixed at an atomic level.

Nitrates are often a main ingredient in explosives.  Making the explosive and not blowing yourself up would be the hard part.

Indeed, my understanding of ""separation of powers"" is that the Constitution keeps separate the powers of *the three branches of government* (namely the executive, the legislature and the judiciary) with each branch empowered with some ""check and balance"" against overreach by each of the other two.  

In particular, the powers of the executive (which *include* the federal military and police forces, headed by the President as chief executive/commander-in-chief: no separation there!) are kept in check by the judiciary (through judicial review) and the legislature (through impeachment).  Trump stuffed the courts full of ideological incompetents, and bullied the legislature into forgoing their Constitutional duties.  **Absent appropriate responses by the judiciary and legislature—*eg impeachment*—the power of the executive/President is in fact unchecked and without limit.**

It was always weird going to museums or battlefields in the south. The way they portray the confederate army and the battles are always with a weird positive light. Almost like ""the home team"" and a definite downplaying of the facts. Hell even when I was in school there the whole ""states rights"" was still being taught. It was just weird.

The confederate general refused to return Shaw's body and buried him in a common grave with his men as a sign of contempt for leading black soldiers. Shaw's father responded with:

So under Lend Lease supplies, vehicles, and arms of kind where supplied to the Allies. If those supplies were used or the equipment was destroyed it would cost nothing and the items would written off as a loss. The only time recipient owed any money to the U.S. under Lend-Lease was if the recipient opted to keep any arms or equipment after the war instead shipping back to the U.S. (shipping would be paid for by the U.S.) so that's what Lend-Lease was.

Under Lend-Lease the Soviets got from the U.S. and U.K. millions of tons of food, millions of tons of materials such as fuel, copper, steel, etc. Entire factories were packed up and sent to the Soviet Union, 18,000 combat vehicles, 19,000 aircraft, and much more were sent to the Soviet Union but one of most important things? A 3rd of the Soviet logistics base was provided by Lend-Lease: over 400,000 trucks and 1,900 locomotives. 

This is important because while some will say that Lend-Lease wasn't really active during the battle of Stalingrad which is correct but what they are missing is that Germany did not give up after Stalingard and the Red Army had to fight the Germans all the way to Berlin. During the time between Stalingrad and Berlin the Soviets had costly victories taking many, many more times the number casualties as the Germans. Without the logistics base provided by Lend-Lease one can easily say that the Soviet casualties would be much higher than they were maybe to the point were Germany fights the Soviets to a stalemate in Eastern Europe or in Germany.

Knowing a little bit about world history, the one thing that terrifies me the most about all this is that Russia (well, Putin -- *l'état c'est lui*)
wants to bring back the notion that sovereign land can be taken by force, that might makes right. The peace that we've known since then end of WWII, as terribly flawed and fragile as it is, rests on the bedrock notion that states have an inherent right to sovereignty, and that it is morally and ethically wrong to annex territory by force. We absolutely will not survive the 21st century if we allow Putin to usher in a world where bigger and stronger countries can just take whatever they want geopolitically. Ukraine has to stop him, whatever it takes. It's as close to a completely righteous and noble cause as we'll ever see in this life.
