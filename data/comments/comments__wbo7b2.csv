Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 30 July 2022
 
- It is likely that Ukraine has successfully repelled small scale Russian assaults from the long-established front line near Donetsk city in the Donbas. In the Kherson area, Russian forces have highly likely established two pontoon bridges and a ferry system to compensate for the fact that nearby bridges have been damaged in recent strikes.

- Across the newly occupied territories in southern Ukraine, Russian-installed authorities are highly likely under increasing pressure from Moscow to consolidate their control over the region and prepare for referendums on joining Russia later in the year. Russia currently classes the occupied areas as under interim 'civil-military administration'. Local authorities are likely coercing the population into disclosing personal details in order to compose voting registers.

Russia is ""running out of steam"" in its assault on Ukraine, the chief of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence agency, Richard Moore, has said.

The remark by Mr Moore was made above an earlier post on Twitter by the UK's defence ministry, which described the Russian government as ""growing desperate"" and using ""outdated missiles"".

Earlier today, the UK's Ministry of Defence said Russia was currently classing its occupied areas as under interim ""civil-military administration"" and local authorities were likely ""coercing the population"" into disclosing personal details in order to compose voting registers.

Day 157 of my updates from Kharkiv.

There was no shelling yesterday, but today we were shelled 2 times during the day, thankfully I don’t think anyone got injured, but the smoke pillars were pretty big, and they were visible in many parts of the city. They also didn’t forget to fire their missiles in the morning as usual.

This time there was not one, but two missile strikes. First one was at 2:30am, and then a second one at 3:55am. It will really suck if they continue to do a couple of missile strikes per night instead of just one. It would mean that you can’t be at ease and go rest even after a missile strike happens.

They fired 3-4 S-300 missiles at one of our technical colleges; the fire was really big and continued to burn until about 8-9am. They are still trying to fight against education for whatever reason. Also in the occupied towns in Kharkiv oblast they are burning Ukrainian school books and replace them with Russian ones. And then those same people are saying that they are fighting against Nazis, yeah right. 

They've got some peculiar methods of fighting against Nazis. Was pretty interesting seeing Russian embassy in the UK saying that all the Ukrainian POWs need to be executed by hanging.

>First observation is that, although we continue to see Russia failing -- failing on the battlefield, paying a high price for very little gain, and suffering domestic failures at home, I was really struck this week by how Russian rhetoric was trying to mask these losses, and what we saw was really very expansionist rhetoric coming out of Moscow. 
>
>A couple of examples of this -- we heard Foreign Minister Lavrov reversing his government's earlier denials that they were seeking regime change in Kyiv, and -- and he talked this week of getting rid of the regime in Kyiv. We also saw former Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev post a map on his Telegram channel depicting a Ukraine that has been swallowed up by Russia and its neighbors, leaving only a sliver of the country in Kyiv Oblast.
>
>And even as we have heard this really imperialist rhetoric, we've learned more about how Russia is (inaudible) in the areas of Ukraine that it occupies. The National Intelligence Council released a chilling report that described at least 18 so-called filtration camps, where Ukrainians are subject to inhumane conditions, including abuse, and in some cases, executions.

b071c04a2d36379888332de7acbccd1b,wbo7b2,ii8mip7,">The Biden administration has a plan that could avert this crisis. It would establish a buyer’s cartel — an agreement among Russia’s customers to put a price ceiling on Russian oil. That ceiling would be significantly lower than the current market price, sharply reducing the role of Western consumers in funding the Russian military. But the price would still allow Russia to make some profit, so that it has an incentive to export its oil to members of the cartel. Some of the key participants in the plan, including the United States, have banned the importation of Russian oil, but other nations that America hopes to enlist, notably India, continue to import large volumes of Russian oil.
>
>It is an audacious and untested idea. It also appears to be the best available option. If it works, it could deprive Russia of revenue without devastating the economies of nations that are trying to support Ukraine.
>
>Constructing a cartel is not easy. The United States has already secured the agreement in principle of the other members of the Group of 7, a coordinating body for the major democratic economic powers. American officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, are working with their counterparts to hammer out the details. The buyers’ cartel would be strengthened if other big buyers of Russian oil, notably India and China, could be persuaded to participate. That seems unlikely. But U.S. officials argue the cartel could still increase pressure on Russia by allowing nations that are not participating to extract larger discounts, too.
>
>Maintaining a cartel is also hard. Because the participants can benefit by cheating on the price ceiling, policing a price-fixing agreement is notoriously difficult. But in this case, there may be a plausible enforcement mechanism. A key piece of the new sanctions by the European Union and Britain is a ban on insuring tankers that carry Russian oil. Shippers need insurance to navigate canals and to enter harbors. European companies dominate the market; in April and May, 68 percent of Russian oil exports traveled on tankers insured by European businesses. That measure could be modified to ban insurance for tankers with oil purchased at a price above the cartel’s ceiling.
>
>The Russian government has sought to forestall the plan by warning that it would refuse to go along with it. “As far as I understand, we won’t be supplying oil to those countries which would impose such a cap, and our oil, oil products will be redirected to the countries which are ready to cooperate with us,” Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of Russia’s central bank, said at a news conference last week. Analysts, however, say that if a cartel is established, Russia’s real choice would be between accepting its terms and leaving a large share of current oil production in the ground.
>
>Perhaps the most compelling objection is that the price ceiling plan removes the stigma on Russian oil. Ukrainian leaders argue that the best way to aid their cause is to abstain from spending any money on Russian energy; a cartel would normalize those purchases.
>
>The world would surely be in a better position today if it had not developed a dependence on Russian energy. That is a tale with its own lessons, including the urgency of transitioning to sustainable energy that can be generated closer to home and the need to align trade policy more closely with other national priorities. The only lasting way to reduce Russia’s economic power as an energy exporter is to reduce demand for its energy.
>
>But those shifts will take time. A buyer’s cartel is a temporary expedient. After decades of complacent dependence on Russia, European nations are scrambling to adopt new plans to reduce energy use and expand sustainable wind and solar power. The war in Ukraine ought to catalyze similar investments by the United States, which is a net energy exporter but remains dependent on fossil fuel imports.

Others have called them ""in poor taste"". They are neither. Here's my response to such shameful commentary.
>
>Tankies, Trumpists & edgelords who have spent no time at all condemning actual atrocities in Ukraine say they are horrified by this photoshoot. If you knew nothing else about Ukraine, you'd think the only shots that caused damage in Ukraine were @annieleibovitz's.
>
>The photos being shared come from a profile of the Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska. The article inevitably discusses the first family's courage. If you have any doubts on that score, read Simon Shuster's detailed report in Time magazine about the first days of the invasion.
>
>As a 40-mile long invasion force was at the gates of Kyiv & western intel was warning Zelenskyy that an assassination team had been dispatched to take him out, husband & wife defied pressure from advisors & foreign allies to flee. They stayed in Kyiv at their official residence.
>
>The symbolism was important. Zelenskyy understood the devastating effect his flight would have on the country's morale. Since then, Zelenskyy has made repeated forays to the frontlines; his wife has stood by him, only venturing abroad to lobby for support.
>
>People are blaming the Zelenskyys for doing photoshoots while the country is burning. What they don't get is that it is precisely the Zelenskyys media strategy that has kept Ukraine from dropping off front pages and headlines.
>
>Audiences in the West find it hard enough to maintain interest in conflicts their countries are directly involved in; Ukraine is a remote concern for them. But attention is critical for Ukraine, whose military resources are limited, unlike Russia's.
>
>Zelenskyy has been translating that attention into tangible military support. He has excellent military leaders handling the war; his role is to ensure they have the means to resist a superior invading force. For this he has used every available avenue to lobby for more arms.
>
>The Zelenskyys have kept world attention from flagging. Through their personal courage and a clever media strategy, they have turned what everyone had predicted would be a quick rout into a disaster for Russian forces even greater than Afghanistan.
>
>So should the Zelenskyys have declined this coverage in Vogue? 
>
>Modesty is a personal virtue, not a political virtue. Had they declined an opportunity to explain Ukraine's crisis to a new audience, they'd be abdicating their responsibility as the representatives of their people
>
>So there is nothing—I repeat, nothing—wrong with these photos. But even if this was just a celebration of the first couple, it would be entirely merited. Because through their dignity and steadfastness, they have set an example of leadership that I hope more will emulate.

\- Of all the ca. 2 million comments written in these 275 threads, 50% were written in the first 9 days of the war.

\- Thread 1 had the most comments of all, by far: 36.6k. In total, Day 1 had 15 threads and ca. 190k comments.

\- Currently, the mods make a thread a day, closing the previous thread at almost exactly 6 am (CET) and opening the new thread subsequently.

You can't undo the latter, but you can admit it was not intentional.

788263b586c9c20dd1568e643749d730,wbo7b2,iiawg0e,"China will never invade Taiwan, period.

China relies on the West to feed it's people. Each year China has to import enough food to feed between 400 and 500 million people because they can't produce enough food on their own.

Where does this extra food come from? The US, Australia, and a number of other western countries.

As long as you can't feed your people, to that degree, you don't go to war and piss the west off.

That's it.

Second of all, look how fast the west dismantled Ruzzia's economy. It took them a weekend to pass the first package of sanctions, in the same week that Ruzzia invaded. The sanctions that came after did help, but the bulk of the damage was done over a weekend at the beginning.

Now, China's economy depends on the west. No west, no Chinese economy. That's it.

If the west starts moving factories, China is fucked, hard. All it will take is for the EU, for example, to subsidize companies that move their production facilities back home. And this is not really that big of a deal for the EU, if they really wanted. The EU, and the US, however, prefer to offload all these industrial processes - that pollute the fuck out the environment - to China. Let China poison its people, it's lands, it's air.

The damage that can be done to the Chinese economy in a weekend will shadow anything done to Ruzzia.

The Chinese government is well aware of this, and they took note of what happened to Ruzzia. That's why most of the help China provided to Ruzzia since the beginning of the invasion was moral support. And that was it. China is scared of sanctions.

Third, China doesn't have the military power to invade another country, especially one that is across water. It would be difficult to invade a country they share a border with, one that is practically an island they have no chance.

The idea that China is a competent military force is on the same level as Ruzzia is a competent military force. They use the same equipment, more or less, with China generally making copies of soviet crap, and China has no real military experience. At least Ruzzia was always invading someone left or right, but China has little experience with this, and none of it is recent.

China also lacks a navy. What they have wouldn't survive an encounter with the US navy, for example, and we are talking about two or three carrier groups here, not the full force of the US navy. You can't invade Taiwan when the US is there to defend it.

In conclusion, no, China is not going to invade Taiwan, and all they are doing is posturing. Talk is cheap, and talk gets others to the negotiating table, and China is doing more with talk than with actions.",False,1659214924.0,t3_wbo7b2,t1_iiaeify,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Don't get me wrong, being confused about this is part of Putin's playbook. He tries to use propaganda to get as much sympathies on both sides, specially if he can get both sides to fight each other in the west. On left wing politics he exploits the idea of Russia's Soviet past and his position as direct oppositor to the USA and the west (icons of capitalist values) to get sympathies on socialist governments and communist advocates (Venezuela, Cuba)... to fool them into supporting a conservative right wing movement. While on right wing folks he sells this idea of projection of ""strength"" and defense and renewal of 'old-fashioned' nationalistic values to earn the right wing's ""respect"" and support (Brazil's Bolsonaro supporters, USA's Trump republicans) and fool them into stuff like isolationism and leaving international bodies (WHO, OTAN, EU).

And when they haven't had a government that wasn't super oppressive and/or corrupt they have had weak leadership like Yeltsin. It's also always not been the richest country. Looking at St Petersburg and Moscow flatters to deceive as to how the average Russian lives, out east it gets pretty grim, the average standard of living is much lower than the western cities we mostly associate with the country.

Yes if the price of oil was higher in the 90's *maybe* they would have done better but they have always had poor and usually corrupt leadership. Chances are in the 90's with the oligarchs snapping up all the state enterprises on the cheap they just would have stolen any extra oil money too and the corruption would have continued till today more or less the same.

Edit: That doesn't excuse the Russians committing war crimes in Ukraine or their support for the war of course, just wanted to say that I don't think the price of oil being higher would have made a substantive difference to how things turned out.

You also need to take into account that there was a massive surge in violent crime in the 1990's after the Soviet Union collapse that scared people, things that no one would dare to do before like car jackings and public execution became regular occurrences in larger cities. Streets became noticeably less safe. Putin is a monster but he did increase funding for police and started giving violent criminals way longer sentences and throwing them in almost gulag like prisons in the middle of nowhere. He also tamped down on gang warfare that was responsible for a lot of this by making him and his friends the only gang allowed and murdering and imprisoning all his rivals. But he did this quietly enough that part of the reason a lot of Russians support him is that they associate him with not just economic revival but also stabilizing the social fabric of Russia.

As well he used some of that new oil money to restore Soviet era pensions to senior citizens that were either made valueless by inflation or simply stopped paying altogether, throwing your Babushka a life line after a decade of being pushed into poverty was pretty popular as well.

Best explanation I have heard is that central governments do not want regional or local governments to be capable of insurrection.  They also want the local population to depend on the federal army for defense.  If a region is lost the fortification become the enemy's defenses.  Soldiers native to a well defended province may resist leaving and going to defend a poorly fortified province.  In all examples the central government's position is weaker.  Politicians will gladly sacrifice the security of provinces in order to secure themselves.  

Many types of fortification are tourist destinations.  Think garden terraces and raised beds not berms and trenches.  Underground networks can be part of utility grids.

A $20/BBL tariff instead looks pretty good.  We settle down to a market price of perhaps $92/BBL.

Russia gets $72/BBL, so they're slightly better off than selling at a discount to China but still worse off than the no-sanctions regime.  The West gets a 8% discount on oil prices over the ""full sanction"" scenario.  The incentive to smuggle is much less.

As much as people want this to be true, and talk about it like it is, what the RuAF is doing in Ukraine isn't a fundamental part of Russian culture, in the same way that Aryanism or Nazism wasn't a fundamental part of German culture. Being highly prevalent in a population doesn't mean it's a cultural thing. 

Russians have had an unfortunate history of enservitude to a small group of people. It's easy to say that Russians culturally gravitate towards authoritarians and leaders, that they have a cultural need for a strongman. That isn't true pre-USSR though, as Russia largely followed the same revolutionary process as France did in overthrowing their monarch with the goal of installing a system that would benefit every man equally. The cause was noble but unfortunately communism was too extreme compared with French republicanism - enforcing the goals of communism required a totalitarian force to dismantle and rebuild the system, so it was really doomed from the beginning. Not for lack of trying though.

So even if it's true that Russians since developed a taste for strongmen, I'm not sure we can say a hundred years of history makes a trait inherently cultural. But anyway I don't think that's true because in reality, Russians really only had one actual moment of choosing their leader, and that was when Putin came out of nowhere. Not before, and not since, have Russians truly been able to choose their leaders.

Let's face facts here. It would require tens of millions of Russians rising up to overpower the immense and ruthless police state that Putin has erected. We saw that in Belarus, even millions weren't enough once Russia got involved. Unfortunately, too many are brainwashed to make that happen. There are plenty of Russians who I know who despise the war and would happily protest if the numbers were there. Protesting as it is would just be suicide. 

So we have two kinds of Russians, to simplify things: brainwashed, and those who know any protest will just be a wasted effort. That right there, in my view, is the problem in Russia. I don't think either of those are inherently cultural problems. 

We must do everything to isolate the brainwashed and those who perpetrate it. But for the ones who love Ukraine, who love liberty, especially those who took action despite the dangers, who went to the OMON guys and spit in their faces (which is far braver than anything I would do), who took themselves and their families out - is it right to say ""you are okay, but you are not allowed to call yourself Russian""? What should they call themselves? They have no other identity. 

In 1945, the Germans were defeated. Most of the worst criminals faced punishment, but largely the population - even many of them who supported everything the Nazis did - carried on with their lives as the Allies began their massive plan to rebuild the country (at least the western half). Eventually that generation of Nazi-sympathetic Germans died out and what we're left with is one of the strongest democracies in the world, who are very sensitive to anything remotely resembling Nazism. In 1945, I am sure that some thought the ""German"" identity should be erased, but the idea seems silly now.

>The Russians shared a massive land border w/ Europe whereas the US would have to ferry troops in from all the way across the Atlantic as casualties inevitably mounted.

The US already had troops both in EU and across the Pacific.

No, but taking out the T-34 factories in the Urals and oil refineries in the Romania would have had a substantial impact.

I don't know if that's true. 57% of the aviation fuel USSR used during the war was provided via lend lease, and cutting that along with destroying the Romanian oil production would have wrecked havoc on the USSR air force.

Edit: Actually fuck that, the US and UK wouldn't even need to use a nuke.

I mean, they beat every army in Europe, so they were pretty good regardless of your opinion. France was at war with Germany long before they invaded, so its not like it was a ""surprise"" declaration of war every time.

And nobody is claiming they were perfect, but certainly at another level compared to Russia.

> Yea invading countries that barely resist looks impressive

Russia had the biggest army in the world at time, and they also had the largest tank park, most airplanes etc. They also had the intelligence that they were about to be invaded. Plus obviously having knowledge of the invasion of France so they had some idea of how Blitzkrieg worked. 



And if losing millions of soldiers in a few months isn't complete incompetence then I don't know what is.

But Russia did plan for a blitzkrieg in this invasion, and failed miserably. It was a suprise attack that has been planned for god knows how long. They simply just don't have the organization, and they wasted their opportunity by being traffic jammed. 


And even western analysts are shocked at the incompetence of Russia's attempt at combined arms, like wtf happened to their air superiority for instance?


Their operations in 2014 were obviously much more impressive, and plausible due to the chaos of Ukraine being in a revolution, and it being a complete undeclared and unacknowledged surprise attack.

Holding a besieged city with primarily light infantry with minimal resupply capability is an entirely different beast than supplying all the armor Russia is rushing into the region.

Ultimately Ukraine is causing a logistics issue for those Russian troops, and Russia is helping them out. Continuing pressure on steadily worse equipped defenders will eventually cause the front to collapse.

It may take another month, but Ukraine is playing it slow by isolating, destroying, and logistically strangling the Russian defenders.

Certainly not. That was almost certainly not in the cards.

>All in all, I don't think the US ever really got anywhere backing 'friendly' dictators

We won the friggin Cold War. We beat back the reds in a number of countries, many of whom have still remained our allies. Imagine a Soviet-allied world spanning the Congo, Indonesia, Colombia. Keeping power in Ethiopia and Cambodia. This nightmare couldn’t be allowed. 

>Authoritarianism is the true enemy

You gotta understand that until fairly recently, democracy was the exception and not the rule in most of the world. In many cases it was absolutely not going to happen and the options were our dictator or their dictator. Naturally we supported ours, and it’s a good thing for the world that ours won out.

It’s the principle of Dictators and Double Standards: if you refuse to help the anti-communists because they’re dictators, the USSR wins out because they won’t have the same hang-ups.",False,1659200563.0,t3_wbo7b2,t1_ii9y5k9,,8,2,0,2,0,0,

Tell that to South Korea, Poland, and really any of the countries that enjoy democracy today because they don't have communist dictators. No, we may not have been able to save everyone, but the big picture is more important than whatever's happening in one country. It may not be all that better for Russia that their communist regime was replaced by a non-communist dictator, but it's better for the world.

And so we had to be sure we offered the better deal.
