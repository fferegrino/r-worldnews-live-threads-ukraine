Day 224 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, or missile strikes, but instead they used their Shahed-136 drones to hit our city for the first time. It started at around 2:20am, people from Kharkiv oblast started saying that they heard the distinct sound of that drone flying somewhere, and then the explosions followed, though we couldn’t hear them from where we are in Kharkiv.

We don’t actually know how many drones they sent at us, but there were quite a lot of them; I would say at least 4, but most likely more. Some of them landed in Kharkiv oblast, and at least one of them flew to the Osnovianskyi district in Kharkiv and landed there. Our mayor said that it hit some infrastructure, but we don’t know if there were any casualties or what was targeted yet.

The sound of their explosion is definitely much quieter than that of the S-300 missiles, as we couldn’t hear it from where we are at all, but that is to be expected as the payload is at least 3 times smaller at 35-50kg as opposed to the 130-150kg payload of S-300, which when it explodes in the city, you can hear from anywhere. Another problem with those drones is that while their sound is very distinct, they sound *exactly* like the big air conditioners mounted on a store just in front of our apartment building, so for us specifically, we cannot know if those drones are coming based on the sound they make.",False,1665017044.0,t3_xw02mj,t3_xw02mj,,0,136,0,136,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

4384a4aa052fecac046562fbc482e13c,xw02mj,ir4txkf,"There was an interesting and a long article published today in the Estonian media about the thoughts on Russia and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the stand point of our foreign intelligence agencies in the Baltics. The article itself is not in English, but I’ll try to give some main points as I think the insight was probably spot on and others may want to know it too.

The gists of the article can be summarised as:

- Russia has never changed. The tactics they used before and use today are exactly the same. When parts of Ukraine were kept by Russians, the intelligence people here were much less surprised about findings in Bucha, Izyum, etc. 

- it’s not just Putin’s war. The attitudes of imperialism, attitudes of “if you’re not with us, you’re against us” amongst the Russian population are widespread. Putin disappearing won’t change the society since the whole society has a problematic attitude towards non-Russian peoples and nations. It’s a harsh truth that many liberally minded people don’t want to accept and there are naturally people who are not like that in Russia, but in averages and commonalities, the average Russian person does not see Ukraine as a nation, does not see it as a nation state, does not see a problem with Russian imperialism. A Soviet joke/statement was highlighted as an example (in Soviet Union, Jewish people were mocked and not seen in a positive light): “one Jewish person is worth 12 Ukrainians” meaning that Ukrainians counted even less than Jewish people did, already seen as a negative group of people in USSR.

- “Putin talks like a russian street gang fighter”. There’s a longer part in the article, but it basically says that one of the issues why western intelligence - while still good at analysing Russia - can sometimes fail on Russia is because western intelligence people are the smartest and most intelligent, but with often a great educational background suit-type guys. Your average Russian intelligence - not a suit type of a guy. The Russian intelligence uses street gang fighting techniques, if necessary, the language and positioning they use can be something straight out of the poor kids street gang mentality. Putin didn’t come from a rich upper class intelligentsia background, but from a poorer impoverished “sharing a communal apartment and fighting other kids on the street” background, which has strongly influenced his politics and actions.

- Russian mentalities can be completely different, depending on where one is from. An example was made comparing between St Petersburg and Kronstadt on personal experiences. St Petersburg is often seen as the higher intelligentsia center, lots of smart suit type well educated European minded people. Kronstadt just a little away from St Petersburg is a whole different world in comparison, lots more dog-eats-dog type of a society. 

- Russia recognises only strength and power. It sees “win-win” solutions as losing - somebody has to always win and somebody has to always lose. If you win in a fight against Russia, it may start to respect you, even consider you a friend (case in point: Finland - my personal opinion). But if you lose or if you make compromises, that’s seen as you being the weaker part.

- Russia doesn’t see countries as states - it sees spheres and territories. If you’re in a formerly Russian territory, that territory is seen as temporarily lost and taught as such in Russian schools. A formerly Russian territory is a fair game because Russia ultimately has the right for that land. That circles back to previous point about strength and power.

- The Russian nationalist brutalist mentality goes back to Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. Ivan the Terrible killed and slaughtered plenty on his path, but retained power and showcased a strong leader. Peter the Great won several important wars, increased landmass and opened the window to Europe. 

- Russian people are willing to suffer. Putin expects Europe to bow down eventually because we don’t want to suffer.

Russia can't blow the main dam and still get water flowing into the canal. Even if they had the means (destroying the dam would be a substantial engineering project under the best of conditions), one of the man purposes of the dam across the Dnipro is to artificially lift the water surface up to the point that it can flow into the canal.

The control structure at the head of the canal is essentially a mini-dam with two massive control gates that move vertically to regulate how much water goes down the canal. The Russians can't blow this one up to ensure water going into the canal either. This seems counter-intuitive, but physics be like that sometimes. If the gates are destroyed, that will result in an uncontrolled inflow to the canal, but the canal is only designed to accept a certain amount of water (350-380 cubic meters a second). Running the canal much over this level, or indeed even at that level considering the inevitable maintenance issues, will only result in the water overtopping the canal banks at some point downstream, and rapid destruction of the levees creating localize flooding at some random point in Ukraine, with practically no water flowing further into Crimea. Further limiting this option is the requirement to pump water uphill near Crimea. 

Perhaps Russia's best option would be to wreck the hoisting equipment for the gates in an attempt to temporarily lock them in an operating position before abandoning the area. At best this would buy them a few additional hours of water flow, a few days maximum. In the case of cable operated gates, a few small explosive charges is all it would take to semi-permanently close the gates. On the off chance the gates are not designed with a fail-safe mode, the structure will have fittings to temporarily block the flow just upstream from the gates in order to service them. Typically those are massive blocks of reinforced concrete lowered by crane into locking slots in the structure. Such blocks are highly unlikely to be moved off site, and practically indestructible (The only method that suggests itself to me is direct fire kinetic rounds from a tank cannon).

Even if all those methods were to fail, the simple expedient of filling the area just above the gates with gradually decreasing sizes of rubble would reduce the flow to a trickle fairly quickly. Start by submerging some Russian lend-lease armor to give the rubble a base to build on, then it's just a matter of dumping big rocks, little rocks, and then local clay until a more permanent solution can be constructed in peace.

The first of these concerts was held in Istanbul, which has a large Russian diaspora consisting of people who left the country in protest of the invasion.[13] The other two concerts were held in London and Berlin.

19a24701e922248247d836a4bbc6d6d4,xw02mj,ir7u4u4,"Russia used suicide drones to strike a military base deep inside Ukraine on Wednesday, posing a growing challenge for Kyiv as its forces pressed advances in the south and east of the country.

The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said six explosions had been heard overnight in Bila Tserkva, about 50 miles south of the Ukrainian capital. Oleksiy Kuleba said the attack was carried out by Iranian-made Shahed-136 delta-wing drones, which Russia has begun deploying in recent weeks. Rescue workers were on scene extinguishing a fire and assessing damage, Mr. Kuleba said, adding that one person was wounded.

It was the closest drone attack to the capital since Russia began using the kamikaze-style munitions widely on the battlefield.

Smoke could be seen rising on Wednesday afternoon from the base housing Ukraine’s 72nd Brigade, which defended Kyiv against Russia’s assault in the early days of the invasion and is now fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut. The roof of a building in the compound had caved in, its windows shattered from what appeared to be multiple strikes on the facility. Firefighters marched in and out of the compound.

Dozens of uniformed soldiers, including some who said they had recently returned from the fighting in eastern Ukraine, huddled in groups across the street from the complex. Their barracks now destroyed, they said they awaited orders for where they were heading next.

The drone attack began around 1:30 a.m. local time, according to several residents in the neighborhood around the base, with a buzzing sound that sounded like a motorcycle. Three residents said they didn’t understand the sound signaled an airstrike until they heard an explosion, which sent civilians and some soldiers from the barracks racing for their basement shelters.

The fact that drones were able to strike far inside the country is concerning for Ukrainian officials.

People go into the military, then they find the horrible bullying conditions and after their conscription is over almost no one ever wants to stay or have anything to do with the military again. This results in Russia having a very sore lack of NCO officers like Sargeants, I think Colonels and those mid ranks. They only have, largely, top command like generals and regular soldiers.

Russia has been trying to solve this problem by making a specific academy for middle rank officers, which going from what I saw of the video, are supposed to be formed by the military that stay there and make a career over it. I also think it is unlikely to work, if you are going to go into an officers academy, why would you go to become a Sargeant? If you are already going to enroll into military higher education, you would logically go for the top positions, you are going to go through the hassle anyway.

This is also why a revolt from the conscripts leading into a march on Moscow is unlikely, the non commissioned officers are usually those that stage coups, they are the ones that are in contact with the rank and file of the army while the generals are usually at the headquarters and don't have much empathy for the common soldier. That being said, I imagine that the current war likely had a lot of people suddenly finding themselves into those mid ranking positions, with the catastrophic results in the field you might expect, but there is also hope of some uprising with this, assuming Russia cared to even try to create those positions for the war.

So believe it or not, one key aspect for Russian underperformance in the battlefield is not logistics, western intel or even coruption it is... bullying.

A day after Ukrainian forces reclaimed more territory in the southern Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, the jubilation of a breakthrough at this part of the front line was tempered by anxiety over an expected hard fight ahead.

Kyiv’s military here has pushed the Russians back by dozens of miles in some spots after struggling to advance for months. But after Ukraine’s remarkably successful counteroffensive in the northeast Kharkiv region, soldiers stationed near the southern front cautioned that the situation remains tense. Kherson is too important, politically and militarily, for the Russians to retreat as messily as in Kharkiv, they said.

“This is not Kharkiv,” Kostenko said. “There, they left all of their ammunition and vehicles and fled. Here, we don’t even have many trophies. They just retreated from the fight, took everything with them to their new position and are digging in anew.”

…

Cautious military strategy would call for retreating over the river rather than bearing the risk of getting surrounded or besieged in Kherson. But the Russians are likely to fight to hold Kherson because it is the capital of a region that Putin claims to have annexed.

The city and its environs would also serve as a helpful bridgehead on the western side of the river for the Russians, should they manage to reconstitute their combat power and go on the offensive seeking to capture the port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa.
“We think it unlikely the Russian leadership would sanction a full pullout from Kherson for political reasons,” said a Western official who insisted on anonymity to brief reporters about sensitive security information. “So this situation in the south could become increasingly messy with, potentially, a more desperate Russian force with backs to the river.”

**#NAFO and Winning the Information War: Lessons Learned from Ukraine**

Center for Strategic and International Studies ⁦: ([Registration link](https://www.csis.org/events/nafo-and-winning-information-war-lessons-learned-ukraine))

Wednesday, October 5, 2022 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm

Online-Only

Concerns about the scale and reach of Moscow’s disinformation capabilities have been mounting for years. Yet the war in Ukraine – and the online discourse surrounding that war – arguably demonstrates that the information landscape has shifted, and that new opportunities and methods exist for countering disinformation machines. Not only has the Ukrainian government demonstrated a masterful ability to shape the international narratives surrounding the war, so has the **North Atlantic Fellas Organization** (#NAFO). NAFO (official Twitter account: @Official\_NAFO) is an organic, ***online gaggle*** of pro-Ukraine supporters that has gained the attention of policymakers and global leaders for their creative use of digital media to take on key sources of Russian disinformation.

This discussion will examine several questions. What does the activity of #NAFO tell us about information warfare today and in the future? What broader lessons can be drawn from the Ukraine experiences? What risks arise from these kinds of information warfare, and how might they be mitigated?

**tl;dr**- Talking about Russian vs Ukrainian *names* for cities is reasonably accurate, but talking about Russian vs Ukrainian *spellings* technically plays into Russian propaganda

---

So a lot of European cities are really, really old. Like so old that the names have evolved with the various local languages, and you get proper *translations* of them, instead of just borrowed forms. For example, just like every European language seems to have its own form of John, like Juan, Jean, João, Ivan, or Sean, the Roman city of Flōrentia has a variety of names like Florence in French (and English), Florencia in Spanish, or Firenze in Italian.

The Ukrainian capital is one of those cities, even if it's mostly just East Slavic and maybe a few Baltic languages or West/South Slavic languages that have their own names. For example, if you go all the way back to Old East Slavic, which is before Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian split, it was called Киевъ, which became, among other things, Київ in Ukrainian (with Ки**є**в- as an oblique stem), Киев in Russian, Кіеў in Belarusian, or, as a West/South Slavic example, Kijów in Polish. And notably, this is just its name in those languages. So just like the Italian government will call it Florence instead of Firenze when writing things in English, the Ukrainian government will call it Киев when writing things in Russian.

Historically, because of Russia being the dominant culture and power in the region, if various Western European languages that don't have their own names for cities have needed one, they've borrowed one from the Russian language. But since independence, the Ukrainian government has asked that if we're going to borrow one, to please make it the Ukrainian language name. And sometimes, this can be *really* subtle. For example, Lyman is spelled Лиман in both Russian and Ukrainian, and the only difference is that because of a sound change in Ukrainian, the first vowel is pronounced differently. It's l**ih**-MAHN, not l**ee**-MAHN. (Sort of like how, because of the Great Vowel Shift, Paris is spelled the same in English and French, but pronounced differently)

However, you've probably noticed one little problem with this concept of borrowing a local name for a city. They use the Cyrillic script, not the Latin script, so we need to transliterate. And this is where those subtle differences like how the two languages pronounce и come in, because it makes more sense to transliterate the *Russian* name Лиман with an I as L**i**man, but it makes more sense to transliterate the *Ukrainian* name Лиман with a Y as L**y**man. (Enerhodar is another interesting example, where the name starts with the same sound in Ukrainian and Russian, but is written with different letters. It's **Е**нергодар / Ener**h**odar in Ukrainian or **Э**нергодар / Ener**g**odar in Russian)

> Side note: Had Russian not borrowed the metathesized form Владимир from Bulgarian, instead of the East Slavic pleophonic form Володимир, we'd be in a really weird situation where both Zelenskyy and Putin would write their names Володимир in Cyrillic, but they'd be distinguished as Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Volodimir Putin in Latin

> EDIT: Oh, and by the way, Bulgarian's historically one of the most significant Slavic languages, or at least it's the one directly descended from Old Church Slavonic

This just gets complicated, because transliteration is frequently an art, not a science. For example, the ISO transliteration of the name Зеленський, Zelens'kyj, might be a lot more precise and unambiguously reversible into Cyrillic, but you can bet English-speakers are going to forget where that apostrophe goes (cf. writing it Qu'ran instead of Qur'an) and assume the final J makes an English J sound. Thus, the official government transliteration is the Zelenskyy we've all come to recognize. And, well, there are also a few ways to transliterate the names Київ and Киев. The normal ones you'll see are Kyiv and Kiev respectively, although there's technically an English Y sound in the middle, so you'll also see things like Kyyiv, Kyjiv, or Kyïv for Київ and Kiyev or Kijev for Киев. 

But while things like Zelenskyy vs Zelens'kyj, Kyiv vs Kyjiv, or Kiev vs Kijev *can* reasonably be called spelling differences, Kyiv vs Kiev is not. It's the transliterations of two completely difference names for the city into the Latin alphabet, so it would be like saying Хуан vs Джон is just the Spanish vs English spellings of the name. (That would be the Russian transliterations of Juan and John for reference) Except it's a bit more insidious in the case of Ukrainian and Russian, because Russian propaganda actively claims that Ukrainian isn't a real language and is just a Russian dialect. So by talking about Kyiv and Kiev as just different spellings, where Ukrainians spell it Kyiv/Київ and Russians spell it Kiev/Киев, you're inadvertently playing into that. Different spellings makes it sound like it's a dialectal difference, as opposed to separate *names* in two different languages

EDIT: Умань. I found a city whose name is identical in Ukrainian and Russian. It's Uman' in both. The hard part is that you can only use the vowels U, A, and O, because the other three are written differently in Ukrainian and Russian, and you also need to avoid the letter Г, since it's pronounced differently. (Sound changes. /g/ is the normal sound, like ""ah"" for A, but Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn all share a sound change g > h)",1665005208.0,1664988709.0,t3_xw02mj,t3_xw02mj,,0,70,0,70,0,0,

>The Russian passport has long been a tool of soft power.  The current authorities in Nezalezhnaya are so afraid of our documents that they are trying by any means to intimidate everyone, and especially the residents of the liberated territories, with repressions for obtaining “enemy citizenship”.  From every iron they broadcast about criminal liability for a stable legal connection with Russia, they threaten with reprisals and imprisonment.  However, all this drug hysteria of the still acting Kyiv regime does not work well: the desire of Ukrainians to become Russians is steadily gaining momentum.  For example, in four years from 2016 to 2020, almost a million residents of Ukraine became citizens of the Russian Federation.  The number of applicants is not decreasing even now.

 >Meanwhile, the ""passportization war"" at times plays a cruel joke directly on some Kyiv officials.  After all, they themselves really want to be holders of Russian passports, but the position prevents them from admitting this publicly.  From the recent - a comical ""trial"" of the judge of the Supreme Court ""Square"" Bogdan Lvov.  The SBU charged this bureaucrat with allegedly possessing Russian citizenship and an apartment in Moscow.  Still, after all, the presence of at least something Russian is incompatible with the status of an ""orthodox Ukrainian.""  Whether this ancient Ukrainian has a passport and real estate in Russia or not is a separate issue.  It's funny in this case.  In Ukraine, one of the most corrupt judicial systems, every first judge is a thief, the judiciary is used exclusively as a tool in political and gang warfare, but the Ukrop ""law enforcement officers"" press their ""Servants of Themis"" not for this, but for a passport and a hut in ""  wrong place.""  The same Bogdan Lvov was responsible for the murky story with a bribe of one million dollars in 2015?  Or maybe he reported on how his wife buys luxury real estate, clearly not on labor income?

There is the claim that Dugin is ""Putin’s brain."" In reality Putin and Dugin isn't that close. There is no evidence that the two have ever met. Dugin has even stated publicly that he holds no power and has stated ""I don’t know anybody.""

This isn't entirely true though. Dugin does know some people in the Russian government but not the top. In fact the people Dugin is friends with have openly made comments against Putin. Dugin has also made statements against Putin. This group is more radical than what Putin is. One of these friends is Igor Girkin. Girkin has also said some pretty harsh things about Putin, like calling him a ""clown."" Girkin even said that he plans to create a party that is against Putin. Putin's assistant, Surkov, is said to have started a ""campaign"" [against Girkin and Dugin.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/07/12/all-is-not-well-in-novorossiya/) [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRhUMIPtVmA) is a video of a meeting that took place with Dugin and Girkin. 

The group that Girkin is a part of is supposedly big in the FSB. They believe that Putin isn't fascist enough and he should go further. Dugin isn't a leader but he is viewed as sort of a wise man, they believe in his ideas even if they don't take directions from him.

On the flip side in Australia 36°C is a pleasant warm day only above 40°C is the hot 🥵 and 45°C is unbearable. 

For Americans that's 96°F = pleasant and 104°F and above is hot and  114°F and above is unbearable. 

I genuinely think 15°C is cold 🥶

You get better at acclimating to the cold and heat with exposure. In colder climates people store more of their fat as ""brown fat"" which helps you stay warmer. Warmer climates will get you better at sweating more while retaining electrolytes. 

Worth mentioning Australia is massive about the size of the contiguous USA or from Ireland to Kazakhstan basically fitting all of Europe inside of it and parts can be cold as well but nowhere near as cold as other places.

Constriction is a method used by various snake species to kill or subdue their prey. Although some species of venomous and mildly venomous snakes do use constriction to subdue their prey, most snakes which use constriction lack venom.[1] The snake initially strikes at its prey and holds on, pulling the prey into its coils or, in the case of very large prey, pulling itself onto the prey. The snake will then wrap one or two loops around the prey, forming a constriction coil. The snake will monitor the prey's heartbeat to ascertain when it is dead. Contrary to previous belief, the snake does not cause suffocation by constricting the victim;  instead, a study of death caused by boa constrictors showed that constriction ""shuts off"" blood flow (and therefore oxygen) needed by vital organs such as the heart and brain, leading to unconsciousness within seconds and cardiac arrest shortly thereafter.",False,1665027787.0,t3_xw02mj,t3_xw02mj,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

IMO this looks like the US leaking info to try to reign in rogue UA operations. I think with all of the escalatory rhetoric coming from Russia, and Russia being in a particularly vulnerable position (read: Getting their asses kicked), it would make sense that the US is worried about additional Russian escalation / mobilization if they are backed into a corner. 

This leak will cause Ukraine to be a bit more selective with potentially ""over the line"" operations like an assassination. 

Let's be honest... it happened, and Ukraine was likely involved. Did Dugina deserve to be held accountable for her fascist rhetoric? Yes. Should Ukraine be involved in assassinating her? No, political assassinations need to remain a taboo act by modern states. Killing Dugina achieved very little, and stands to hurt Ukraine more than help. Those responsible should be held accountable, and Ukraine should prove themselves to be the responsible member of the international community they are going to need to be in order to join the EU and NATO. 

That being said... anyone who tries to blame Ukraine for this from a moral perspective or use whataboutism to compare them to Russia need to sit down and shut up. There is absolutely no moral equivalency between Ukraine's and Russia's actions here. Ukraine made a mistake during an existential fight for survival... Russia makes these sort of criminal decisions on a daily basis from the safety of the Kremlin. Ukraine should be reprimanded - but advocating for pulling support from, or even limiting support to Ukraine is absolutely ridiculous and anyone suggesting that is laughably transparent...

American officials said they were not aware of the plan ahead of time for the attack that killed Daria Dugina and that they had admonished Ukraine over it.

United States intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorized the car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, an element of a covert campaign that U.S. officials fear could widen the conflict.

The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, officials said. American officials also said they were not aware of the operation ahead of time and would have opposed the killing had they been consulted. Afterward, American officials admonished Ukrainian officials over the assassination, they said.

The closely held assessment of Ukrainian complicity, which has not been previously reported, was shared within the U.S. government last week. Ukraine denied involvement in the killing immediately after the attack, and senior officials repeated those denials when asked about the American intelligence assessment.

1. If Russia uses a Tac in Ukraine, will NATO seriously destroy their forces with conventional weapons? Do we really believe this has been communicated explicitly to Russia? Why would NATO make such an unambiguous red line that backs them into such an unpleasant course of action? Seems so irresponsible and at odds with the way they've held back and shown restraint so far.
2. If Russia believe this threat to be credible, then no sane leader would order a tactical nuke as it would bring NATO into a war they are already losing. I would imagine this is the only reason NATO would make the threat to Russia explicit (if they have, the fact that they have kept it vague publically makes me think they haven't). If they have explicitly threatened this through private channels then NATO is either gambling that he won't do it or maybe they are gambling that Putin doesn't have the political capital to actually take such a course of action? That, again, seems incredibly irresponsible. The purpose of NATO is to protect NATO citizens. Sorry but it's simply the truth. We can't be the world's policeman and should try limit wars not get involved in them.
3. If NATO did respond with conventional weapons, I would put the chances of it relatively quickly (less than week) escalating into a strategic exchange with Russia at about 90%. This would send us all back to the stone age. They could legitimately call it a threat to their state and all of their boogeyman stories about NATO imperialism would be justified in their warped world view. It would be humiliating to such an extent that they would have only one course open to them. I do not know why NATO would order this strike because the security of New York, Washington and London is more important to NATO leaders than the security of Ukraine. Harsh but true.

Surely the best course of action, if Putin did use a tactical nuke, would simply be to escalate sanctions to literally everything and draw a clear red line at another strike. Move to defcon 2. Send a fleet to black sea. Limitless military aid to Ukraine including tanks, armoured vehicles, long range missiles and artillery, aircraft - the lot.

It's not even clear how much a low yield weapons would turn the tide of the war (it won't) or even create much radiation. It would simply be another scare tactic and more desperation. The international community would be so aghast at Russia breaking the nuclear taboo that they would be a complete pariah and India and China would break ties completely. His own population would likely be horrified and would realize how much they have been lied to and how desperate and mad Putin is. He'd lose all political capital. You see today the bullshit he put on in international teachers day about respecting Ukraine. A first launch just removes all doubt within Russia that they are the aggressor and it would also scare the shit out of everyone inside the country including politicians. In these conditions Putin's regime could not last long.

He's hanging himself right now. We should keep helping that a long. I don't know why the West would give him a reason to turn lonely suicide into a mass shooting. The longer the war goes on the more done for he is - don't give him any reason to go out with a bang.

Essentially, he said that US Intelligence can [implying did] glean the intel through means that are right now hidden (the ol’ methods & sources routine), and that it’s of concern—and he emphasized this—bc Ukraine can’t do such acts and maintain its moral high ground, a position that has helped keep the weapons and intelligence flowing in. 

*As to your other questions:*

What I think people miss is that it doesn’t say that Ukraine did the act, only that an entity signed off on it.  So it must be considered that this was **simply an attack of opportunity**—someone had access to the vehicle, for example, not that she was plotted against as some prime target.  The article also clarifies that there’s different power centers, and from the USA perspective, they don’t always seem to be on the same page, not always know what the other power structures are doing.  I took away that the OP and military told US officials not involved and likely they were; while it’s stony silence coming from the security services (including intelligence apparatus), and since UA security services have had some leadership turnover this year, it’s likely someone signed off on it who’s not even still in that role, without telling military or OP.

Everything I’ve read about Prigozhin from those who’ve interacted with him, he pretty much has the opposite disposition and is unlikely to abide such juvenile antics.  Prigozhin is measured, meticulous, dedicated, blunt, deliberate, fastidious, thorough, and level-headed.  When he did the prison recruitment, the prisoners were surprised he went personally and would talk to them.  Several said he gave off an approachable air, not grandiose or tough as expected, and was more honest/blunt than expected (for example, telling them directly that most would die, maybe 10% could survive), which they appreciated as “fair,” meaning he wasn’t tricking them into going.  He’s also been in eastern Ukraine—so he gets out and about with his guys.  If it weren’t such a wicked, murderous, criminal enterprise, we’d be commending him for his servant leadership—which is sort of the antithetical to Russian style leadership.

If anything is the case, I would think Prigozhin wants credit for his efforts, that he’s more significantly contributed while Shoigu does nothing.

But also, Rybar said this around 2 days ago. I had assumed it was to quiet the criticisms generally.

As a German I'm very glad that things like that can change surprisingly fast.

Some years ago I was very interested in the history of WW1 and its causes. I read a lot of old books, most of them over 100 years old, written by the involved politicians and Generals themself.

One thing I learned was how different the German culture was from what it is today. It was very much not compatible with the modern Western / Anglo-Saxon or French ideas we (for the most part) have today. Instead of personal freedom and prosperity, it was all about service for the ""greater good"" and obedience to authorities.

For example, the Prussian land owners from imperial Germany (like Bismarck or Hindenburg) were in many aspects surprisingly similar to feudal Japanese samurai. (Japan was even called the Prussia of the East.)

A lot of this old culture was still there until the end of WW2. And this attitude was without doubt part of why Germany was so susceptible to the Nazi ideology and the people so willing to commit the most hideous crimes. 

But after the lost war the German people (at least in the Western part) learned extremely fast to adapt to the modern Western culture. And I think today even most nationalists in Germany don't realize who different our current culture is from what it once was.

Long story short, there is a good chance that Russia can change its attitude too. And not only in hundreds of years but extremely fast, if the circumstances are right.",False,1664973077.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir4txkf,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

And they had a severe dearth of skilled pilots(and the ones they had only flew a fractions of the hours NATO pilots do). So the RuAF wasn't all that well at the beginning.

Then once the war began Russia super botched up the mission to destroy the UAF and Ukrainian anti-air network. Russia never really trained much for ""Wild Weasel"" missions, choosing to use cruise missile strikes instead. Only they most took out Apt. building, Art Museums, and Schools. So rather than destroy the UAF they lost a good chunk of their inventory for little effect.

Then the mix of sanctions for Russia and aid to Ukraine hit. Russia lost the ability to manufacture high tech parts and weapons, or to acquire the parts needed for their planes and choppers. While Ukraine has been given those parts. This also effected Russia's anti-air capability with them running low of needed AA missiles.

Then around Aug. Ukraine and the US completed the project to allow Ukraine jets to fire the US HARMS anti-radar missile. Ukraine immediately went ham and started taking out Russian AA platforms left and right. Ukraine also used a method they are STILL hush-hush about to destroy many Russian jets on their bases in Crimea.

So now we come to the point where the skies over Ukraine are more and more Ukrainian domain. With Russia only performing a small handful of missions a day, and still taking murderous losses each time.",False,1664946390.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir453k0,,1,61,0,61,0,0,

Belarus, on the other hand, is way more tied to Russia and is expected to give in and help.

I'm cautiously optimistic but it wouldn't surprise me if a larger portion than expected of Ukrainian mobilised troops have been focused into logistics and supply and that we will see that begin to pay more dividends soon.",False,1664952317.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir429aj,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

So even if they dont slow down due running out of steam, they will need to take a break when the mud happens. I thin it happens until summer though. If what you say abot batches is true, then it only means Ukraine will take a lot of time until it runs out of steam.

Eventually all offensives run out of steam, Ukraine will need to consolidate logistics and at the very least get new ammo. That doesnt mean of course Ukraine can't restart the offensive after resting, but even the Soviets needed to take a break after Operation Bragation, which was basically a non stop stomping of the Nazi armies as they fled to Germany.

Let's be extremely generous and say Ukraine manage to continue nonstop until pre-invasion borders are achieved. Where do you go from there? Well, the other possible directions are Crimea, the city of Donetsk proper which would be a massive defeat for Russia as it would send the separatist government fleeing and the city of Lugansk, which is near the Russian border. Maybe the city of Donetsk is possible as it is near the frontline, but I think the other targets will require a pause, definitively for Lugansk, if Kherson goes horrible for Russia, Ukraine might gain a foothold into it but I think it is too big to be taken in one offensive without pause.",False,1664946618.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir429aj,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

This sounds surprising to me given how good at space stuff Russia has been for a long time.

However this article by Radio Free Europe paints a different picture : [In Russia's War On Ukraine, Effective Satellites Are Few And Far Between](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-satellites-ukraine-war-gps/31797618.html)

If I get the gist of the article:
- sanctions since 2014 have impacted the deployment of GLONASS
- They don't have many spy satellites 
- The resolution ain't great (50cm)
- Only some of these can see through clouds (radio)
- The probably don't have the systems to analyse the images and get the information to the battlefield

Because, beyond all the nonsense rationalizations put out by the Russians as to what motivated their invasion (‘NATO made us do it’ and the like), beyond even greed and self-aggrandizement, it seems to me what truly motivates the Russians is this: they believe Ukraine is just a part of Russia, having no “true” national or ethnic existence; their speech is not really a “language” at all, but just a backwards form of Russian. Putin has certainly said as much numerous times. 

Having no national or ethnic existence and lacking a “real” language, being simply a breakaway part of Russia itself, history demands in a manifest destiny sort of way that Russia re-incorporate Ukraine into Russia, regardless of the wishes of its inhabitants. They can then be taught proper Russian, adding to the march of Russian history into the future. 

Language is a big part of this. If Ukrainian is not a “proper” language, those insisting that it is are of necessity enemies of this unified vision of Russian history. 

The massive irony of course is that Russian aggression leading to the invasion itself is the biggest force ensuring that Ukrainians everywhere identify with Ukraine and not Russia, regardless of which language they speak. The meaning of Ukrainian nationalism itself appears to be changing as a result - becoming more focused on a vision of Ukrainian freedom and identification with being part of European, as opposed to Russian, civilization. Ethnic heritage has less and less to do with it - Zelenskyy himself is of course Jewish and his first language was Russian, but no-one would dare claim he’s not Ukrainian!",False,1664989874.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir65hba,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

That’s exactly what they’re doing while they still can.

As far as I know, it’s the Autumn that causes more difficulties than winter. The effects of Rasputitsa (mud season) are more pronounced in Spring when the snow melts, but can also cause problems in Autumn when rain makes the ground softer again. Also, Winter isn’t a guarantee that the ground freezes solid, particularly the closer you get to the moderating effects of the Black Sea. 

Take Mariupol for example. The average Average daily high in November is 5C (41F) with a low of 0C (32F). That’s a recipe for misery. Cold rain, wet snow, Snowmelt, freeze-thaw, icy roads, etc. Also, you need prolonged cold for the ground to properly freeze - you may be able to move on foot easily enough, but if you take a tank or heavy weaponry into a field, you may punch right through that hard top layer into soft muck beneath.

I don’t think Ukraine will completely stop gaining ground, but it does become much harder to advance in inclement conditions. We may see a continued push until mud/weather becomes problematic, followed by a pause to wait for things to firm up, and then another push. This may repeat several times depending on the weather.

There’s also the human element. It’s just much harder to do stuff in cold weather. Harder to walk through snow, more calories to consume, harder to dig trenches. More time and effort needs to be spent just keeping soldiers fed and alive.

Disclaimer: Just my uneducated musings. I know nothing about military strategy, but have spent a lot of time in rainy, muddy, frozen fields. Moving in them is not fun.

Read the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power) on the term and see what you think. Myself, I think overall no, but in some ways yes. 

Ukraine lacks both the population and economy to be a traditional regional power. The region it is a part of is not well defined either. What region would it be the power of? It does not have the benefit of tradition either. No one is used to looking to Ukraine for leadership, it's been a part of someone else sphere of influence or just straight up part of another state. Ukraine doesn't form the nexus for Romanian and Hungarian politics the way Germany does for Czechia and Poland. Nor is Ukraine likely to be able to gain this status. The EU really cocks up the traditional spheres of power and influence that regional powers rely on to gain status. Poland cares a lot more about what Brussels thinks and does than it ever will about Ukraine, because the union is the most powerful and relevant political entity for its member states. 

However, this is where Ukraine might become a sort of regional power. If Ukraine joins the EU it will shift the balance of power east and be a significant voice for the CEE part of the union. It's likely higher than average militarization will also give it more weight that simple economic and population would indicate. It's not going to ever challenge Germany for economic or political leadership in the bloc, but if it's got the biggest and most active military in the union, and uses it, it's going to matter. If you put the boots on the ground for a peacekeeping operation, you get a seat at the big boy table.

It's not going to be a regional power, but it may be a power within the EU. In the same way that Texas isn't a regional power in international politics, but it is a regional power within the US.",1664967290.0,1664959138.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir4e4wk,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

If it's about projecting power beyond your borders, probably not. They're going to be too busy with reconstruction in the next 5-10 years, and a substantial part of what they're achieving is only possible with massive NATO assistance.

If it's about geopolitical influence, yeah surely. Zelensky has put them squarely in any conversations concerning Eastern Europe for the forseeable future. And they've caused such a ripple effect just in NATO alone that it's unlikely to be forgotten any time soon, as well as the abrupt shift of Europe away from Russian petroleum. They've deepened diplomatic ties with a number of Eastern European countries like Poland, the Baltics, Turkey, etc. Crazy to think of this being a key moment in the development of the identity of a thousand-year old nation, but here we are.

We were in the middle of trying to convince them that we didn't have to be outright enemies!

Not everything that's said publicly is meant for your ears only. Romney wasn't necessarily *wrong*, but it was an unwise thing to say considering the situation at the time.

It might have even been harmful to our relationship, as Putin now had to fear that whatever deals he made with Obama and however much effort he put into it, the next president would turn it all upside down and screw him over.

Putin was already upset with the ways things had gone under Bush, hence the 'reset' under Obama. The fact that the foreign policy of the most powerful country in the world could switch back and forth so dramatically from one administration to the next is not reassuring to other countries, either friend or foe.

I saw below you're asking about Kherson City vs Kherson Oblast. There's a 100+ mile long front line, and 2,000 square miles of territory filled with Russian defensive positions between the Ukrainian army and the city.

This *should* go without saying, but the Ukrainians have to go through that territory in order to capture the city. The serious answer to your question is that this takes time.

In the last month, they've been bombing ammo dumps and supply routes. In the last week, they routed Russians from dozens of towns over a 300 square mile chunk.

The die has been cast at this point... maybe in an alternate reality, a less belligerent, less corrupt Russia might have built up a credible military and credible alliances such that they could influence global norms, and challenge NATO for control of whatever ""sphere of influence"" they feel entitled to.  
  
But that is not the world we live in.  Russia has first of all made itself such a pariah that it has basically no soft power available on which to even build a rhetorical case for what it is trying to do. It's only alliances are with other countries who would openly seek to destroy the world (if they could) before aligning themselves with basic democratic norms which drive the unprecedented peace and prosperity of our era.  Secondly, Russia has failed to deploy credible military hardware, or credibly conduct warfare against a much weaker opponent.  This is because they have built a corrupt society which stands on outdated, toxic ideals about masculinity, ""traditional"" values, and power structures.  The entire point of this exercise, as stated, is to remake the world order in their image  They believe, among other things, that power emerges from might and conquest, and they have placed this ideology on trial, only to have it eviscerated by the ""soft"" western liberalism which infuriates them so much.  
  
The simple answer here is that they gambled in Ukraine and they lost, and now the history books will show that Putin is simply another autocrat who got high on his own shit, and died by his own hubris.  If Russia could do more than what they are doing now, they would have done it already.  Ukraine was meant to be their ideological beachhead from which they would grow the maximalist Russian bear into a global power once again, but it was always doomed to fail.  Ironically, because they made no contingency for failure.  Once they could not take Kyiv, they should cut their losses, analyzed their failures, and formed a new plan.

There was, essentially, no German state for close to a decade, if we consider that the allies had control of various parts of modern Germany. Germany didn’t change because it realised what it had done was wrong, at least it wasn’t the only reason - the reason was also that the allied forces took control of the state and forced people through a denazification program, for one, and then rapid onset of the Cold War geopolitical (and economic - largest energy resources in Europe were in Germany AFAIK) realities brought Germany back into the fold of Western Europe as a second. 

I watched the “World at War” docu series a while ago and they had interviews with regular Germans and some high ranking Nazi officials too (that survived, ofc). These people spoke very calmly about what was the objective of Nazi state and how life was for an average citizen etc. It’s a marvellous docu series, probably one of the best when it comes to WWII, but in their descriptions, the way they talked about Nazi state prior to war… it sounded completely normal from their mouths. At least I recall it being like that, it’s been a while since I watched it. 

And - Germany honestly repented and apologised and has learned a deep lesson; to a degree that maybe it was slightly naive towards Russia (even if we consider WWII and residual guilt about it towards Soviet Union). Russia, as the successor state, has never apologised nor atoned for what it did and has done.

>According to cold war historian John Lewis Gaddis, who was interviewed about the Korean War for a 1999 PBS documentary “American Experience: Race for the Superbomb,” the role of the atomic bomb was undefined. “It’s one of the biggest dogs that did not bark in the entire cold war,” says Gaddis. “There was no clear strategy worked out ahead of time for what the role of nuclear weapons in the limited war would be. You’re talking about a war, particularly after the Chinese intervene, with peasants coming down mountain trails carrying everything on their backs. And this was simply not what the atomic bomb had been built for. ***The only way that you can make the atomic bomb credible is precisely by not using—by keeping it out there as a kind of mysterious, awesome force. That to use it would actually cheapen it somehow.”***

With Putin it's a predictable way down. You know what to expect of him, and you know that every day will be worse, but it'll be worse in ways you expect, save a few hiccups. When Putin goes, all there will be left is hiccups, and *that* is when you really start keeping your head down, because if you pop it up, you won't even know where you'll be shot at from, or by whom. The only real way to survive this is to lie down as flat as possible.

The *other* alternative is that the new leader won't have the 20 years of cult of personality. Perhaps people won't be as docile. Thing is, if you think that they'll have riots for freedom, you'd be wrong. With a new leader in place, they will have to immediately prove themselves to people whose proverbial home's on fire. There won't be a democracy because the reason why dictatorships rise is because there are fires in the country and people want the fire to be put out *right fucking now,* they don't want to bicker in front of their burning house about how to put the fire out while their entire lives go out in flames. Democracy cannot survive low quality of life, because people suffer every day, and dictators are able to make decisions quickly, or at the very least con people into thinking that it's not as bad. Democracy is slow. It's a 'rich country's' government, where the political process can afford to take time to play itself out.

You forget. The pro-West people are a minority, and the pro-Russia people a loud and cruel majority who have no scruples about screwing others up to get their way. This segment of a population exists in every country, but in Russia this segment's beliefs and actions are incentivised by the government itself. And between protesting (violently or non-violently), then losing your children when they throw you in a penal colony whilst your children are put up in the Russian foster system, and keeping your head down and keeping your family intact, most people are going to choose family.

Russia is sending the least burdened (likely no children, no other dependents) to slaughter. What remains is the burdened (dependents) and women (never stand a chance against a policeman that's getting physical. Also, what waits her in custody is almost always much worse than what waits a guy), kids and elderly. Russian government is doing what every oppressive government does: neutralising its unburdened young and middle-aged male citizens either by killing them or giving them something to lose and/or to feel superior to (in many parts of Middle-East, it's women and children). And I'm not downplaying the power of a woman rebel, but being a woman myself, I know full well that I will not outrun or outfight an armed policeman. Every time I'd be out there, I'd literally be playing Russian roulette. I'm not sure if I was willing to commit suicide for my country, or for anybody else except immediate family.

You dig, you lay down ladders, you push, you winch… and you get through. It’s exhausting work, but it can be done… IF you’re motivated and determined, and in good physical condition. 



To me that means that the mud will slow the Ukrainians down a lot, but it will bring the Russians to a grinding halt. That would mean that the mud would give Ukraine even more of an advantage. If the Russians are unable to move at all, they are going to be sitting ducks, while the Ukrainians would still be able to move, even if slowly.



The worse the conditions, the more of an advantage the better-equipped army has. Do the Russians even have ladders? (mud ladders, made for getting equipment out of the mud).

However, the crown itself is solid gold alloy, not some other material plated with gold (if that's what you meant). Mostly gold and other noble metals and some other stuff. One of the reasons gold does such a good job is it closely mimics the hardness of enamel, so wears away at a similar rate and keeps your bite even.

Okay, so believe it or not, there was actually a time in the history of the Slavic languages where they not only avoided a lot of consonant clusters, but even had a rule against syllables ending in a consonant. (N, M, L, and R were vaguely exceptions, but I'm not going to get into that) Additionally, palatalization was and still is a really big deal, where a lot of consonants get hard and soft forms. Normally this is roughly adding a Y, although it can also be palatalization, like S vs SH. So for a variety of reasons, Cyrillic developed a system where you more or less have pairs of letters for each vowel sound based on whether they come after a hard or a soft consonant. Except these two sounds called the yers/jers more or less got so short that they vanished completely, leaving behind all the impressive consonant clusters the Slavic languages are famous for. However, consonants could still be hard or soft, so even though they didn't actually make a sound anymore, the letters Ъ and Ь were still used as ""dummy"" vowels to indicate whether a consonant was hard or soft when there *wasn't* a vowel after it. To compare it to English, it's sort of like how the silent E in ""dance"" doesn't actually impact the sound the A makes, but it still indicates that it's a soft C and makes an S sound, not a K sound.

So at least in East Slavic, everyone still uses the letter Ь, which, if it gets reflected in transliteration, typically becomes an apostrophe, to indicate that a consonant is soft. So looking at the name Зеленс**ь**кий for an example, it means there's technically a hint of a Y sound in the middle there.

But then... there's the hard sign. Russian actually *does* still need it, since it makes a three-way distinction of hard, hard+/j/, and soft. So even though they decided it was silly to require it at the ends of words, because if a consonant isn't soft, it must be hard (no, seriously, there was an actual spelling rule in Russian at one point that you couldn't end a word with a consonant letter), and got rid of that in a spelling reform, it still shows up in the middle of some words where they need to write hard+/j/. Meanwhile, Ukrainian doesn't *technically* need it, because they don't distinguish between hard+/j/ and soft, but they still mark a few consonants as technically-still-hard. It's just that Ukrainian completely abandoned the hard sign and just uses an apostrophe instead, like in the word for ""five"", п**'**ять. But in both cases, the usual transliterated form is a *double* apostrophe, like p''jat'. 

So basically:

* Apostrophe in the Latin alphabet- add an extra /j/ (English Y sound)

* Apostrophe in the Cyrillic alphabet- mostly just there in a few words for historical reasons, even though it does even less than silent E in English

EDIT:

Actually, I'd like to clarify that ""they got so short that they vanished completely"" isn't me simplifying things. It's more or less exactly what happened. I mean, I'm still simplifying in that I didn't talk about things like strong, weak, and tense jers. But that part, at least, is one of those rare moments when the actual explanation sounds like you're ELI5'ing it

EDIT: Also, if you speak Polish, it's like how the genitive of Wrocław is Wrocław**i**a, but the genitive of Kraków is Krakowa, no -i-. The soft sign would be like adding an apostrophe to Wrocław' as a reminder that you add an -i- before endings and use soft endings",1664999744.0,1664991844.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir6asdn,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Arabic is up there with Chinese on the list of ""Things that aren't actually singular languages, but people talk about as singular languages"". Basically, because speaking Arabic is a major part of Muslim identity, there's a big cultural push to all speak *Arabic*. It would be like if Europeans tied speaking Latin to Christian identity and various countries like Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy all insisted they still speak Latin, potentially even teaching something like [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua) as a standardized dialect. This is also where you get into the Maltese question. *Technically* it actually descends from Siculo-Arabic, not Classical Arabic, but for all intents and purposes, it's basically just the one Arabic ""dialect"" that people actually recognize as its own language, because it's spoken by Maltese *Christians*, not Muslims. To continue the Romance analogy, it would be like if people recognized [Ladino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaeo-Spanish) as its own language because of it being spoken by Jews, not Christians.

AFAIK no one in NATO has come out and said ""if Putin does x, we will do and we've told him this"". I've been hearing implicit yet still ambiguous threats. If you have other sources please let me know.

>B) any use of any tactical nukes means the defensive of MAD is broken by a rabid dog. The only thing you can do with a rabid dog is put it down

This is an incredibly stupid thing to say and I can only assume you do not realize what is at stake.

What does NATO achieve strategically by destroying what is left of Russia's armies before the Ukrainians do it themselves? Are these limited strategic aims worth risking  the deaths of millions of your own citizens for? Think about it - if you are entering into armed conflict with a nuclear power you need to.

>how many nukes can reasonably be launched and not defended before either side is forced into a surrender and 2) the effectiveness of them. Yes you can kill alot of people in built up areas, and fallout sucks, but there are not enough in existence to take the world 'back to the stone age' . Yeah it would be a very unpleasant time for some places, others would be largely unscathed.

A lot of nukes can be launched and detonated before being intercepted and yes a full scale nuclear exchange would be catastrophic for 100's of millions of people globally. The entire global supply chain and economy would cease to exist. Every population centre would experience deaths in the 100's of thousands and injuries 10 times that.

Even a limited strategic exchange (if it could somehow be restricted to that) would destroy the economy and cause the deaths of millions.

I live in a built up area and don't want to immediately risk the death of my loved ones and everyone I know because Putin launches a low-yield tac nuke at a random farm in southern Ukraine in some pathetic dick measuring exercise before he finally fucks off.

The response will be swift, and through.  Sunken submarines, damaged ICBMs and aircraft can't launch counter attacks.  Poorly maintained ICBM's and aircraft can't launch counter attacks. 

Pretty sure Russia would overtly signal strategic nuclear readiness and put all their boats to sea before using the nuke on Ukraine. Any attempt at a first strike on their triad in such a scenario would be completely redundant. Even if we somehow took out most of their retaliation (we can't, as far as I know) it would lead to (at the very least) millions of deaths in NATO countries and Russia and the collapse of the global economy.

>Putin knows this, he knows that he'll need to launch all the nukes, launch them first, and initiate MAD. And freaks him out too, because he doesn't know if that order will be followed, or if his stockpiles are up to snuff, or if he can pull off a coordinated strike before NATO knows what's up.  
Putin's acting like he's got the ace of spades in the hole, but really he's got bubkis.

I hope this is true but I don't want to put this theory to the test if they use a low-yield nuke on some farm in southern Ukraine or in the black sea. There are still levels of escalation NATO can lever without directly involving themselves in the conflict militarily.

We could provide limitless aid to Ukraine in terms of tanks, aircraft and long range missiles and (believe or not) there are still sanctions that could be imposed - especially if an alarmed broader international community involving countries like China and India backed them (which I believe they would if Putin went Nuclear).

There were videos of trenching equipment rolling through Svatove a few days ago, but I'm not sure how quickly they'll be able to establish effective defensive lines.

>  The ""encirclements"" may have been in part to bypass trenches and bunkers. If the Russian line crumbles enough Ukraine might just attack places because Russians are in those places. 

They absolutely were, you're right. Ukraine realized it made no sense to try to attack the strongholds in cities and towns when they could find weak points, go around them, and threatened encirclement. That meant Russians had to choose to be encircled or abandon their strongholds without a fight. It was a success in Balakliva, Izyum, and Lyman.

> What you wrote and drew on the map makes sense. But also makes sense to the Russians. What if Ukraine can just steamroll Russian Army units? That might eliminate any hope of establishing a new defensive line.

Russia probably sees that same vulnerability, but their defensive lines in both the east and south have relied on heavily-defended anchor points in cities/towns connected with weak defenses between them. Ukraine finds that weak point and pushed through it. So I'm not saying an attack on Svatove *can't* work, just that Ukraine has avoided it so far.

I too worked in vet medicine for a while. The worst job I ever had was pulling hundreds of writhing maggots from the flesh of a (barely) living, badly mauled cat. Every wound was crawling with them,  just like this soldier's arm.

I was told to drop them in a bowl of flea & tick dip concentrate. That stuff would kill a large animal if you used it undiluted. The maggots swam around in it like they were on holiday. 40 years later and I still shudder at that memory. 

It took four hours to get them all. The cat actually lived, though we kept her for nearly three weeks to be safe.  If that soldier doesn't lose his arm I'd be somewhat surprised.

In a way, your lawful vs chaotic D&D alignment comparison isn't entirely off, but it's less that China is lawful therefore limits corruption, and more that China is lawful and therefore has more organized, systemic corruption.

China's issues are a combination of extreme ambition combined with a culture of ""good enough"". They desperately wanted to become a modern, urban, industrialized society, so they implemented social and economic policies designed to engineer society toward that goal. This allowed them to expand and grow at unprecedented rates, but a large part of that was because they ignored all of the hard work and due diligence needed to get there. Do some research in to the Chinese real estate market and how it relates to their governmental policies and economic culture.

The same thing applies to their military. They decided they needed a navy that could challenge the US for world dominance, so they spent a ton of money to get there. The problem is that instead of soliciting designs, doing rigorous testing to determine the best ships, and then contracting with a company to make a fleet of them, they basically went around to every ship builder in the country and told them to build warships for the navy. Now they've got a huge fleet of ships all built to different design specifications that are not compatible for repairs and refitment, many of which are built to incredibly low standards.

Their huge military isn't just inexperienced, it's also extremely politicized. There may be only one political party in China, but inside said party there are major factions who wield tremendous power and influence. Those factions are aligned with some parts of the military and antagonistic to others. It would be like if the US military was a wing of the Republican party, and 1/3rd of them was loyal to Trump, 1/3rd to Ron DeSantis, and 1/3 to Gregg Abbot.

And remember what I said at the top. I'm definitely not claiming that the Chinese military is as weak as the Russian military. What I'm saying is that the image people have of Chinese military power is an illusion disguising a fundamentally flawed institution that has nowhere near the ability to project power than they'd love the world to believe.",False,1665003867.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir71ah4,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

The Final Cut was basically a Waters album. I think the other members didn't like it that much.

Gilmour/Mason/Wright were opposite of Waters, but those 4 combined were the best together. As long as they got to temper down the influence of Waters. Comfortably Numb was the highlight on The Wall and that was because of Gilmour.

Yeah, Waters was a shite bass player. Gilmour could play bass better and even did so often, but Waters got the credit on those songs.

It says that including loses in Lyman (9 dead and 1-2 heavily wounded) they accounted for 46 dead soldiers of that brigade total. Considering the number of wounded to dead is on average 3.5:1 they assess around 200 people left the brigade at least temporarily. 

3rd brigade looking at it's structure can have between 1200 and 1600 soldiers. BBC is approximating that recon companies make about 300 people - hence that title. They are saying that 3rd brigade could lose up to 75% of it's recon force. 

That's why I was surprised by that number - I don't have any love to Russians, but I remember one of the special forces meeting. 3rd was considered one of the best trained, including psychological training, unit for covert ops. They have signal specialists (think hackers), they have force recon, they have teams that are prepared to stay behind enemy lines for years. 
They also can support line units if there is a need - and there was in Lyman. Probably they were the ones that organized the first evac column when Lyman did receive the order to slow down UA as much as possible and then they lost contact with HQ.

Id be happy to see your data on the percentages of the German population who actively worked on removing Hitler, who protested and handed out leaflets. The history books I've read on the subject at least paint the German population largely apathetic to the plight of the Poles, the Jews, or the Russians. 

While you're at it, get data on the percentage of the Russian population for the same criteria. I suspect you'll have some trouble though and that's my point here really: everyone is hyped up to deem Russians the most evil people who ever walked on the earth, who don't deserve any redemption. I get that people are emotional and angry but I think anyone reasonably educated in history is not ready to categorically judge Russians as worse than Germans during WW2. 

Russians are not a cartoonist bogeyman who jacks off to genocide of the Ukrainians. That's a minority of ethnofascists. The majority absolutely wouldn't wish any harm on Ukrainians and would happily return to 1991 borders. The majority couldn't give a shit if the whole world joined NATO, if it means they could keep their job and cary on their normal life. Like Germans, a large number of them don't even know half the shit that is happening in Ukraine. Unless you're inside opposition telegram channels or have vpns to access outside media, what do you expect them to believe?

Germany was able to prosper following the war because the Allies occupied it entirely and rebuilt the country from the ground up. The Allies overthrew Hitler. The German people had nothing to do with it. If the west was able to do the same in Russia, there's no reason to think the same result couldn't be achieved. The problem there is nukes, now.

It's not that Putin doesn't understand how Russian doctrine works. It's that he doesn't understand social media.

Russian (well, Soviet in lineage) doctrine always leaned towards sloggy, meat-grinder type attacks. Indeed, other nations that build their doctrine in the Soviet style do much the same, they rely on their media and control of the public enabling them to take losses that the other side simply cannot stomach, and to commit total scorched earth war without it feeding back, negatively, to their own people. This worked pretty well in WW2. It worked well for North Korea in the 50s fighting South Korea and the US. It worked for North Vietnam. It worked for Russia and specifically Putin in Chechnya. He knows how to fight this way and win.

What Putin doesn't do is tech. Reportedly he does not use the Internet himself, or even have a computer, outside of the one we see him making video calls on, which he does not directly operate. He seems to understand how to control a nation's broadcast media, but not the irrelevance of that in the modern world where social media permeates everything and is faster, more detailed, and way more granular - you can just block an opposition voiced paper or radio station, it's much harder to stop a thousand small sites posting a little bit of content, and even then, things like VPNs and TOR exist, and I do not believe that Putin really understands what those are capable of - despite clearly having an in-depth knowledge and interest in older spycraft.

That, for me, is one of the things that has become his undoing - his own soldiers are not cut off from each other and only able to communicate via their formal command structures. Russian doctrine demands a total top-down approach when it comes to instruction, and that also means centralisation of the flow of information. In WW2, if a Soviet unit got absolutely mauled in a battle, they had no reliable way to know if that incident was isolated or systemic. Neither would the families back home have the ability to determine whether their sons were in the unlucky minority if they did not return, or whether this was a widespread issue with heavy losses. Social media completely undermines that encapsulation that Russian doctrine is founded upon.

Putin seems to have looked at his own handling of Chechnya as the model for his invasion of Ukraine: heavy bombing, city levelling, war crimes, and overall short, sharp, brutal assaults, relying heavily on a subset of the opposition being turncoats, and enough to swing the undecided in favour of the easiest way to end the violence - capitulation. What he did not anticipate was the Ukrainian resolve, their ability to spread information, and his own troops ability to learn of other failures.

The war that Putin *should* have looked to as a model was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which was set against the Glasnost era of Soviet politics and arguably was the war's undoing. If Stalin's regime had conducted that invasion, losses would have been higher but it may well have ended in ""victory"" for the USSR, even if pyrrhic, as the true costs would have been concealed from the public as a collective whole. Instead, people within Russia were aware of the failures of the Soviet Red Army and began to protest and create unrest, which tipped the balance on an already fragile regime.",False,1664976314.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir579iw,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

In 2014, Ukraine’s military was suffering from decades of corrupt, Russian-style management and had almost no modern equipment. The country was heavily divided after the ousting of Ukraine’s Russian-backed president, Yanukovich. Unsurprisingly, the areas Russia carved off easily in 2014 were the ones that were most vocally in favor of Yanukovich. Facing a divided country with aging equipment and no clear leadership, Russia won with little bloodshed. 

2022 Ukraine is a different beast. Humiliated by the loss of Crimea and a significant part of the Donbas, Ukraine reformed their military structure, bought a lot of modern equipment, and started training their soldiers according to NATO standards. Ukraine’s soldiers started getting fighting experience staring down separatists in the Donbas. The country had started tackling all of the corruption from decades of direct and indirect Russian rule.

5f39b0e4ab16d52347f4662dee29165d,xw02mj,ir5f5px,"Okay, more explanation:

First of all, remember that a lot of European cities are really, really old, to the point that their names have evolved with various languages and have proper *translations*. For example, the Roman city of Flōrentia became Florence in French (and English) and Firenze in Italian, and even the Italian government will switch between the names depending on which language they're speaking. But those are also fairly recognizable as distinct *names*, as opposed to Firenze just being the Italian ""spelling""

The Ukrainian capital is *also* one of those really old cities, although since it's slightly younger and more regionally significant, it mostly only has different names in the various East Slavic languages, plus a few Baltic and West Slavic languages. (I'm going to pick on Polish, because for whatever reason, they most consistently have their own names for cities) In this case, those cognate names include Київ (Ukrainian), Киев (Russian), and Kijów (Polish). Notably, the names all generally agree on K-J-V for consonants, with J here being IPA /j/ or an English Y, and the sound changes have mostly just produced different vowels. (And, no, it's not a coincidence that the only difference in the written forms is the second vowel. Sound changes happened, and the letter и is basically Ukrainian's version of how English I is ""eye"" not ""ee"")

However, there's a bit of a problem. The Ukrainian and Russian *languages* use the Cyrillic script, so we can't really just borrow it directly and we need to transliterate it. There are a few different ways you can reasonably transliterate the names, but it mostly comes down to how to handle that middle consonant. Kyjiv and Kijev make it distinct with a <j>, Kyyiv and Kiyev make it more obvious to English speakers with a <y>, and Kyiv and Kiev just drop it, but regardless of which one you pick, the vowels are still Y and I in Ukrainian or I and E in Russian. (Noting that the I in Kyiv actually shifts to an E when you add endings, like genitive Kyj**e**va)

Historically, languages that don't have a local name for the city, like English, have borrowed the Russian name, since it's historically the dominant culture in the region. But since independence, the Ukrainian government has asked that if we're going to borrow a name for the city from a local language, to please use the Ukrainian language name, not the Russian language one. That is, Kyiv (or variants like Kyjiv), not Kiev (or variants like Kijev). Although, and I want to emphasize this, because I think it helps explain what's actually going on, the Ukrainian *government*, even, will call the city Киев when writing in Russian, because that's just its name in Russian. The ""name change"" is about languages that don't have a native name for the city and need to borrow one. This is also important because it's two separate names and us switching which one we're borrowing, not spelling differences, as if Ukrainian is just a Russian dialect like Russia claims. *Spelling* differences would be something like Zelenskyy being the official Romanization of Зеленський, while something like ISO would transliterate it Zelens'kyj.

And finally, pronunciation. No, it's not pronounced KEEV /kiv/; that's wholly an invention of the English-speaking news media assuming that there must be some substantially different pronunciation to go along with the new ""spelling"". Remember, it's basically the exact same name, just with different vowels because of sound changes in the two languages. For the most part, they're both just K-J/Y-V, with different vowels inserted. In the case of Ukrainian, it's Y (b**i**t, IPA /ɪ/) and I (EE, IPA /i/) for something like KIH-yeev. Although /v/ in Ukrainian actually has [w] as an allophone in a few cases, including at the end of a word, so it's actually more like [ˈkɪjiw]. That diphthong at the end isn't *really* present in English (it's roughly ""ew""), and it isn't helped by the fact that /ji/ is a really rare combination of sounds (it's the archaic 2nd person plural subject pronoun ""ye""), but overall, I'd consider /ju/ like the word ""you"" a decent approximation, making the city's name in Ukrainian sound sort of like KIH-you.

The truth is that Ukraine wanted to attack Kherson and went to NATO with their plan for the attack.  NATO wargamed it out and told Ukraine it was a bad idea.  Ukraine almost went through with it anyway, against NATO's advice, but others in Ukraine's military leadership talked them down.  Ukraine then brought up Kharkiv.  NATO wargamed it out, and came back with the assessment that it would work (With a few revisions in the plan from NATO).  Ukraine launched the revised attack plan.

NATO is absolutely playing a part, a huge part, and their intel and military knowledge has been invaluable to Ukraine, which I think is your major point, but the final say on all military matters rests with Ukraine, and it was Ukraine that brought up Kharkiv, as an alternative to Kherson, not NATO insisting where and when to attack.",1665010857.0,1665010481.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir7hdll,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

But also because it's been the same with every Russian leader before him for thousands of years, and the only likely successors are siloviks who will just be more of the same.

Completely routing this out would involve taking power from all those who currently wield it in Russia, stamping out corruption and changing the entire society's value system—a process that will take generations at least.

Don't expect that Putin leaving office will result in some marked and significant change (although, given how weak Russia is then likely to be, we may well get 10–15 years of relative peace while they lick their wounds and rebuild their strength; during which it's quite possible that some parts of the Federation may break away).",False,1664950365.0,t3_xw02mj,t1_ir4a7n8,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

It's kind of similar to what the Russians are experiencing now, actually. The Nazi's just weren't ready for the vastness of the Soviet Union and since the Soviets wouldn't surrender, a victory was never going to happen. A stalemate, perhaps, but the attrition for the nazi's was huge.

 >The war on terror, officially the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), is an ongoing international counter-terrorism military campaign initiated by the United States following the September 11 attacks. The targets of the campaign are primarily Islamic terrorist groups, with prominent targets including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The ""war on terror"" uses war as a metaphor to describe a variety of actions which fall outside the traditional definition of war taken to eliminate international terrorism.

Reporting and opinion are totally different things. 

> The US would not admonish one of their partners as they imply

Why not? The US doesn't want to get dragged into this any further than they need to be. Otherwise the Ukrainians would've gotten the long range arty they've been asking for and they would be blowing up civilian infrastructure in Russia the way Russia's doing to them.

FWIW I think the assassination of Dugina/attempted assassination of Dugin was in an ethical gray zone....there are good arguments for and against. We don't want to see car bombs become regular occurrences, and there are any number of international agreements that assassinations of civilians violate; the US has been right at the forefront of the development of post-1945 international law. But at the same time it's hard to say she or her father didn't have it coming. Live by the sword, die by the sword and all that.

The US definitely doesn't want to see this become the norm, so putting this out there publicly (as opposed to keeping this confined to diplomatic backchannels) accomplishes two things. One, you get the denial of involvement of the US, which is important for the larger Western political goal of non-escalation. Two, it's to remind the Ukrainians that they do not have carte blanche to do whatever they want. You can call it parochial or whatever, but without the smaller scale Western assistance that began post-2014, Ukraine would be in real trouble at the moment. (To say nothing of the much more overt assistance that began in 2022.)

Finally, consider the wording here:

> United States intelligence agencies believe **parts** of the Ukrainian government authorized the car bomb attack

That's pretty specific. It doesn't say ""United States intelligence agencies believe *Ukraine* authorized etc,"" it says ""*parts* of the Ukrainian gov't."" And then they go on to talk to an ""adviser"" to Zelensky, who says Ukraine has better targets than Dugina (although it doesn't seem like he's averse to using car bombs in particular).

And then he did it as soon as he felt his hand was forced by Ukranian advances. How much do you think he would feel forced to respond if NATO wipe out his army?

>Putin of course. NATO loses nothing by fucking up their military in Ukraine, and the black sea. They gain a destroyed Russian military. Who do you think stands to lose more?

I think you're misunderstanding here. My comment has baked into it that Putin uses a tactical nuke and NATO respond by wiping out his army with conventional weapons. In this scenario, Putin stands less to lose in a strategic exchange than NATO does. In this scenario, he might just think his fancy new missiles could give him sufficient first strike capability and make a nuclear war preferable than national humiliation, being ousted from power and probable imprisonment.

>Your point was his own people will oust him. They won't. They sucked up sanctions. They sucked up censorship. They left the country instead when it really got to a point where it might impact them personally. They'll do nothing.

What on earth do you think NATO entering Ukraine achieves from a strategic perspective? Seriously confused here. The Russian army is basically destroyed already.

Taking out a few ships would probably have the inverse effect and galvanise Russian civilians and soldiers in a flag rally. That have been fed years of lies that NATO is out to get them. Putin's lies would be proven correct to them.

On top of that the risk of a world ending strategic nuclear exchange increases to near 100%. And for what? You think NATO attacking Russia will make Putin \*less likely\* to use another Nuke, or more likely? Think about it.

The only way out of this that doesn't involve megadeaths on a global scale is to do everything in our power to make sure NATO stays the defensive alliance it is and not the aggressive imperial alliance Putin and China have been claiming it is. The longer the war goes on the worse it is for Putin domestically. Him using a nuke would accelerate that process massively both economically and in terms of internal dissent - fear is the strongest motivator and the whole world, including Russian citizens, would shit themselves. Our only hope out of this is that Putin is somehow toppled internally.

Directly destroying what little is left of his army won't bring bim to the negotiating table and I can 100% assure of that. In fact I'm 90% sure it would directly lead to the deaths of millions of people.

100% agreed. However, if Putin somehow is removed from power, the next person or group of people will have less power. Less legitimacy. Putin still ""saved Russia from the 90's"". The next person in line will have little going for them.

So the most optimistic take is that Putin falls, and that in the ensuing chaos other people manage to organize.

When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, the Soviet military was not up to the task of defending the country. Soviet troops bought time with land and blood. By the end of 1942 the Soviets finally stopped the German military outside Moscow and in Stalingrad, but it was close. 

By then the Soviets had already received 2.5 million tons of material and resources from the US alone (I couldn't quickly find the UK numbers) and it only increased from there. 2.5 million tons of material is such a huge number that it's hard to fathom, but remove it from the Soviet army, and there woulld be just a skeletal force left.

Without those amounts, which represents enough to equip millions of men, would the Soviet armies collapsed before they could evacuate their industry? Would they have been stuck on the wrong side of the Ural mountains, starving in Siberia? We can't know for sure, but it seems quite likely.

Stalin claimed in 1943 that without lend-lease they would have already lost the war. (He didn't say that to his own population mind you)

When the war ended, the US alone had sent material worth $180 billion in today's money, including 15 million boots, half a million vehicles and 14,000 airplanes. I suspect more or less every Soviet solder was dressed in American clothes.

Of course we cannot know for sure what would have happened without the lend-lease programs, but it's very hard to believe the Soviet state could have survived without them.

The Israeli agents had mistaken their target for Ali Hassan Salameh, the chief of operations for Black September. Six of the Mossad team of fifteen were captured and convicted of complicity in the killing by the Norwegian justice system in a major blow to the intelligence agency's reputation.

Because that is not the way these kinds of contacts between lower level officials work. There is no need for public posturing and the announcement of policies like you would have for a politician than might publically ""admonish"" another government for it's actions. An army officer or CIA station chief has no need to demean or score points on the Ukranian army officer or intelligence agent sitting accross the table. The same for diplomats.

Some are activated by magnetic fields of a vehicle, but some are pressure activated, and it might be to do with the larger size of the mine than a person's foot meaning the pressure distribution is different. 

A quick search might support this: 

> Modern antitank mines work on a full width principle instead of pressure activated. There are 2 main ways that they are triggered.

> The first is by a tilt rod mechanism. When a tank rolls over the mine it causes the tilt rod to bend detonating the mine. A human has enough weight to also trigger this.  

>The second type is off route. The mine either picks up that it is being shaken and detonates after a count down or it detects the tank with a laser. Either way it detonates and sends an explosive or an explosive formed slug at the armored vehicle. Some of these may be susceptible to a person breaking the laser beam, but I doubt it.

Apparently some anti-tank mines can be set off by people, by design. If you have enough mines that's not an issue, it's potentially still a dead enemy.

Err, that would be NATO entering the war militarily. I think you are taking the word ""entering"" very literally here. Entering Ukrainian and de-facto Russian airspace with the intention of killing Russian soldiers is directly attacking Russia. It is genuinely amazing that you don't understand this.

Ukraine is already clearing up and that is with quite limited military support from NATO compared in what could be provided in terms of long range missiles, tanks and aircraft. We've given them ostensibly defensive munitions so far. We can escalate our support without entering directly. There are also stages of sanctions we have not gone to yet which could obliterate Russian liquidity.

>I also didn't say anything about attacking Russia. You're not reading what I actually said.

See above.

Putin would feel justified in a strategic nuclear strike against NATO if NATO attacked Russian forces in Ukraine and that is pretty clearly spelt out in their Nuclear doctrine. If he think Ukraine taking their 5 annexed regions back is an ""existential threat"", then I don't understand how you think the largest military in the world wiping out what is rest of their army in a neutral warzone (as far as NATO doctrine is concerned) would not constitute an ""existential threat to the Russian state"" which would then justify a strategic nuclear launch.
