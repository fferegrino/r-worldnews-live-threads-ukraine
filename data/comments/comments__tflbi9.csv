>It’s Day 21 of the invasion, and there are a few significant updates:

https://twitter.com/DanLamothe/status/1504189743348830209

Washington Post

>- First, the Pentagon assesses today that Russian warships are now shelling areas around Odessa, a major port city in southwestern Ukraine. 

>- Other naval activity also has increased, with Russian landing craft moving around but not going ashore, the senior defense official said.

>- It’s still unclear if Russia will attempt an amphibious landing on or near Odessa. Russia launched one amphibious landing farther east early in the landing, but it was small and on an uncontested shoreline, the senior defense official said.

>- For the first time, the Pentagon assesses Wednesday that Russia is discussing sending “replacement troops” to backfill for combat losses. It sees no indications yet that any have moved yet, the senior defense official said. Open-source reports suggest that some already may have.

>- On weapons deliveries: The Pentagon declines to say what drones it is delivering but calls them “tactical” in nature.On weapons deliveries: The Pentagon declines to say what drones it is delivering but calls them “tactical” in nature.

>- Knowing that many tactical drones are single-use and kamikaze in nature, I asked if it’s possible more could be delivered in rolling fashion, like Javelin missiles are.   “I wouldn’t rule it out,” the senior defense official said.

>- Advance north of Kyiv is still stalled. Cities that were isolated still are. Ukraine is still in control of Brovary, a town to Kyiv’s east where fierce fighting has occurred, senior defense official says.

>- More than 980 Russian missiles have been launched since the war begin, the senior defense official says. That number continues to climb by several dozen per day.

>- It’s “safe to assume” that @SecDef will be asking Slovakian and Bulgarian officials this week what Soviet/Russian systems they may be willing to provide to Ukraine, the senior defense official says. 

>- Some countries may have concerns about giving their own systems away, he adds.

>- “I know that everyone is focused on the S-300, but there are lots of different air-defense systems” that could be provided to Ukraine, senior defense official says, declining to name them.

>- No appreciable change in how much Ukraine and Russia are flying in the war, senior defense official says.  To date, Ukraine is flying a handful of sorties per day and Russia has been flying about 200, though some do not cross into Ukrainian airspace.

>- Finally: Two reporters raised the lack of media access to U.S. military units deployed in eastern Europe in response to Russia's buildup and invasion of Ukraine.  Senior defense official says ""I appreciate the question,"" but that he has no change in media posture to share.

>- Footnote there: A couple of journalists did briefly visit U.S. troops in eastern Europe countries recently while traveling with Gen. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

We are only sending 100 which doesn't sound like a lot but these are precision munitions, used to strike high value targets. Might see a few more generals get popped.          
As an armchair general, I think these will be incredibly useful for small teams(probably special forces) to get close enough(10-15km) to anti-air missile systems like the Pantsir-S1 and take them out. This opens holes in the air defense that allows the Bayraktars(and fighter jets) to get close enough to fire missiles at Russian assets.      
This was pretty much the strategy in the Azerbaijan/Armenia conflict(2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war). The similar small suicide/loitering munitions drones would often be tasked to take out the Pantsirs allowing the bigger Bayraktars to get close enough to devastate the rest of the Russian equipped Armenian forces with missiles.

> **Bulgaria** – ten S-300 launchers, divided into two units with five launchers each.[99]

> **Greece**[109] – S-300 PMU1 system acquired after the Cyprus Missile Crisis and operated by HAF on Crete consisting of 1 regiment/4 systems/8 fire units/32 launchers / 175 missiles.[110] Greece first fired an S-300 during the White Eagle 2013 military exercise, which was the first time it was used since it had been bought 14 years earlier.[citation needed]
> 
>  **Slovakia** – One battery S-300PMU and 48 missiles type 5V55R inherited from Czechoslovakia. 3 missiles were fired during exercise in Bulgaria in 2015.[125]
> 
> **Ukraine** – S-300PT, S-300PS, S-300V.[138] Only six systems were kept in working conditions between 2004 and 2014; as a result only 40% of Ukrainian S-300 systems were in good condition prior to 2014.[139] Due to the war with Russia Ukraine started repairing and pushing back to service several armaments included several S-300 batteries,[140] with at least 4 batteries overhauled in the period 2014–15. 34 launchers remained in the Crimea after 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea.[141]

You deleted your shithead level comment but here’s my reply to you 

I have friends I helped evacuate in Ukraine who lived where some of the heaviest fighting is taking place. I have another who’s now without a leg that I’m again trying to help evacuate from a city under siege. I volunteered in a live conflict zone previously. Every cent I make that I’m not spending on my bare necessities has been going to donations and a smaller portion since 2014. I don’t even have Facebook dumbass. So shut up and go do something instead of assuming shit. I didn’t say weapons don’t win wars, I was pointing out the shithead thing it is to publicly muse over how one could have profited over a war and humanitarian crisis cunt.

For anyone wondering what he actually said,
He asked me if I was a soy boy and if my wife pegged me and to go change my Facebook profile picture because I seemed like an 18 year old hippie  over being somewhat appalled at musing over not investing in defense to profit off the war.",1647459302.0,1647458860.0,t3_tflbi9,t3_tflbi9,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

> 
> MARCH 16, 2022, 11:02 AM
> 
> Top U.S. and United Nations officials believe there are credible reports of Russian forces using deadly cluster munitions banned by most of the world in the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine, a sign of the Kremlin’s increasing disregard for civilian life and humanitarian law in the three-week-old war.
> 
> “The cluster munitions use has been flagrant and widespread and not geographically isolated,” said one independent weapons inspector with knowledge of the conflict, who spoke to Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity. “It’s been broadly used in Kharkiv and in the south and on the coast. It’s not limited to one theater of operations.”
> 
> “They are made to cause maximum casualties and are being used against civilians,” Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told Foreign Policy. “So the projectile fires and it goes into the general vicinity and then explodes, sending small fragmentary grenade type devices everywhere: under things and through windows.”
> 
> But the siege tactics come amid Kremlin frustration over increasingly stiff Ukrainian resistance. The senior U.S. defense official said in their statement that Russia is using a “siege mentality” in attacks, including striking civilian targets in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv with increasing frequency as Ukrainian troops have used hit-and-run attacks to frustrate Russian invaders.

But what depresses me even more, is China's response and their comments about the war. I am under no illusions that China is a friend of human rights, but I had held out hope that they would exert their influence with Russia to stop this madness. Putin is killing civilians, taking control of nuclear power plants, threatening to use nukes, all based on a bizarre Russian Empire irredentist worldview that does not fit with the 21st Century. 

The Chinese government's response to all this is to call for ""all sides"" to de-escalate and pursue dialog. I'm sorry--**what**? Do you think this is two schoolchildren having a quarrel that need to settle down? That is such an out of touch recommendation about the reality. Would China have liked to be told to calm down and de-escalate during the [Rape of Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre), for which they still have not forgiven Japan to this day? And furthermore, their statement that the best next step is for the United States to ""reflect"" on its role in this crisis, is stunning. 

Do you think the Ukrainian civilians being killed give a fuck about the United States reflecting on its role? Even if we grant that NATO expansionism caused this, which by the way I don't grant, how will the United States reflecting on its role fix fuck-all *anything* about this?

It's basically a combined arms unit that's created from a brigade, so a single unit (with about 500/600 soldiers) can field artillery, tanks, infantry, etc. They're entirely made up of volunteers since conscripts can't serve outside of Russia (until Putin changes that law).

But the important thing is that as of Feb. 24 already more than 3/4 of them were surrounding Ukraine. So when the US says 75% of them are active, it's basically the full use of the dedicated invasion forces.

We love to use WW2 all the time for references, as a historian this annoys me frustratingly much. Because this is not WW2.

In WW2 the Munich conference was basically the UK and France agreeing to give up parts of Czechoslovakia which was not even present or recognized at the conference to surrender territory to Germany in exchange for ""promises of peace"" and Hitler's words that he did not want more. There were no sanctions, or military support to the CZ. Then when he remilitarized the Rheinland, nothing was done again.

The war in Ukraine is entirely different. Yes it is similarly a war of aggression but if you want a closer example, it would be the proxy wars of the Cold War, not Hitler's pre war expansionism. What kept the powerbalance in check was nuclear weaponry, both sides knew direct war would mean the end of the war. And back then the Soviet Union was basically independent from the Global Economy and there were no easy ways for the west to economically destroy the country.

Today with modern Russia being part of the globalized world its a lot easier to wreck havoc without going to direct war risking nukes. Armament, weaponry, intelligence and sanctions are all part of a defensive strategy that is not ""giving Putin what he wants"". If anything he has been ruined, his legitimacy shaken, their economy is in shambles. Whilst the Ukrainians are putting up a heavier fight than thought possible thanks to western equipment etc.

Appeasement would be the world doing nothing, letting Putin agree believing his words of peace. This is not appeasement.

Edit: because of smartassery. 
Appeasement would be the world just giving Ukraine up, buying Russias word for peace and not send support to avoid reprecussions etc. But with basic literally this would have been already apparent in my text.

Addendum: Appeasement would be to ignore Zelensky and the Ukrainians pleas for aid, to just let the war happen. Whilst NATO can't feasibly provide everything they ask for they are doing a lot.

Addendum 2: Yes I know the people of Kyiv, Mariupol, Odessa, Kharkiv and all of Ukraine is suffering. I see commenters use this to argue with my rhetoric. But unlike most and yes you can call me out for it, I don't want a nuclear war, my nation is a non NATO member but already at risk of going to war. But I would still say the same thing if my nation eventually gets invaded, rather have support from NATO than risk nuclear war that kills us all. Yes go along with the copium that ""nukes won't be launched"" maybe they wouldn't but the risk genuinely remains.

Best course of action:

1.  Preemptively use all remaining sanctions
2.  Offer to lift these sanctions when Russia withdraws
3.  Threaten military intervention for nuclear or chemical attack
4.  Threaten to engage and degrade ground forces in Ukraine with air strikes if they remain in Ukraine beyond a fixed deadline

Right now, Putin thinks nuclear or chemical attack will be met with sanctions on oil & gas.  More sanctions on an already ruined economy is a risk he might be willing to take.  To prevent this, we have to increase the risk of making things worse while providing a benefit to ending the war.

Since Russia can't win at this point with conventional force, yet is continuing the war, the west might as well assume that Russia _will_ use chemical or nuclear weapons if Russia doesn't end the war soon.  Russia has committed an egregious error as a nuclear power by driving themselves into this corner.

By escalating all non-intervention options to the maximum, Putin would know that our next option is to begin shooting Russians, a situation that vastly increase his personal risk.  By offering to roll back aggressive short-term sanctions that the west didn't want to use to anyway (like oil & gas in Germany), there's a credible and clear off-ramp.

The global order is at risk if the free world has to let nuclear powers aggressively enter into doomed conflicts that would require them to use nuclear weapons to win.  We would be right to protect an intervention of such a conflict with the use of nuclear deterrent.  Every day that Russia persists and believes the west will not intervene is bringing us closer and closer to reports of nerve gas or tactical nukes delivered by Iskanders into Kyiv.  And then what will we do?  If it goes that far and all we can do are sanctions, it's a horrible upset to the global framework.",False,1647455169.0,t3_tflbi9,t3_tflbi9,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-proposes-solution-end-ukraine-war-putin-zelensky-1688554):

> A demilitarized Ukraine with its own army could be the solution to end the raging war in Ukraine, Russia said on Wednesday.

> Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted by RIA news agency and Reuters as saying that ""this is a variant that is currently being discussed and which could really be seen as a compromise.""

> It's not yet clear if the offer of neutrality has come from Ukrainian officials, but Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky has claimed so. On Wednesday, he told state TV that ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarized state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.""	

> The suggested solution was confirmed by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who speaking to RBC news on Wednesday said ""neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees.""

> He added that ""negotiations are not easy for obvious reasons,"" while he hoped a compromise could be reached. He said the sides were close to agreeing on the terms of this solution.

> Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine could agree only to ""legally certified security guarantees,"" and Ukraine is discussing a new agreement under which the country would be protected by a group of allies legally bound to defend Ukraine in case of attacks.

> A demilitarized Ukraine would not be able to host any foreign military base, join any international military alliance, or participate in a war.

> That a solution to the conflict might be reached at the Ukraine-Russia negotiating table seems in line with recent statements from both parties, who have proclaimed that progress towards ending the war has been made after weeks of death, loss and resistance.

> On Tuesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his country will give up on its aim to join the NATO alliance. This key concession was likely seen as a positive start for peace talks from Russian officials.

> ""Ukraine is not a member of NATO. We understand that. We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognized,"" Zelensky said in a video message.

> Russia made Ukraine not joining NATO a key reason for its troops massing at the Ukrainian border before launching a full invasion. NATO never agreed to give such assurance, sticking to its open doors policy.

> On Wednesday, Zelensky said negotiations sounded ""more realistic"" and that though the parties might be closer to a compromised, ""time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine.""

> ** The Precedents of Austria and Sweden**

> Austria, which has been mentioned as an example of a demilitarized country, has been neutral since 1955. After World War II, the country was under the occupation of both U.S. and the Soviet Union, and it was only allowed independence once it promised permanent neutral status.

> Because of its neutrality, Austria isn't a member of NATO, but it is a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) and NATO's Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC).

> The alpine, landlocked country has also participated in U.N. peacekeeping operations around the world, including in Kosovo, Lebanon and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

> Sweden's neutrality dates back to the 19th century, and it was maintained even after the principle was formally abolished in 1995 when the country joined the European Union.

> 
> March 16, 2022
> 10:34 AM EDT
> 
> Russia’s sudden disappearance from global trade leaves a big economic hole. After being isolated for most of the Cold War, the country became a major commodities exporter. That’s why the loss of an economy smaller than the U.S. state of Texas is pushing up global prices for energy, metals and wheat.
> 
> Russia’s sudden pariah status has therefore sparked a global scramble for alternate supplies for everything from gas to nickel to fertilizer. For example, Russia is the second-biggest seller of sunflower seed oil. Heightened demand for alternatives has prompted Indonesia to restrict exports of palm oil, which is used in everything from margarine to chocolate.
> 
> CONTEXT NEWS
> 
> - Russia said on March 10 that it would ban the exports of certain goods until the end of 2022. The sectors involved include telecommunications, agriculture, technology, automotive, medical and forestry. The Economy Ministry said it’s a logical response to international sanctions imposed on Russia.

Ukraine has slowed down Russia more than anyone could have imagined, but they have plenty of sheep and wagons (Men and Equipment) to send to the slaughter. They can and will keep piling on. Some here will argue that time is of the essence for Russia, but I disagree. Russia is trying to beat them by attrition. And given Russia's numbers and equipment it is their best bet now that blitzkrieg has failed.

The court decided to confiscate everything the offender tried to smuggle -** €68,835, $140,230**, 12,100 Polish zlotys, as well as 327 items of gold jewelry (including inlays), gold pellets, gold bars, coins and scrap gold.

China had hoped that Russia's foray into Ukraine here wouldn't fundamentally upset the strategic balance in Europe - that it would bolster Russia's strategic position vs Europe, rather than rapidly degrade it.

 >The AeroVironment Switchblade is a miniature-sized loitering munition drone developed by AeroVironment. It is designed as a ""kamikaze drone"", being able to crash into its target with an explosive warhead to destroy it. The Switchblade is small enough to be carried in a backpack and can be launched from a variety of ground, maritime, and air platforms. Two variants exist, the Switchblade 300 and the Switchblade 600.

Guided munitions can steer their way towards a target so they can be dropped at different altitudes and speeds (I.e. much higher up out of range of air defenses) and still hit their targets because you can steer them in.  These are better but much more expensive obviously.

The weird thing is that Russia is using dumb bombs at all because it puts the plane at much higher risk of being shot down.  Dumb bombs aren't as much use on legitimate military targets because those will have defenses around them that can shoot down the plane.

In a vast military like Russia's there will be several tiers of military readiness.

I am not an expert on Russia's army, but for the sake of simplicity, we can break it into three broad categories:

1) **Battle ready, fully mobilized standing units** - these are the forces that a country has ready to go right freaking now if s*** hits the fan. They are fully equipped, supplied, have completed training, passed inspection and are otherwise ready to get into a fight at a drop of a hat. 75% of these units have been deployed, according to the source.

2) **Not Mobilized Regular Units** - These are units that are part of the full-time standing military (being a soldier is the full time job of its members) but they are not ready to join a fight at the drop of a hat for one reason or another. They might be in training, might not be fully equipped for combat because of required repairs or restocking, might not be fully supplied (lacking ammunition, key equipment, rations or transport) or they might not have passed battle readiness inspection. Often its as simple a thing as marshalling enough ammunition and supplies and moving them all to the front - but simple does not always mean easy. However, these units can be made battle ready in time. Russia has a lot of units that it can draw upon in this category. An appreciable minority of Russia's standing military units have been deployed, but they have an awful lot more to draw upon. 

3) **Not Mobilized Reserve Units** - These units are mostly composed of part-time soldiers who have other jobs. Before being deployed, they need to be called up, assembled, their equipment inspected and prepped, supplies marshalled and probably need some refresher training. Calling them up is a major logistical and economic problem, as it pulls them from their current jobs and getting them ready to go is no small thing. A lot of their equipment is in mothball storage or of an older make. They won't usually have the potent mix of advanced and expensive equipment that regular units are furnished with. They can be made ready in a matter of days, weeks, or months depending on the situation. Russia has millions of people enlisted in reserve units. They have not even begun to scratch the surface of this pool, but calling them up carries economic and political risks.",False,1647462824.0,t3_tflbi9,t1_i0xb97t,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

After all Russia would have nothing to gain by committing war crimes, clearly the Kremlin is smarter than that.

1. Their goal is to force the Mariupol to surrender.
2. They are attempting to force the city to surrender, by targeting the civilian population and civilian infrastructure.  They've encircled the city, so no supplies are getting in or out.  They've destroyed the infrastructure that delivers water, and the infrastructure that delivers electricity.
3. They are shelling residential areas, with the intention of creating as many civilian casualties as possible.  And they are destroying the hospitals, so that wounded civilians (and soldiers, and POWs) have much worse treatment options.
4. The Russian strategy, as awful as it is, is to create such horrible, unlivable conditions for the population of the encircled city, so that local leaders feel as though they have no choice but to surrender the city to the Russians.

I don't know how effective this is.  A large 'unknown' is ""did Mariupol stockpile emergency resources within the city for this exact scenario, and did they retain control of them, and how much do they really have?""  If they have stockpiles of supplies for this exact purpose (which is feasible; due to Mariupol's location, they knew they would be a target) then they could last a relatively long time under siege.  

If Mariupol has the supplies to hold out for a long time, then Russia's strategy will likely rely on **using artillery** to reduce the city to rubble.  It doesn't seem like Russia has the continued capability (the numbers of infantry needed) to conduct successful offenses against entrenched forces within cities.

1) ""Poland's MiG-29s, though originally built during the Soviet era, have been substantially upgraded over the years and are much more advanced than Ukraine's examples. Beyond that, the cockpit layout of these aircraft is substantially different from the types that the Ukrainian Air Force has in inventory now. (...) Some amount of instruction will be necessary.

2) ""There are also certain NATO-specific or otherwise sensitive systems that will need to be removed from the aircraft first. Any sort of demodification process would take some amount of time.""

They will also need to be repainted so that Russian forces don't confuse (or deliberately mislabel) Ukrainian MiG-29s as Polish/NATO aircraft and thus justify widening the war significantly. 

Translation: This will take time. 

Additionally: 

3) 28 MiG-29s is a good start. It doubles the number of MiG-29's the Ukrainians have in their force but ground wars are very rarely won exclusively by fighter aircraft. Also, the MiG-29 is forty years old (entered service in 1982) and there are many, many much more advanced fighters out there. Additionally, the Russians have ***hundreds*** (plural) of their own MiG-29s and hundreds (plural) more of the more advanced Sukhoi fighters. Maybe it's true that the Ukrainian air force is vastly better trained but in the words of Chairman Mao, ""Quantity has a quality all of its own.""

Finally, wars are not exclusively fought and won by fighter jets. That is just one tool in a much larger toolbox of weapons and systems that can and will need to be employed for one side to emerge victorious.",False,1647451953.0,t3_tflbi9,t1_i0wql9j,,1,21,0,21,1,0,

""Ukraine and Russia have made significant progress on a tentative 15-point peace plan including a ceasefire and Russian withdrawal if Kyiv declares neutrality and accepts limits on its armed forces, according to three people involved in the talks.

The proposed deal, which Ukrainian and Russian negotiators discussed in full for the first time on Monday, would involve Kyiv renouncing its ambitions to join Nato and promising not to host foreign military bases or weaponry in exchange for protection from allies such as the US, UK and Turkey, the people said.

The nature of western guarantees for Ukrainian security — and their acceptability to Moscow — could yet prove to be a big obstacle to any deal, as could the status of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and its proxies in 2014. A 1994 agreement underpinning Ukrainian security failed to prevent Russian aggression against its neighbour.

Although Moscow and Kyiv both said on Wednesday that they had made progress on the terms of a deal, Ukrainian officials remain sceptical Russian President Vladimir Putin is fully committed to peace and worry that Moscow could be buying time to regroup its forces and resume its offensive.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Financial Times that any deal would involve “the troops of the Russian Federation in any case leaving the territory of Ukraine” captured since the invasion began on February 24 — namely southern regions along the Azov and Black Seas, as well as territory to the east and north of Kyiv.

Ukraine would maintain its armed forces but would be obliged to stay outside military alliances such as Nato and refrain from hosting foreign military bases on its territory.

Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that neutrality for Ukraine based on the status of Austria or Sweden was a possibility.

“This option is really being discussed now, and is one that can be considered neutral,” said Peskov.

Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said that “absolutely specific wordings” were “close to being agreed” in the negotiations.

Despite the progress in peace talks, Ukrainian cities came under heavy shelling for a third consecutive night while Kyiv said it was launching a counter-offensive against Russian invaders.

In a virtual address to members of Congress on Wednesday, Zelensky pleaded for the US to enforce a no-fly zone or provide fighter jets or other means to fend off Russia’s attack on his country, and impose harsher economic sanctions on Moscow.

In a dramatic appeal, Zelensky said Ukraine needed America’s support after Russia had launched a “brutal offensive against our values”. He called on Americans to remember the attacks on Pearl Harbor and of September 2001 and showed a searing video of the missile attacks and shelling destroying Ukrainian cities.

Though Ukraine’s constitution commits it to seeking membership of Nato, Zelensky and his aides have increasingly played down Ukraine’s chances of joining the transatlantic military alliance, a prospect that Russia sees as a provocation.

“There is no effective system of European security now, which would be moderated by Nato. As soon as a serious war began in Europe, Nato quickly stepped aside,” Podolyak said.

“We propose a ‘Ukrainian model of security guarantees,’ which implies the immediate and legally verified participation of a number of guarantor countries in the conflict on the side of Ukraine, if someone again encroaches on its territorial integrity,” he added.

Ukraine, Podolyak added, would as part of any deal “definitely retain its own army”. He also played down the significance of a ban on foreign bases in Ukraine, saying that was already precluded by Ukrainian law.

Two of the people said the putative deal also included provisions on enshrining rights for the Russian language in Ukraine, where it is widely spoken though Ukrainian is the only official language. Russia has framed its invasion as an attempt to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine from what it claims is “genocide” by “neo-Nazis”.

Podolyak said “humanitarian issues, including language issues, are discussed only through the prism of Ukraine’s exclusive interests”.

The biggest sticking point remains Russia’s demand that Ukraine recognise its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the independence of two separatist statelets in the eastern Donbas border region.

Ukraine has so far refused but is willing to compartmentalise the issue, Podolyak said.

“Disputed and conflict territories \[are\] in a separate case. So far, we are talking about a guaranteed withdrawal from the territories that have been occupied since the start of the military operation on February 24,” when Russia’s invasion began, he said.""",1647446873.0,1647446596.0,t3_tflbi9,t1_i0wdfsa,,1,8,0,8,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

to quote another comment I made on here:

oddly enough, some people like to be informed of the news without having their own mental health affected, and not everyone can look at explicit war imagery for several reasons, including but not limited to triggering memories of being in similar situations in the past. 

there are several survivors of Kosovo who have said that this war triggers their memories. 

not everyone can deal with explicit imagery or even talk of war. some people have lines for how much they can deal with. 

additionally, too much gorey imagery can desensitize you to human suffering, which has awful effects - for example, Russian state TV is showing explicit imagery of Nazi hangings likely as a way to desensitize Russians to the crimes happening in Ukraine. 

look, I think people should be aware as much as you do, but:

* not everyone can mentally deal with it
* some people have lived through similar situations already and have no wish to live it again in the news

A couple more weeks for Donbas.

The first few days would see NATO gain air *supremacy*. The next few days would see Russia's forces out in the open get annihilated. Russia would retreat to or be left with the separatist regions and the cities it controls. NATO and Ukrainian forces would then be faced with the same problems that Russia currently faces in that they either have to destroy the cities, or engage in urban combat.

Russia would be at a huge disadvantage compared to Ukraine's positions in the cities it holds now, because the population would be against them or at best apathetic, and they don't know the turf and wouldn't have had as much time to dig in. Furthermore, NATO forces are much more effective in urban combat than Russian forces, and NATO tanks/AFVs would have better survivability. But nevertheless, there'd be another week of heavy fighting before the Russians in the cities outside of the separatist regions are defeated/surrender.

Getting back the separatist regions fully takes more time. Here Russia has been digging in for years, and has some popular support (nothing like Ukraine has everywhere else, but enough to avoid constant sabotage and open resistance). This takes a further couple weeks to fully defeat the separatists and Russians.

Crimea is left alone except when Ukrainians/NATO return fire on positions in Crimea firing on them.

A month or two from NATO's intervention would see Ukraine, sans Crimea, fully under Ukrainian control. All eyes turn to Crimea and the Kremlin as apparatchiks start lining up to push Putin out a window.

I would expect they could be into Ukraine in a few hours time, depending on the logistics - since you have to ensure food, fuel, ammo will be able to arrive with the troops, and they've had a few weeks to plan around the ideas. 

Now where that could deploy?  there's just too many options.  Would they get naval support? I'm not sure what's currently in the Mediterranean, or would be allowed to pass into the Black sea. could be days, one would assume that discussions with Turkey have already taken place. 

Air support?  that could be minutes. The jets are already in the air, and would just need orders.  US forces would join within whatever flight time is from the base or carrier.   We've seen this in Iraq. anything they can target will get wiped.  And this time they'll have friendly radar to assist. 

Now If putin saw that.. JUST the air power. I'm going to bet he instructs his people to fire off a nuke.   Now the gamble is does it happen?  Do they try, and get a malfunction due to an aged missile?  Or does the person instructed reject the order. 

lets take nukes off the board.  Does anyone notify the russian troops?  do they stay or retreat?  they arent even holding out against NON-military people.   They're starving and cold. How many would just surrender and try to find a way to never return to russia?

Many of their newest most intimidating weapons systems (like T-14 'Armata' Main Battle Tank and the Su-57 Fighter) have been conspicuously absent.

A lot of it actually **was** modern.  Very.  It's not even bad equipment.  It's 80s tech brought up to standard similar to most second-tier western armies; a good analogy would be like Italy or France in terms of technology.

The problem is threefold.  One, there's a lot of corruption in the Russian Army.  It's multilevel corruption, and more cultural; this goes back to soviet times, but, cultural corruption + hypercapitalism = ridiculousness.  I've seen footage of stuff like ERA bricks with wood instead of explosives.  Oof.

The second is just the massive disparity in training & leadership.  After 2014 most of the UA rotated out people from combat zones so that you had a ton of people with experience & they had western advisors training; RU has mostly crappy conscripts and unmotivated troops in general.

Finally, the sheer *amount* of losses the Russian army has taken has basically eaten away much of its modern equipment.

Which is why Putin will never fathom or accept the damage he's done. Ukrainians aren't three-dimensional people with hopes, dreams, memories, desires and personalities like he is. Hell, his own troops aren't people either - he will throw as many people into the meat grinder as he can, as long as it means he can win. 

Which is why it's important that he loses. Men like him won't ever take responsibility for atrocities they've committed - they've disillusioned themselves into thinking they're the hero of the story. They're physically unable to perform introspection - to even consider the idea of failure is to destroy themselves.

Having said that, keep in mind the measures that the government has needed to take to achieve the stabilization:

1) More than doubling interest rates to 20% (!) 

2) Shuttering the stock exchange, chocking off fire sales but also new investments that might help growth

3) Announcing intentional defaults on loans and an exit from most lending markets (this is definitely helping the ruble, as investors from China know that the foreign currency reserves backing the ruble will not be spent servicing debt). 

So most of the measures are designed to secure short term stability at a cost of long term health. The Russians were banking on being able to end the Ukranian invasion and reverse sanctions/find alternatives quickly. That does not appear to be happening, meaning that while they might save the ruble, the economic damage will be felt in other ways as market closures and sky high interest and inflation wipe out people with business loans, mortgages or who need these things.

Ukraine keeping DNR and LNR. And Russia gaining Crimea. Feel pretty shitty, since it actually gains Russia territory as part of this invasion. But I suppose it also feels bad for Russia to have to reverse their recognition of DNR and LNR as independent.

So maybe both sides disliking the tearms does actually make it a good compromise.

But, Ukraine will want Crimea returned. And Russia will want Ukraine sworn to a demilitarized state (defenseless for when Russia launches round 2). Neither side wants to give in on either point until they think the war is unwinnable... We'll see.

>...none of these developments validate Putin’s claims that the war is about “denazifying” Ukraine. Forget about Zelensky’s Jewish background: It’s an ironic claim for Putin to make, since he gives safe haven to individuals such as Rinaldo Nazzaro, who was until recently the leader of the Base, a largely American cell-based neo-Nazi organization whose members have been linked to terrorist plots. Nazarro appears to have lived in Russia since at least 2018. Putin has also given haven to the Russian Imperialist Movement, which the State Department describes as giving “paramilitary-style training to white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Europe.” Putin gives these entities haven to help “aggravate societal fissures in the West,” a declassified U.S. intelligence report from last year suggested. Whatever sparse kernels of truth Putin is picking at regarding groups like Azov, it was he who invaded a sovereign country and created a new extremist breeding ground.

>In many ways, the Ukraine situation reminds me of Syria in the early and middle years of the last decade. Just as the Syrian conflict served as a perfect breeding ground for groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, similar conditions may be brewing in Ukraine for the far right. Syria became a plotting and training ground for terrorists to mount attacks in the West, such as the attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 attacks.

I don't think it is anything people are ignoring as much as postponing. Furthermore it also sounds like AB was part of an ongoing problem for both Ukraine and Russia for the past 8 years, and mostly in the contested areas where there had always been fighting. The only Ukraine citizen i know, when i asked her about them, said that they were actually supported by in some ways and spying for russians (which would go along with putins other international supporting of nazis). 

It's an issue for sure, but it's better to have the free speech even if that means you have to deal with people whose speech you despise...and even whose speech constitute a threat to others. 

Dealing with nazi's that depend on free speech to survive seems like a much more existential threat than dealing with the russian invaders who mean to deprive everyone of free speech and every thing else, including life.",False,1647452601.0,t3_tflbi9,t1_i0wn14z,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Napoleon had seen France rise and fall, then rise and fall twice in a lifetime. He was right. Collective belief matters. Ukraine's military successes really demonstrate both the feeble state of Russia's army, the powerful nature of NATO weapons, and perhaps most of all, the power of morale. I don't think Russia would be doing half as badly if they believed in this war. And I don't think Ukrainians would even have a country anymore if they didn't believe in it enough to fight and die.

For getting the MiG-29s into Ukraine, it would almost certainly require Polish pilots (or another NATO member) to fly them into Ukraine and then have Ukraine put appropriate modifications on them (along with reprogramming IFF).

Second, there is a substantial amount of SAMs present and operational in Ukraine on both sides, which makes operating aircraft difficult. One of the reasons it's theorized that Russia is unable to make full use of many of their jets/bombers/etc is that they are afraid of friendly fire. Their air defense crews aren't well trained. This was observed in 2014 when they shot Malaysia Airlines flight 17.

And to add to 3, the avionics on the SU-27 and SU-35 are substantially superior to that of the MiG-29, making it risky to operate them in BVR engagements.

Russia is much older, but I’m not seeing Putin engaging in the same kind of campaign. Russian nationalists certainly exist, but to the extent that 1930s German nationalists existed? I don’t think so, but I could be wrong. 


It makes me wonder how successful he’ll be in convincing the people to turn in their neighbors and send their sons to die in the war if this assault continues. When will the Russians have enough?

Somehow alot of people dosnt know this. There are people protesting, thousands. But most of them have been arrested, some are facing 15 years. Many of them will be killed inside Russian jail.

I'm not pretending there isn't civilians that isn't against this war. There is always people whom cheers when their government goes to war.

But I have sympathy for the ones that are against it, and gets killed, jailed, removed from their families etc.

I have enormous sympathy and respect for the people of Ukraine. For every child that dies in this conflict, a large piece of humanity is forever lost.

But to show a smidge of humanity for the Russian civilians in this is considered taboo or just plain wrong.

there's at least one Kosovar diplomat who lived through the war who says that even hearing about the war triggers his survivor's guilt. now, she's a diplomat who needs to stay updated, but that isn't the case for other warzone survivors. 

other people just *cannot* mentally deal with it, and still others don't have the time to focus outside of whatever emergency is happening in their lives at this moment.

To answer your question though, there isn’t shit we can do Mr. Saltyseaweed1. I’m not sure if you realize the full scale of a nuke hitting Ukraine and what it does to Europe in general. 

I get it seems like Putin can just do what he want, and that’s exactly how it is. There’s a nonzero chance he pushes the button. Do you know what happens to the world when a billion Europeans need to evacuate because Russia dropped a bomb? Destabilization, the world is over practically. 

Really all we can do is support Ukraine continuously with weapons, information, and aid. And keep sanctioning what we can. If the Russian people rise up, that will quell the conflict. It’s happened multiple times before in Russia. 

Ukraine are holding their own, and I know it would be cool to see the US Navy Seals storm the Kremlin and do to Putin what they did to Bin Laden, but that’s not feasible.

not everyone can deal with explicit imagery. some people have lines for how much they can deal with. 

additionally, too much gorey imagery can desensitize you to human suffering, which has awful effects - for example, Russian state TV is showing explicit imagery of Nazi hangings likely as a way to desensitize Russians to the crimes happening in Ukraine.

NATO and Russia are already right now today, perilously close to a nuclear exchange. As tensions increase, the odds of a largely unintentional nuclear exchange increase dramatically. If Russia and NATO actually fight a war, both are going to have their fingers on the nuclear trigger ready to get their arsenal in the air at a moments notice for fear of losing theirs to a first strike. At this point, one side or the other might make a mistake of some kind and launch their arsenal thinking that they are responding to a first strike.

There are actually hundreds of books written on the subject of nuclear escalation you dont have to take my word for it. It is not guaranteed to happen but there is a very high and unacceptable risk that it would. It has already nearly happened on many many occasions even in times of peace and they are well documented.

 >The Great Purge or the Great Terror (Russian: Большой террор), also known as the Year of '37 (37-ой год, Tridtsat sedmoi god) and the Yezhovshchina ('period of Yezhov'), was Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin's campaign to solidify his power over the party and nation; the purges were also designed to remove the remaining influence of Leon Trotsky as well as other political rivals within the party. It occurred from August 1936 to March 1938. Following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924 a power vacuum opened in the Communist Party. Various established figures in Lenin's government attempted to succeed him.

 >Doris Miller (October 12, 1919 – November 24, 1943) was a United States Navy cook third class who was killed in action during World War II. He was the first black American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the highest decoration for valor in combat after the Medal of Honor. Miller served aboard the battleship West Virginia, which was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers during the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. During the attack, he helped several sailors who were wounded, and while manning an anti-aircraft machine gun for which he had no training, he shot down several Japanese planes.

I would say we are right about at the same point as we were in the weeks leading up to the missile crisis.

Those safeguards exist, but in an actual war many of them are removed to allow the nukes to get in the air at a moments notice should either side detect an incoming first strike. Again it is not guaranteed but the risk is dramatically higher.

I read in a book on nuclear strategy at one point (the odds here are made up because I cant remember the actual numbers) that the risk of a nuclear exchange during any given day in peacetime is something like .00001%, during time of increased tension like now it is .01%, then during an actual war every day it is like 3%. Again numbers are made up but it illustrates a point the author was making. The risk is increased like 10,000 times.

To Russia, the point of a tit for tat would be to escalate to the nuclear level, which is the only level that Russia is on an even footing with NATO.

Point on maths, its not one of my strong suits I have to admit, but that doesn't mean I have to immediately accept someone on twitters view either.   


I have a habit to of playing devils advocate, both on reddit and in real life. Please do not mistake this as being Pro-Putin, I'd like to see him gone and replaced by a thriving democracy in Russia that hopefully would become pro EU in a long enough time frame and be a key player on the world stage. (part of the time burning is I'm currently working my notice at a job whilst being WFH so I have a lot of time to engage in reddit at the moment)   


Right onto my views on Nukes and why specifically an escalation is in no-ones interest.   


In a nutshell we are still working under cold war principles here when it comes to nuclear deterrence and how that effects geopolitics / Ukraine specifically. 

The threat of an escalation is a real one, Putin explicitly drew a red line on day one of the invasion, that was basically if you intervene directly we will use them.   


The threat of a nuclear escalation is what has broadly kept the nuclear powers out of direct conflict with each other ever since . however this doesn't stop them engaging in indirect conflict which is what we are seeing here now, arming Ukraine / providing NATO intel / unleashing economic sanctions on Russia are all weakening its position without directly calling that bluff. 

As such I think the course we are doing now is the appropriate one, it is destroying his ability to wage war and making the war harder to wage due to the hardware that has already made its way to Ukraine.   


That bluff I do not think its rational to call, if you call it and you are wrong you have gambled with everyone and lost that bet. It is not a decision that anyone gets to make on the behalf of everyone else.   


It's also why NATO / US is taking the same view that I am, which is why a NFZ / Boots on the ground was explicitly ruled out before the conflict even began.   


I also agree with you that Putin is not irrational / insane, but has made a huge miscalculation with how invading Ukraine would go.   


My reasoning on calling that bluff not being a good idea, is that in nuclear deterrence when you draw a explicit red line like that and do not back it up with following through, you have just weakened the perception of your nuclear deterrence and at the end of the day, your perception is what drives your nuclear deterrence as using them would actually be insane.

In a nutshell there isn't that is the power that having a nuclear arsenal and threating to use them gives you, inherently if you a minor nation (In this instance I mean minor as not a nuclear armed power, it is no dig at Ukraine) you will always be at risk for a Nuclear power deciding to do what it wants without the real risk of intervention by anybody else.

d9f8e6a757b9f39217c8ab0c53065385,tflbi9,i0xb0i8,"Okay.  So here-in lies the rub.

This is the first time in the nuclear age where one side has directly and openly used the threat of nuclear weapons in their message for a military objective.  It was always an implied threat prior to this.  

The first point we have to address is do we believe Russia's threats to launch nuclear weapons over foreign engagement in Ukraine are credible?  

My answer to this is a resounding no.  Let's look at the evidence we have so far to date and try and understand a little bit about Vlad and what he does and how he does.  

Putin is an 'expert' at PsyOps type stuff.  This isn't surprising given his career in the KGB and his formative years being part of the USSR.  One of this biggest weapons and strengths for the last 10+ years has been psyops type shit.  Whether it is meddling in foreign elections, troll farms on social media, etc.  Putin has been happy to use psychological tools against his enemies (real or perceived) and has largely done so to great effect.  I think we can both agree on this point, yes?

If we agree to that and we further agree it has been by far his most effective tool geopolitically for a long time (his army is clearly a useless pile of dogshit if you want anything other than civilians genocided), they we have to assume he would be using that tool as much as possible here.  In this theater that tool manifests as disinformation, false flags and threats.  In short Putin will SAY a lot of shit Putin will never do (IMHO).  He has already made several threats that certain actions by the west would lead to escalation (sanctions, supply arms, etc.) but none of those escalations have ACTUALLY happened.  

The reason they haven't happened is the only escalation Putin has left is WMD.  He has had multiple lines crossed already and hasn't resorted to those WMD being used (even though he has more than enough).  

The reason he won't use his WMD is because he KNOWS what will happen if he does.  Namely the destruction of the entire world (which he couldn't give a fuck about if it didn't include him).  But the entire world DOES include him, and he knows that.  

If the man wasn't terrified of being killed why would he be holed up in a bunker right now? Why would be sit dozens or more feet from everyone in every single meeting?  He's afraid someone close to him will attempt to end him over this action.  

I firmly believe the reports that the yes-men under Putin mislead him on the calculus on this invasion.  I believe he thought his army and equipment was more capable.  I believe he drank his own koolaid with respect the willingness of the Ukrainian people to rejoin Russia.  I think if he had had the information he has now going into this he would have never tried it in the first place.  (The west's pathetic response to Crimea and MH17 only served to embolden him, more on that later).

Why do I think that, because Putin cares about Putin surviving, and this war puts him in a very precarious position.  If you look at his history, he has always played a cold and calculated long-game.  Putin has never been one for rash decisions.  If you haven't studied his political history give it a read.  He's made some bad decisions before, but never any this catastrophic.  

A lot of folks on here are chalking that up to him suddenly going mad, etc... I don't believe that (but if it is true it lends a LOT of support to nukes being nothing to worry about, because if WE know he's mad, the people around him who have to actually make the launch happen know he's mad and there is no way they do that).

So we have to assume Putin is some level of sane.  We also know he's be paranoid about staying alive and in power and has meticulously managed his career and then entire political system of Russia for years to ensure both of those things.  In what world, short of the west actually invading Russia proper would a man, who has spent so much time on his life decide to just throw it all away?  Bluntly I don't believe he would.  No one has presented any good evidence why he would.   Any questionable support for him making that decision has failed to show any evidence his subordinates would go through with such a request (Russia has a history of NOT following protocol when it comes to launching nukes).

Look at the flip side of the equation, what if anything would Russia (and all the people responsible for launching) gain by doing so... nothing.  Literally nothing.  Not even a Pyrrhic victory.  It would be a Pyrrhic draw as everyone would lose.  if you study game theory you will see that nuclear weapons while big and scary aren't really a threat to the world unless they are in the hands of a TRUE mad man.  

And that brings us back to why NOT calling this bluff is going to kill an awful lot of people (see in my view it isn't just that he won't do it, but that by not calling his bluff we ensure that someone WILL do it, and in our children's life time).

By us not calling his bluff, we are ensuring that more and more countries are going to want nukes.  They saw Ukraine give up theirs and get invaded.  And they saw Russia invade without a single western inflicted casualty inflicted upon them (obviously there are casualties but that are by Russia's choice and hand).  This signals to every 'get nukes'. 

50 years ago, this was fine.  50 years ago it was really hard to make a nuclear weapon.  50 years later it's not so hard anymore.  The technology to make them is widely available, hell you can get plans online.  The material is much harder to source, but not impossible especially if you are look for small numbers of weapons.  Now please don't do what everyone does and take the statement about easy to some hyperbolic extreme to justify a response. Yes it still takes time and effort and the right people, but it's not the insurmountable challenge it was for the last 50 years.  Evidence of this is right there in North Korea, India and Pakistan, the newest members of the nuclear family.  All nations that even 30 years ago would have been unthinkable to develop a nuclear weapon.  

Not calling Putin's bluff is going to be a major driver in a new round of nuclear proliferation.  Every new nation that gets nukes is going to be one more chance a TRUE madman takes over and uses them, and has the result everyone is afraid of in this situation (wiping out the world).

The very TLDR of this is:

1) I don't think Putin is insane/suicidal 

2) Not acting actually increases the chances of a full nuclear war in the relatively near future by driving proliferation.

3) I don't think sane Putin is the type to put his own life on the line for nukes.

Final thought:  Putin is enough of a political operator that if the west engaged in Ukraine directly, it would actually be EASIER for him to pull out and explain it away to his people without losing power.  He could just say 'They intervened and rather than costing our valiant soldiers their lives at the hands of the evil western nazi's, I have brought them home.  I would have loved to have nuked them, but they would have killed all of my wonderful citizens'.",False,1647459929.0,t3_tflbi9,t1_i0x29pl,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Those countries specifically (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova) are sadly indefensible with NATO brinksmanship and deterrence. NATO cannot credibly defend them.

NATO can and has however drawn a line in the sand at Finland, Sweden, and NATO itself. Russia will absolutely bluster and threaten these countries, but he absolutely will not attack them. He is taking what he can according to nuclear brinksmanship, and arguably he might not even be able to take Ukraine in the first place.

Thats the cold reality of nuclear brinksmanship. NATO can draw lines in the sand (which they did not do in Ukraine) and then make their intent absolutely clear that they will defend those lines (which they have).

Hell, we got five to one missile superiority as it is. We could easily assign three missiles to every target and still have a very effective reserve force for any other contingency...An unofficial study which we undertook of this eventuality, indicate that we would destroy ninety percent of their nuclear capabilities. We would therefore prevail and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian casualties from the remaining force which would be badly damaged and uncoordinated.
