Why this matters: This is significant because the Norwegian government owns two-thirds of Equinor, according to the company's website.

Here is a round-up of the latest headlines:

Talks between Ukraine and Russia got under way on the border with Belarus this morning. Ukraine had agreed to talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday.

Recent British intelligence appears to corroborate a recent report from Ukraine’s military that Russia had “slowed down” its offensive. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russia’s advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance.
The Russian central bank has increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday in the wake of western sanctions.

The EU is expecting Ukraine’s application to join the European Union “imminently” and officials in Brussels said “this will need to be assessed very rapidly by the council and the decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the European Commission”.

Residents in Mariupol this morning said the port city on the Sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack.
Amnesty International has condemned Russia’s reported use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, saying an attack on a pre-school “may constitute a war crime”.

Russian invasion forces seized two small cities in south-eastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as Moscow’s diplomatic and economic isolation deepened.

The UK government announced a slew of measures “to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund, and the country’s ministry of finance”.

The Russian rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the US dollar on Monday as markets opened for trading on the first day after western nations announced punishing economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it will send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House.

At least 102 civilians in Ukraine have been killed since Russia launched its invasion last Thursday, with a further 304 injured, but the real figure is feared to be “considerably higher”, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday.

An update from Ukraine’s interior ministry late last night said 352 Ukrainian civilians have so far been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. The ministry said a further 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded.

Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv early on Monday morning, Ukraine’s state service of special communications reported. Meanwhile, about 150km north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the centre of the city, causing a fire to break out, the agency added.

About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday.

Forty Ukrainian civil society groups have come together to call on the West to establish safe zones for refugees inside Ukraine, and provide technology to help document Russian war crimes as part of a plan to make Vladimir Putin and his inner circle face justice at the international criminal court.

The talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on the Belarusian border have ended, according to Ukraine's parliament. 

The meeting was aimed at achieving an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, the Ukrainian presidency said earlier. 

We will wait to see if anything has come of the meeting.

Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Kyiv's interior minister, wrote on Facebook that Moscow's troops had bombarded residential areas with Grad missiles, saying: ""Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded!

""The whole world must see this horror! Death to the occupiers!""

It is not possible at this stage to say exactly how many civilians have been killed so far. The UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said earlier today that at least 102 civilians had been killed, with a further 304 people injured.

""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher,"" Bachlet said.>>

The United States is expanding sanctions on Russia’s central bank in a move that will block Americans from engaging in any transactions with it and freezing any assets it holds in the US.

In a statement today, the US treasury department said the decision would apply to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Russia’s National Wealth Fund – which is run by a close ally of Vladimir Putin – and its Ministry of Finance.

Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said:

The unprecedented action we are taking today will significantly limit Russia’s ability to use assets to finance its destabilizing activities, and target the funds Putin and his inner circle depend on to enable his invasion of Ukraine.

Today, in coordination with partners and allies, we are following through on key commitments to restrict Russia’s access to these valuable resources.”",False,1646052486.0,t3_t3elmo,t3_t3elmo,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

I’ve been speaking to Natalia Balasynovych, the mayor of Vasilkiv, which came under extremely heavy fire as Russian troops tried to disable the air defence system here and capture the airport over recent days.

Asked what she would like to see at the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine currently taking place, Balasynovych said she believed most people in her town would accept a compromise to stop the war.

We would like to see compromise but not a capitulation. Maybe neutral status for Ukraine, if it will stop them shooting now. Because to live like this is not possible.

If they will offer us only the condition of capitulation then we have to fight to the end. But I would like our children never to wake up with these bombs. Our children will have serious trauma, and people are dreaming of peace already.

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.  
>  
>Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.  
>  
>Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said  
>  
>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.  
>  
>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.  
>  
>Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations  
>  
>Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.  
>  
>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.  
>  
>Russia formed a delegation for negotiations with Ukraine  
>  
>Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.  
>  
>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.  
>  
>Russia agreed to Ukraine to organize negotiations, Peskov said  
>  
>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.  
>  
>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.  
>  
>Russia's rights in the Council of Europe suspended  
>  
>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.  
>  
>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.  
>  
>No one in Europe wants to fight Russia, French defense minister says  
>  
>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",1646057451.0,1646057381.0,t3_t3elmo,t3_t3elmo,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

In the lead up to the invasion, they were running all sorts of stories explaining why Russia was being all but forced to invade Ukraine, historical justifications, Ukrainians and Russians are one people--same stuff we hear from TASS, RIA-Novosti, and Putin. I think a lot of leftists and non-conformist types in the west tend to default to believing al-Jazeera because of their often very good reporting on certain issues around the world, showing a different perspective, etc but make no mistake--it's run by oil billionaires who have lavish flats in London and are just as mean to the barista at Starbucks as your average Goldman Sachs finance bro. The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend.

That having been said, there is definitely a pretty significant undercurrent of racism that runs through Ukrainian/Russian/Polish/European culture. No getting around that. I wouldn't be totally surprised if these guys were actually doing the pork fat (or salo, which is delicious, btw) thing, since the Azov Battalion, which makes up part of the Ukrainian National Guard, has a checkered past with neo-nazi sympathizers (but also, not just neo-nazis--paradoxically, there are/were Jewish officers in the group! the post-Soviet space is WILD!). On the other hand, this is a weird moral panic/conspiracy theory that has shown up at several points in world history. Look up the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857! 

And, finally, for further context, Kadyrov's Chechen fighters are very, very, very bad people. He's arguably even more repressive than Putin. Not that this justifies racism, but I suspect the context of why Kadyrov might be so despised is something that al-Jazeera is not likely to report.

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And, of course, in the fourth, internal Russian dimension. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about this separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at great cost, yes, through the tragic events of the actual civil war, because now the brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other - but there will be no more Ukraine as the anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical wholeness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we were to abandon this, if we were to allow the temporary division to take hold for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but we would be damned by our descendants - for having allowed the Russian land to disintegrate.

Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin has taken on - without a bit of exaggeration - a historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to resolve it would always remain a major problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, i.e. the creation of Ukraine as an anti-Russia and an outpost for Western pressure on us, is only the second in importance among them.
The first would always remain a complex of divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to put up with the existence of two states no longer one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon its history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash their teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine. Bringing Ukraine back, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with each passing decade - the recoding, derussification of Russians, and the setting against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of Ukraine by the West were consolidated, its return to Russia would become impossible at all - the Atlantic bloc would have to fight for it.

Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine are with national formations
Now this problem does not exist - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be restructured, re-established and returned to its natural state as part of the Russian world. In what borders, in what form will the union with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.
And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns the relations between Russia and the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, the three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting geopolitically as one whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And it loudly resents this, although deep in its heart it must admit that it couldn't be otherwise.

Russia has formed a delegation to negotiate with Ukraine
Did anyone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up on Kiev? That the Russians would forever be a divided people? And at the same time that Europe is uniting, when German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe was only possible thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. To take a swing at the Russian land after that is the top of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe separately, did not have the strength to keep in its sphere of influence, let alone to take Ukraine. Not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.
More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is coming back.

Russian army has portable crematorias + flamethrowers, and it'll help to hide losses, and I think, there'll be smth like Grozny case, but without  rocket attacks. Simply put - he'll stop care about soldiers lifes (it's not like he cares now tho) and start trying to capture any important city/military base using soldiers as a cannon fodder. But maybe it'll be Grozny case, and he'll throw some missiles in the Kiyv, but I can't believe he cares about soldiers more than rating. Also don't forget that most of the best russians commanders are now in the Syria. It's literally the first time I see guy who's controlling General Staff lol.

I think Russia is slowly dying. They have a smaller economy than California. Their population is shrinking. They have not kept up with the modern world in many ways. I think Putin realizes this. I think he is doing this because he feels like the world is closing in on him. With all that said….I support a free Ukraine. I wish them the very best in their fight against the Russians, but the USA and its allies need to approach this very carefully. This isn’t Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Vietnam, or North Korea. I don’t know exactly how important Ukraine is to Putin, but it is clearly very, very important. I think it’s a situation where he will take Ukraine at any cost. So here is my ultimate fear. I think this situation has made it very clear to the world how much of a paper tiger Russia’s military is. They simply could not fight a conventional war with the US or Nato. They would be annihilated. They can hardly take Ukraine. I think this is obvious to Putin. My fear is that if anything happens that he even thinks might trigger a NATO response…he will order a nuclear strike. It’s all Russia has... He knows Nato would end Russia and I believe he would take the world down, before letting Russia fall. Of course, Nato doesn’t want a war with Russia. I think all sides need to take a step back here. Deescalate…We are seeing the world from two completely different points of view. Nato doesn’t want yo end Russia…and I doubt the Russian people want a nuclear war.

It’s my understanding that NATO is unpopular with the Russian people themselves. Like how al-Qaeda is unpopular with Americans. It’s not without historical reason, either. Putin’s messaging regarding NATO isn’t actually directed at the West. It’s speaking to the Russian people. Sorry to use a Hitler analogy, but it is just like Hitler: his rhetoric voiced the grievances of Germans, which is why they backed him. 

The Russian Boomer-equivalent generation lived a significant portion of their lives during the Cold War and their parents were personally affected by the war on the Eastern Front. Know how Boomers go into a rage when they hear socialism talk about in even a remotely positive way? I imagine Boomer Russians have a similar visceral reaction when they hear NATO not be taken as a threat or talked about in any positive manner. 

Even though that population is aging out, I’m not sure the views of younger Russians are much warmer towards the West. The dissolution of the USSR was an economic collapse for Russia. Putin was elected in that post-collapse environment. He was seen as someone who would stabilize the country. And Russia has improved economically under him—even if it’s a bit lope-sided—from it’s rock-bottom days during the 90s.

Obviously, Putin needs to go just like Hitler needed to go. There’s still the issue of the grievances of the Russian people at the end of all this. We can’t expect those grievances to just disappear all own their own. That’s how we treated it in the 90s. Now we’re in this situation.

Putin wants to look like he got a win of some sort and weakened western powers. The only way for him to do that is control of Ukraine. At best he would need large territorial concessions (I.e. Donetsk, Luhansk, and everything between then and Crimea) and some sort of guarantee Ukraine won’t join NATO. Note this would still be a huge loss (especially with NATO galvanized), but Putin’s propaganda machine likely could work with it. 

Zelenskyy on the other hand not only wants Russia out, but probably wants major concessions to make up for the trillions of dollars in damage to the country and its infrastructure. At best he might give up the previously contested areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The Russians did not have a plan B for logistics (edit: at least not a plan B that would work without air superiority).  The Ukrainian Air force (and ground to air systems) holding up longer than anyone would expect is HUGE.  This is largely due to being fed radar data from surrounding allies.

Ukraine's neighbors can still read the sky, and Russia can't do anything about it.

The few elite professionals they have  are being pushed into merc companies to reward the wealthy but also so putin can copy bush jr with blackwatch and the deniability mercs provide for war crimes!

—-

The Russian post-war plan for Ukraine, accidentally posted on state media as an oped, in English (this is from Apple Translate, I can't speak Russian so this may miss some nuances):

A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible. Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646052812.0,t3_t3elmo,t1_hyrsxfx,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

They can't even bomb Ukrainian cities like in previous conflicts, because the countries of those previous wars didn't have a modern army or a huge population (the bigger was Syria with 15+ million), here in Ukraine, they risk pissing off 44 million ready to grab modern weaponry supplied by the west.

Unfortunately pictures and videos have a way of having the opposite effect, almost as if your brain fights back and tells you it can't be real. Disemboweled bodies start to look like movie props and videos of people losing their lives play in front of you with the same brevity of a random commercial.

I think it is important that people see these things, but I think everyone's capacity for it is different and extremely varied. Those of us who aren't there will never understand just what is happening but it's important we know something is happening.

On day 1 I was consuming any and all media that came out of Ukraine, because I wanted to understand as much as possible about what is happening, because if I can't control anything I at least want to know what to expect.

Imagine the US going to war with un-modernised 1980s equipment, a NCO corps that doesn't retain a lot of combat veterans, doesn't propagate a lot of traditions and institutional knowledge about warfighting, and doesn't give a crap about the men they lead. An officer corps that attitudinally leans toward sacrificing lives en masse rather than looking for ways (technologically or doctrinally) to mitigate risk. A logistics train whose capability is tiny relative to the needs of the combatant elements they're supposed to supply.

Part of the reason US forces focused so heavily on precision strike is because they study the hell out of their past conflicts (WW2, Korea, Vietnam) and came to the conclusion that area-bombing the shit out of cities wasn't nearly as effective as those raids where they focused on specific targets that directly impacted opposition command and control, communications and logistics. So after Vietnam they spent giant piles of money developing precision-guided weapons, low-observables, and ISR capabilities to help identify where to best put those munitions to screw up the enemy's communications and combat effectiveness. Russia didn't get those kinds of lessons and simply hasn't invested in it as much.

I want/wish for Ukraine to be able to at least hold, I want them to have a chance. But Russia also has more weaponry and more men elsewhere in Russia that they have not brought out. Also - whilst you can get more weaponry and the EU etc.  are supplying Ukraine with them, the human toll and exhaustion will have an effect the longer this will go on. 

The reason I think this will go on for longer is that unless Putin is dethroned by his own entourage (very very unlikely) or he backs down (also very very unlikely, because it would be a total humiliation and he'd never accept that) or the rest of the big players stop supporting him and start actively and vocally opposing him - China, India, Brazil, etc. - I don't see him stopping this by himself.

It's clear now that Ukrainian capabilities were better than Russia expected, and Russian unit readiness was far below what Russia expected. Russia's best chance of winning was a blitzkrieg strike that took Kyiv while Ukraine was still surprised. 

That didn't happen. So now Ukraine is fully mobilized and getting overt help from Western nations. At the same time, Russian logistics are struggling to keep its forces supplied in hostile territory. So if it turns into a war of attrition now, Ukraine wins. 

But Putin knows that if the Russians keep doing things the same way, they lose. He sacked Russia's top general yesterday. So look for Putin to change something big. What will they do? Aerial bombing of the cities? Very large [thermobaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon) weapons? Nukes?

All governments with weapons will have a readiness policy that covers the events directly following a nuclear attack on a friendly. This won't be something pulled out of someone ass, they will have a plan, because they know that if and when it happens no one will be in the right mind to make a decision about something like this. These plans will likely be revised regularly, and would probably have been adjusted during this crisis. They were, reportedly, many times during the Cold War.
2. Potentially, but it's difficult. The media are presenting this very much as Putin's War, not Russia's war. So killing a bunch of Russians with Nukes isn't likely to help things. if Putin launches Nukes he will be safely in a bunker where they wouldn't touch him.
3. A full on Assault of Russia is definitely a possibility in that scenario, but there are greater political risks in doing so. China certainly wouldn't be thrilled if the US and EU rolled up and redistributed Russia. Equally they wouldn't be thrilled if we all start throwing Nukes like they're water balloons.
4. Depends what you mean by destroying the world. Infrastructure would be fucked in most places. We would have a nuclear winter for sure. Most places would be inhospitable, but it depends where he aims them. Would it crack the earth like an egg? No. But would we be fighting the next world war with sticks and rocks, probably. 
5. No, it's not feasible to stop 6000 Nukes. Stopping one mid flight is pretty hard. It gets exponentially harder the more there are. Especially after the first drops. The confusion and panic would be overwhelming. 

Ultimately, all we know is based on predictions and calculations from the effects of nuclear impacts done in testing scenarios. It's hard to know for sure exactly what would happen. We can simulate all day, but there's no way to know for sure until it happens.

It wasn't good, any many Americans consider W a war criminal to this day.

There are a lot of similarities.

But there are also some differences.

The United States claimed (in what we now know was a lie) that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was using chemical weapons on his own people.  The United States also built a coalition of nations around the world who believed the US Intel regarding WMDs.  The United States declared no intention of breaking off a piece of Iraq to form a separate country.  Although, it did have claims of liberating the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein, which no one would argue against the statement that he was a dictator and that Iraq did not have free and fair elections.  The American justification for war in Iraq was terrible, but Saddam Hussein was a dictator.

In Ukraine, Russia **unilaterally** decided to declare two territories as independent, obtained *no* buy-in from the world community, and *immediately* invaded.  By now, Belarus, a Russian puppet, may have recognized Donbas independence from Ukraine, but no one else has or will.  Russia has also made claims that Zelensky, one of only two Jewish world leaders, is a Nazi and not a representative of the Ukrainian people.  The sane world recognizes Ukraine as a functional democracy with Zelensky as its democratically elected leader.

I think Navalny leading a revolution would ultimately be just as dangerous as Putin continuing his administration. And we need to be careful not to embrace the enemy of our enemy because it tends to bite us. The consensus seems to be that people mostly know Navalny for standing up to Putin and releasing damaging information (along with surviving assassination attempts). Unfortunately, it gets worse once the veneer washes off.


Edit: just to clarify, the above isn’t an excuse to have Putin retain power. I just worry that people think Navalny is someone who he isn’t. He can still be a victim of Putin’s wrath *and* a piece of shit ethno-nationalist. And Russia has certainly put propaganda efforts into spreading the ethnic-nationalist bit, but they can only do so because of repeated statements and demonstrations he’s made over the years.

As a (non-native) Russian speaker, I can say that I can pretty reliably understand written Ukrainian and can often get the gist of spoken Ukrainian if I know the context. Part of this, though, might be because I had to study *gulp* Old Church Slavonic, the medieval literary language of Eastern Europe, which has some characteristics that Ukrainian maintains. If I were better at my job, I’d be able to explain what they are but mostly it’s like, I squint at a Ukrainian tweet and I’m like “ahh… this kind of makes sense.”

However, because Russian was the official language of the Soviet Union, I’ll generalize and say that most everyone who went to school under the Soviets anywhere in the USSR can speak and understand Russian to a greater or lesser extent. So, lots of older Ukrainians will have full fluency, even in places where Russian isn’t the daily language as much anymore. In addition, because of the prevalence of Russian in the region and on the internet, lots of younger Ukrainians develop fluency more or less, or can at least understand it. 

Finally, there is a mixed register of Russian and Ukrainian that has existed since time immemorial (the writer Nikolai Gogol, whom I really recommend, used it to great effect in the 19th century) that many people speak and seems mostly intelligible to people all over the former Soviet Union.

Those submunitions don't always explode.

Assume that each submunition has a 99.99% success rate for detonating.  That means 1 out of every 10,000 lands unexploded.  The US Army's MLRS system, the M270, carries a pack of 12 missiles on every launch vehicle.  Each missile carries between about 400 and 600 submunitions, depending on the actual missile being fired.  Call it 500.  That means every salvo from every launcher carries 6,000 submunitions downrange.  Or in other words, every other time it fires, it leaves live ordnance on the ground, probably just under the surface from impact.  And they typically operate in batteries of around 9 launchers (108 missiles, 54,000 bomblets) at a time.

Now, think about what the actual real-world failure rate for the submunitions:  ~2%.

The issue is that I don't think that justifies attacking places they might hide where other civilians without guns are. But when the number of people fighting back and creating weapons is large,it can justify calling all those people combatants too.

But since they're civilians, they obviously go home too they aren't ever truly ""deployed"". It's not like you can create a clear line between civilian and combatant when these people aren't part of a structured military. And it's not like these people are the only ones in the cities, with all true 100% civilians in some designated zone.

The grey space created by militarizing the civilian population opens them up to some serious exposure when air superiority is lost and when shelling and bombing of cities occurs. 

One could argue that air raids are indiscriminate in cities at all times also however, so who knows.

And then there's the whole ""this is wrong but so was the US bombing of cities in Afghanistan and Iraq"". Which is true, and they used the whole ""insurgent fighter hiding"" excuse too. As does Israel pretty often citing Hamas when shelling buildings in Palestine.

I guess what I'm saying is, it's messy to have anyone but military fighting. And actively encouraging it makes it messier.

It doesn't make Russia right either. But it does expose civilians to greater risk. Even those who are pacifist and don't want to actively fight, directly support as part of a supply line or engage in battle in any other way. 

In general I feel like this whole situation is terribly sad. I think people defending themselves is fine, don't get me wrong. And if Russia hadn't invaded we wouldn't even be having this discussion. But it does, for me, put into more perspective app the American stuff they did in the middle east when I was younger. The justifications were different, and many of them were more broadly supported in the west than what Russia has now, but the whole ""enemy insurgents"" angle takes on a new perspective for me.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan

> The surrender of Imperial Japan was announced by Japanese Emperor Hirohito on August 15 and formally signed on September 2, 1945, bringing the hostilities of World War II to a close. By the end of July 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had become incapable of conducting major operations and an Allied invasion of Japan was imminent. Together with Great Britain and China, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction"". While publicly stating their intent to fight on to the bitter end, Japan's leaders (the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War, also known as the ""Big Six"") were privately making entreaties to the publicly neutral Soviet Union to mediate peace on terms more favorable to the Japanese. While maintaining a sufficient level of diplomatic engagement with the Japanese to give them the impression they might be willing to mediate, the Soviets were covertly preparing to attack Japanese forces in Manchuria and Korea (in addition to South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands) in fulfillment of promises they had secretly made to the United States and the United Kingdom at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences.",False,1646055535.0,t3_t3elmo,t1_hyrwdl6,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Source:  Worked in banking half a lifetime ago.

Banks, at least in the US, are required to keep a minimum of 10% of their assets on-hand as liquid cash.  This does not mean what you think it means.

If you deposit ten bucks in cash to your checking account, the bank can loan out $90 in ""pretend cash,"" basically, because there's that ten bucks backing it.  That money then makes interest for the bank at a far higher rate than if you had, say, put it into one of the bank's account plans that actually provide an interest rate.

Effectively, freezing the assets of a bank means they are down to (roughly) ten percent of their assets as something they can use to do business.  And if people want their money, the banks literally do not have enough cash on-hand to provide it for them.

Our tellers had a cash drawer limit of $10k (some bigger banks go as high as $100k from my experience).  The vaults typically held a few million at most.  We had accounts that literally had more money than the vault at any given time.  Multiple accounts.

Quite a few experts believe that in times of deteriorating relations between Russia and the EU,[220] Ukraine has a window of opportunity to join the European Union. Pavlo Klimkin noted that Ukraine still does not meet any criteria for joining the European Union, as it does not have an established democracy, rule of law and a full-fledged market economy. According to him, the first chance was lost in early 2005, when Yushchenko was persuaded not to apply, and in 2014 it was much more difficult to do so.[221]

On 11 February 2021, the European Parliament published a report on Ukraine's success in implementing the Association Agreement with the European Union.

Beyond the capitals, many major cities and towns around Australia had protests.[76]

At protests in Australia in Bellingen, New South Wales around 2,500 people (SW estimate) joined a rally at the towns sports ground. As well as hearing from speakers, the demonstrators were entertained by a group of a cappella singers called 'The Bushbombs'. The rally was about as large as the town's population.[11]

New Zealand
The first actual demonstration of the day took place in New Zealand where 10,000 people demonstrated in Auckland and Wellington. The Auckland march was bigger than expected, forcing police to shut off Queen Street. People were reported to be still starting the march as those at the front of the march reached a rally in Myers Park several kilometres away. In Wellington the march had to carry on after the then planned end point as there were too many people to fit into the park. Around 400 to 500 people marched in Hamilton.[77] There were also protests in at least 18 other centres, including Dunedin, Thames, Opotiki, Whakatane, Whangarei, Timaru and Rotorua, and Picnic for Peace in Christchurch.[14][78]",False,1646055752.0,t3_t3elmo,t1_hyrw5yg,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

You’re from North Carolina and have experienced and seen that good ole boy southern racism. I’m not excusing racism in any form, and I acknowledge that the Ukrainian far right in Azov battalion exists and has troubling beliefs. 

At the same time, what the west reports as widespread Ukrainian racism is somewhat a red herring. Every time you see a post complaining about Banderites (red and black flag) or Nazi iconography, the source misses crucial cultural context. While Hitler was getting into power in Nazi Germany 1932-1933, my family and millions others were starved to death during the holodomor. This isn’t often taught about, and I only learned of it through my family since in the states I was never taught about it. By some estimates as many Ukrainians were starved as Jews were gassed.

There was a resistance that fought against the (largely ethnic Russian) Soviets during, before, and after this time, and when the Nazis invaded Ukraine a handful of years after millions of Ukrainians were starved to death by their own government some Ukrainians treated them as liberators for hopefully self evident reasons. Eventually Banderites split from the Nazis and fought a war against both sides. Were atrocities committed? Yes, I don’t deny this. But to paint everybody who identifies with that resistance (as problematic as it was) as dyed in the wool white supremacists is disingenuous considering the historical context and the fact that once again Ukrainians are being invaded by Russians, and now Chechen volunteers.",False,1646057436.0,t3_t3elmo,t1_hys0no8,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Putin is currently offering essentially nothing in negotiations. They fall apart and the ground war continues.

The general assuming command promises to hold free and fair elections with outside observers permitted in return for immediate sanction relief, followed by another round of relief after the election.

Russia elects its first good leader since Gorbechov, who starts paving the way to nationalising Gazprom, dials back military spending and starts modernizing his country.
