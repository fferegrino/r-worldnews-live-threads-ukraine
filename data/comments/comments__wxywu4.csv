>He said it took them 10 days to run north from Mariupol, and they had to fight their way through Russian positions. One old woman gave them food but told them to be careful because her grandson joined the DPR and if he saw them he’d kill her and them.

>He also said they had to leave Mariupol because they had run out of food and water. The people in Azovstal would break through the lines in cars and drive to them to supply them with food, but they couldn’t do it frequently enough and they had run out.

>When they decided to leave, they broke through the line with a few tanks with the rest of the tankers fighting as infantry, they drove until they ran out of fuel, then destroyed the tanks and ran the rest of the way on foot.

Day 184 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet again, and it would have been completely quiet if not for the missile strike. They fired their missiles as usual, at 2am, and this time they did manage to make it to the city. Also just before the missiles strike they shelled our city from MLRS. The rockets made it here just before the missiles arrived.

This time they aimed their missiles right at the center of Kharkiv, and they hit nothing, the missile landed on the road, near the sidewalk. There are already videos from the place that was hit, and there is nothing military related anywhere around it, unless a lamppost counts as a military vehicle.

Thankfully there were no casualties, but pretty much every window that is somewhat close to the place of impact was shattered. The worst part is that the missile landed not even 10 meters away from an apartment building. If the missile landed just a couple meters to the side there would have been a lot of civilian casualties.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 August 2022



- On 24 August 2022, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation that Russia was deliberately slowing the pace of its military campaign in Ukraine, driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties.


- This is almost certainly deliberate misinformation. Russia's offensive has stalled because of poor Russian military performance and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Under Shoigu's orders, the forces operating in Ukraine have repeatedly missed planned operational timelines. It is highly likely that Shoigu and President Putin have fired at least six generals for not advancing quickly enough.


- On the day Shoigu was speaking, a Russian SS-26 Iskander short-range ballistic missile struck a train in the town of Chaplyne, reportedly killing at least two children. This highlights Russia's willingness to cause collateral damage when it perceives there is military advantage in launching missile or artillery strikes.",1661492519.0,1661491619.0,t3_wxywu4,t3_wxywu4,,0,97,0,97,1,0,

You are mistaken. It takes 15 shots to engage an enemy airplane and it carries ~600 pieces of ammunition to engage planes with (depending on loadout) It does not fire unless it has a 90% plus hit probability and in all training exercises the number has never been lower than 93%.

A small left fraction of the party released a paper in which they want the escalation to stop and return to negotiations. 

Complete non-starter and can be seen as such. It does not represent the party line as a whole. This kind of media representation is problematic in my opinion , since it implies a huge fracture in the ruling party where there actually is none. Differing opinions are voiced all the time from left, right and center positions. These 'oh my god support for Ukraine is dwindling!!111'-articles serve no real purpose other than generating clicks.

WELT (See source below), which is right-leaning and not always the best source, at least lists the people who have signed the document. These are 3 Bundestagsabgeordnete (members of German parliament), 3 members of European parliament, several politicians from a lower level (out of the parliament of the seperate Bundesländer) and 2 mayors. So an absolute minority in all regards and this get's blown absolutely out of proportion and people from other countries may not always check this in depth and only see 'Germany seizes support for Ukraine'. Nearly every major German news  outlet has an article for this and it's just shitty journalism in my opinion. :(

Other Germans believe we should stop supporting Ukraine in order to force them to give up and let Putin take their land, and call this ""force Ukraine to negotiate \[an unconditional surrender\]"". They usually state something like ""I want cheap Russian energy"" as their motivation and maybe something about ""war is bad, anything else is better than war"" (but they won't mention that there is a high chance of ethnic cleansing / genocide happening everywhere if Putin controls Ukraine, and their democracy would be gone of course).

Some of them just feel that this war is terrible and horrible and losing some Ukrainian land is not a big deal, really. The big issue is ""why would Putin stop after gaining some land?"" of course, and I don't think those Germans have thought about that question. Otherwise I'd agree if Germany was under attack: If we could give up the land where I live to the attacking country, and I simply move to some other place in Germany, and then we'd have some kind of guarantee that it will never happen again and no more suffering and daily deaths – I'd actually take that offer, even though it is ridiculously unfair.

The Russian logistical system relies heavily upon train networks which have been at least partially unavailable to them in the invasion. If you look at the the current borders of the Invasion, they are all at about the same distance that the Russian truck supply convoys can bring them from the border with Russia, logistical support basically stops there. 

The Russian Battalion tactical group has a gigantic host of different equipment. Logistics vehicles, transport, tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers etc. Its all smashed into one big unit together... yet they have something like half the number of trucks as a comparably sized US army infantry battalion. 

This makes sense logistically for a massive nation with huge rail networks, who mostly would have to worry about getting invaded, but now that Russia has decided to invade another nation? the limits of their transport truck fleet has been tested. This also means that losses of even a few transport/logistical vehicles is MASSIVE since they are already at a defect. Thus Russia has clearly been forced to co-opt civilian vehicles and defunct soviet ones to replace their losses. More so than tanks or APC's, the loss of simple trucks has been probably single largest slowdown for any offensive operations for the Russians..",False,1661550385.0,t3_wxywu4,t1_ilwysll,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

Mass jamming not only affects the frequency bands remotely-piloted drones operate, it degrades or kills off radios.   As an example, with most Russian units relying on commercial-grade radios or cellphones to communicate with command units meant that a broad, persistent EW jamming led to a communication blackout, which was only ameliorated by a halt on jamming being ordered.

Then, there's the conscription factor.   EW specialists are amongst the most highly trained and respected troops in Western armies.   That expertise has to be cultivated and grown over time with plenty of training.   The Russians just can't sustain that with their conscription model.  Anyone who would be competent at performing the work required in EW is more than likely going to leap from the army as soon as their term is over than they are to stick around.   Thus, their EW tactics have to be simplified accordingly.

>but are otherwise lower calibre than pretty much any machine gun? Do you have any idea how much additional weight you'd be carrying if you were to wear a vest protecting you from machine gun fire?

RPK comes in 5.45x39 (standard AK-74 round)
M249, MG4, MG-36, M-27IAR, H-BAR and more come in 5.56x45 (standard NATO round).

While there are 7.62 NATO and 7.62x54r machineguns, there are plenty that share the same caliber with usual assault rifles.

>If such vests even do exist, and I am fairly sure they don't, I imagine that fielding an entire army as standard issue, with these, would be wasteful and generally stupid by multiple good reasons (mobility, expenditure, usefulness).

NIJ Type III and Type IV exists. Different types of body armor can resist even AP 7.62x54r (PKM / SVD Dragunov rounds). [See here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_body_armor_performance_standards)

Protecting soldiers is never wasteful.

>A vest is for protecting you from a stray bullet or 10 of energy and calibre corresponding to something not more powerful than from the AK-47 rifle, and that's at substantial range. 

False, see above.

>At close range you will have internal bleeding from organ tissue rupture, which may prove as fatal as if the vest wasn't there and the bullet went through you.

The purpose of the padding in the vest is precisely to protect against that by dispersing energy and catching stray fragments.

>Forget about machine guns. We'll need not only an entirely new material for such vest to be feasible, 

About the ""entirely new material"", we already have ceramics, steel alloys, and thermal treatments to increase strenght.

>total collective energy of a machine gun salvo hitting such vest, has to be distributed in a way where it doesn't turn your body into a bag of mixed ruptured tissue and bone fragments suspended in blood.

A full MG (and even AK) salvo hitting a plate ""might"" rupture it, but that is not the purpose of body armor. Getting shot point blank with any automatic weapon might just as well get you hit in the face.",1661503390.0,1661503209.0,t3_wxywu4,t1_iluem44,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

That is a kevlar and spectra ""soft"" vest which then has a ballistic plate inserted into it. The current modular scalable vest system the US army is now issuing can stop a 9 mm handgun round at close range even without the plate. Depending on the plate added it can stop up to an armor piercing 7.62 NATO round, commonly issued ones can easily stop a bullet from an assault rifle at close range.

And it would be far less of an injury than getting hit with a vest and plate on than just taking the bullets. You could easily come away with cracked or broken ribs or even internal injuries like you say, massive bruising is a certainty, but it would still be waaaaay better than just getting hit by the bullet with no protection. Your chance of death is way lower in a proper vest.

And proper plates are some ceramic composite, not a metal plate like we see here. If that Russian vest had no Kevlar or spectra in it with a metal plate that is laughable to give to an infantryman today in a decently equipped army. If that's what Russia is issuing to front line soldiers they absolutely deserve ridicule for it as they're sending them to the front in equipment that was out of date in the  1990's.

I mean there are a huge range of machine guns along with assault rifles. These are really only lose terms used as broad generalities. The military does not use these designations in anyway. 

Also the military specifically has standards set for this. There are listed industry standards and ratings easily available online right now. The military standard is level IV (level 4) body armor. This level of body armor is designed to take up to a 30-06 armor piercing round. Hell even level 3 body armor can stop the standard 7.62x39 and 5.56x45. Both calibers used in the modern infantry rifle. 

On to your ""machine gun"" issue. Let's just go with the two main contenders. Your soviet PKM and your US m249. Right off the top, your m249 shoots the same round as the standard M4 using the 5.56x45 round. So we already know that at least Level 3 can handle this. Including multiple hits. The soviet PKM uses a 7.62x54R. Which is roughly equivalent to the US .308. Smaller than the .30-06 and we know the level 4 vests can handle the more powerful .30-06 so that .308 the pkm is shooting will also be stopped. 

So yes they can stop the bullets. No they were not designed for ricochets or shrapnel. The only vest every designed to only stop that was the flak jacket. Issued all the way back in Vietnam. 

Find me one example, one documented case, or one study that shows someone dying from massive shock trauma from a bulletproof vest. You won't find it. Because it's not a thing that exists outside of whatever fairytale land you heard it from.

There was fear that encouraging Ukraine to fight back in a contest they simply could not win, in the circumstances, would have simply prompted Russia to invade all of Ukraine and trigger a much larger conflict that would have devastated Ukraine and likely resulted in a huge loss of territory. *Active* involvement by the western allies could have triggered what would basically be WWIII, with the entire Middle East also going up in flames, due to the involvement of both Russia and the US in that area.

There were certainly conflicting positions within the American government, with some ardently advocating for a more aggressive response, and Obama made what he thought was the wisest decision *at the time*. In hindsight, it might have been the wrong decision, but there is *no way to know that*.

There were a *lot* of considerations involved in that decision, and it was not as simple, nor as self-serving, as many people try to make it sound.

For digital systems, the ""information signal to noise ratio"" is actually something called Eb/N or ""energy per bit to noise power ratio,"" and that is calculated per unit bandwidth (Eb/N/Hz).  Under normal conditions, the Hz term drops off because receiver noise power is uniform in frequency, but with swept tones, interference noise power is no longer uniform.  So basically, if you have your narrow tone, and you sweep it over the bandwidth of a target signal faster than the time it takes to transmit that bit of energy, you effectively obtain interference noise power equal to 1kW*(sweep bandwidth).  So you have basically created a situation where instead of just power and bandwidth, you've added an element of time, and arguably processing power to the jamming budget.  The faster you can hop/sweep/chirp, the more effective power you have.

 >The Kortik (Russian: Кортик, ""dirk"") close-in weapon system (CIWS) is a modern naval air defence gun-missile system deployed by the Russian Navy. Its export version is known as Kashtan (Russian: Каштан, English: Chestnut), with the NATO designation CADS-N-1 Kashtan. The Kortik is found on the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, Kirov-class battlecruiser, Neustrashimy-class frigate; and the People's Liberation Army Navy Sovremenny-class destroyers, and other modern designs. Typically deployed as a combined gun and missile system, it provides defence against anti-ship missiles, anti-radar missiles and guided bombs.

It must be an interesting decision process what to disclose and what not to disclose. For example, a new longer range rocket system (like whatever that upgraded HIMARS is -some acronym like ATAMCS, I can never remember). Is it better to keep it a secret and then start striking behind enemy lines without warning, or is it better to announce it, which can cause Russia to scramble to pull back to defend that new 'line' without firing a shot first, just because they know Ukraine has the capability? 

It's probably a strategic mix... announce some things that will act as strategic deterrents, keep some things secret for the element of tactical surprise. 

Your example of Finnish heavy mortars is probably a good one. It's not something that needs to be announced but provides an everyday real world advantage in day to day fighting, while the overt announcement of new long range rockets or missiles can strike fear and cause entire battlefield plans to be redrawn, with assets moved/relocated and air defense being shuffled around.

Many of the resolutions put forward by small nations would have effects on the security council. Having a veto on these things keeps the big players in and talking.

Because of this, how the veto works has itself been the subject of many resolutions and behind the scenes agreements. Technically, Security council members would be able to veto anything but they agreed decades ago to limit it's application to prevent the dissolution of the UN as they still held more power within it than out. Provisions limiting or overriding vetos sprang from this charter uncertainty.

The UN works because it forced and continues to force all participants to engage with each other. The complete absence of a veto would remove the incentive for larger power to even engage.",False,1661577389.0,t3_wxywu4,t1_ilyrhdj,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
