Day 236 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet in Kharkiv, there were no missile strikes, and no drones made it to us, though the same can‚Äôt be said about other cities. They did try to send something in the direction of Kharkiv at around 1:30pm, but it was intercepted by our AA, so we don‚Äôt know what it was, but it could have been a Shahed-136, they have used a ton of them today.

With one of their suicide drones they destroyed a very old apartment building in Kyiv, killing at least 4 civilians for absolutely no reason. Some Russian propagandists were saying that they were aiming at an energy company‚Äôs offices, but that doesn‚Äôt make sense either. Why would they target an office when they can try to destroy a substation directly? This is just another deliberate terror attack by Russia, there are no other explanations.

That Su-34 crashing on an apartment building in Russia today just came out of nowhere, it was pretty unexpected. They really can‚Äôt stop targeting civilians, even their own civilians, in their own country. It‚Äôs insane how many of their planes malfunction and crash on their own territory even without our help. 

Some Russians were saying that one of the engines was damaged by a bird, but unless there are some birds that can fly Mach 4-7 I really don‚Äôt think one could have damaged a jet engine that is only accessible from behind the plane. Maybe those are the mutant birds that Russians were so afraid of, the ones that were made in our, definitely real, secret NATO biolabs?",False,1666056335.0,t3_y60vvx,t3_y60vvx,,0,134,0,134,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

The Ukrainian military could only take advantage of the himars‚Äô extended range if its soldiers had intelligence on where to strike. ‚ÄúPrecision fires and intelligence are a marriage,‚Äù the U.S. military official said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to have one without the other.‚Äù The dilemma for the Biden Administration was not whether to give himars to Ukraine, but which munitions to send along with them. Each system can carry either a pod with six rockets, known as gmlrs, with a range of forty miles, or one surface-to-surface missile, or atacms, which can reach a hundred and eighty miles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not himars that carries a risk,‚Äù the Defense Department official said. ‚ÄúBut, rather, if it was equipped with long-range missiles that were used to strike deep in Russian territory.‚Äù

Putin is extremely paranoid about long-range conventional-missile systems. The Kremlin is convinced, for example, that U.S. ballistic-missile defense platforms in Romania and Poland are intended for firing on Russia. Even if Ukraine agreed not to use himars to carry out strikes across the border, the mere technical capability of doing so might prove provocative. ‚ÄúWe had reason to believe the atacms would be a bridge too far,‚Äù the Defense official said.

The battlefield realities inside Ukraine were another determining factor. ‚ÄúThe imperative was ‚ÄòWhat does Ukraine need?‚Äô ‚Äù the Defense official said. ‚ÄúNot what they are asking for‚Äîwhat they need. And we do our own assessment of that.‚Äù The Biden Administration asked for a list of targets that the Ukrainian military wanted to strike with himars. ‚ÄúEvery single grid point was reachable with gmlrs rather than atacms,‚Äù the Defense official said.

There was one exception: Ukraine expressed a more ambitious desire to launch missile strikes on Crimea, which Russia uses for replenishing its forces across the south and which is largely beyond the reach of gmlrs. During the war-game exercises held over the summer, when the possibility of atacms came up, it was clear that Ukraine wanted them to ‚Äúlay waste to Crimea,‚Äù the Defense official said. ‚ÄúPutin sees Crimea as much a part of Russia as St. Petersburg. So, in terms of escalation management, we have to keep that in mind.‚Äù

In multiple conversations, U.S. officials were explicit that the himars could not be used to hit targets across the border. ‚ÄúThe Americans said there is a very serious request that you do not use these weapons to fire on Russian territory,‚Äù the Ukrainian military official said. ‚ÄúWe said right away that‚Äôs absolutely no problem. We‚Äôll use them only against the enemy on the territory of Ukraine.‚Äù As with other weapons platforms, there is no technical mechanism to insure compliance. Officially, the U.S. has signalled that all Ukrainian territory illegally occupied by Russia since 2014‚Äînot only that which it has taken since February‚Äîis fair game for himars strikes. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt said specifically don‚Äôt strike Crimea,‚Äù the Defense official told me. ‚ÄúBut then, we haven‚Äôt enabled them to do so, either.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Each launcher costs roughly seven million dollars. According to some calculations, Ukraine could fire more than five thousand gmlrs missiles per month, whereas their manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, was only producing nine thousand a year. ‚ÄúWe said straightaway, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not going to get very many of these systems,‚Äô ‚Äù the Defense Department official said. ‚Äú ‚ÄòNot because we don‚Äôt trust you but because there simply isn‚Äôt an unlimited quantity of these on planet Earth.‚Äô ‚Äù",False,1666055821.0,t3_y60vvx,t3_y60vvx,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

> ""It‚Äôs very clear that Elon Musk is transmitting a message for Putin. There was a conference in Aspen in late September when Musk offered a version of what was in his tweet ‚Äî including the recognition of Crimea as Russian because it‚Äôs been mostly Russian since the 1780s ‚Äî and the suggestion that the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia should be up for negotiation, because there should be guaranteed water supplies to Crimea. He made this suggestion before Putin‚Äôs annexation of those two territories on September 30. It was a very specific reference. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia essentially control all the water supplies to Crimea. Crimea is a dry peninsula. It has aquifers, but it doesn‚Äôt have rivers. It‚Äôs dependent on water from the Dnipro River that flows through a canal from Kherson. It‚Äôs unlikely Elon Musk knows about this himself. The reference to water is so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin.

> Now, there are several reasons why Musk‚Äôs intervention is interesting and significant. First of all, Putin does this frequently. He uses prominent people as intermediaries to feel out the general political environment, to basically test how people are going to react to ideas. Henry Kissinger, for example, has had interactions with Putin directly and relayed messages. Putin often uses various trusted intermediaries including all kinds of businesspeople. I had intermediaries sent to discuss things with me while I was in government.

> This is a classic Putin play. It‚Äôs just fascinating, of course, that it‚Äôs Elon Musk in this instance, because obviously Elon Musk has a huge Twitter following. He‚Äôs got a longstanding reputation in Russia through Tesla, the SpaceX space programs and also through Starlink. He‚Äôs one of the most popular men in opinion polls in Russia. At the same time, he‚Äôs played a very important part in supporting Ukraine by providing Starlink internet systems to Ukraine, and kept telecommunications going in Ukraine, paid for in part by the U.S. government. Elon Musk has enormous leverage as well as incredible prominence. Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they‚Äôre just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin.""

We already have sanctions against Iran, which were to be relieved as part of the nuclear deal (they would have agreed to not make nukes in exchange for stuff) we had in the works with them, but Trump pulled the US out of that, because of course he did. Now they're facing unrest in their own nation with protests and whatnot for unrelated reasons. 

At the end of the day they lack any useful allies to bolster national security, so of course they turn to Russia after Trump torpedoed the nuclear deal. I'm gonna be straightforward here and say I think this is one of many 'decisions' Trump made that came from Russia. Another is the sudden withdraw from Syria.


I know some people will complain that I'm making this all about US politics or whatever, and I guess I am in this case, but this is why these things matter. We were in a good diplomatic bargaining situation with Iran and Trump just came along and killed it, and now Iran is supporting the Bad Guy. And that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise. 

There's also that whole thing Trump got impeached for - trying to withhold aid money to Ukraine for political dirt. 

As a US citizen, if you want to support Ukraine, vote Democrat. Seriously. Also donate to charities and whatnot, that helps.

Why?  Because Putin's warned that if NATO gave Ukraine weapons that can be fired into Russia, or something like that, it would lead to a nuclear exchange.

NATO interpreted that as ""long range tactical missiles"" because those were something Putin stated was a ""red line"" regarding Russian security concerns in a statement before the annexation of Crimea.

Not to mention the panic it can cause in Europe if the threat gets bigger.

That is an actual risk that Perun discussed in his [latest video](https://youtu.be/xCEzEVwOwS4).

TL;DW: The Ukrainian AA system will only work as long as it has ammunition. If that runs out the Russians can use their jet fighters and attack helicopters, gain air superiority and change the nature of the war.

Western militaries are focussed primarily on shooting down enemy aircraft from the air, while the Soviet military prefered shooting them down from the ground. That means that Ukraine's Western allies have few surface to air missile systems and ammunition for them. There are several surface-based systems that can use air-to-air missiles to shoot down aircraft.

It's an important piece to take over for them to threaten Donestsk oblast. However one big difference here is that Russia lost their northern flank to help the offensive in Donetsk when the Kharkiv front collapsed. This reduced the effectiveness of taking Bakhmut. Even to the point where some pro-Russian commentators (and horrible human beings) like Girkin said Bakhmut was a pointless pursuit.

So it's complicated. It's still important for Russia to take but considering the losses they've had on other fronts it looks a bit misguided. As if the Russian forces are inflexible and won't adapt the developing situation and just want to go ahead with their original plan even as it's quickly losing relevance. 

Some speculation has been that Wagner in Bakhmut is trying to prove that they are the more capable arm of the Russian army because it might give them more political leverage so they are pushing hard to get wins when no other Russian branch is getting any.

I'm not ""concerned"" about it but it is where Russia is very active and losing it wouldn't be good for Ukraine but lets just say I'm more concerned about the Kherson offensive going good.",False,1666032730.0,t3_y60vvx,t1_ispbp2a,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

In theory, Bakhmut falling could result in a bigger part of the frontline being hard to defend / flanked, and i suppose theres a main road going straight to Sloviansk, so any offensive to Sloviansk would take Bakhmut first.

But really, since this offense has been going on for weeks now, there's zero chance of it mattering. By now Ukrainian command has had every chance and then some to decide on how, when, and where to fall back in case Bakhmut does fall. And they've had ages to build defensive lines where needed. Plus, we've already seen Ukraine performing defense in depth at a masterful level. With such a long preperation time there's no reason it should suddenly fail this time.

So if Russia sets its status quo as drone attacks on civilians, hitting them back extra hard would keep them looking for other ways to escalate. Every time new weapons capabilities are authorized for Ukraine, Russia's response is taken into account so as to not push them all the way into using nuclear weapons.

 >Salami slicing tactics, also known as salami slicing, salami tactics, the salami-slice strategy, or salami attacks, is the practice of using a series of many small actions to produce a much larger action or result that would be difficult or unlawful to perform all at once. Politically, the term is used to describe a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition. With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, in piecemeal fashion. Opposition is eliminated ""slice by slice"" until its members realize, usually too late, that it has been virtually neutralized in its entirety.

Arab-Israeli sentiment is more even, 35% support Russia, 41% support Ukraine, meaning that a pretty large majority of Jewish-Israeli sentiment supports Ukraine. 

The reason for Israel refraining (until recently) in support of Russia has far more to do with the fact that Russia has an armed presence right on their border, inside their client state Syria. The Russians were (again, until recently) in a position to make life difficult for Israel in various ways, not least of which preventing Israel from hammering Iranian supplies to Hezbollah. Supplies which could include the same sort of tech Iran has given to Russia.

Balloons were intended to defend against dive bombers flying at heights up to 5,000 feet (1,500 m), forcing them to fly higher and into the range of concentrated anti-aircraft fire: anti-aircraft guns could not traverse fast enough to attack aircraft flying at low altitude and high speed. By the middle of 1940 there were 1,400 balloons, a third of them over the London area.

The design of the kite balloon, having a shape and cable bridling which stabilises the balloon and reduces drag, meant that it could be operated at higher wind speeds than a spherical balloon. Some examples carried small explosive charges that would be pulled up against the aircraft to ensure its destruction.

It was developed in the 1960s, fielded in the 1970s, and has been upgraded several times with the latest electronics. It has been a cornerstone of the air defence of the German Army (Bundeswehr) and a number of other NATO countries. In Germany, the Gepard was phased out in late 2010 and replaced by  Wiesel 2 Ozelot Leichtes Flugabwehrsystem (LeFlaSys)  with four FIM-92 Stinger or LFK NG missile launchers.

Normal anti-drone measures are ineffective. Most effective and cheap solution would be to shut down GPS over the region when attacks are happening, but it would have negative side effects.

GPS jamming will work only if it can be activated for the whole mission duration on the flight path.

Fancy and quite cost effective solution would be to have sticky small drones with noise homing capability. It would attach itself on the body by sticky surface and emit GPS jamming or even altering signal. These Iranian have INS backup, but it is most likely quite coarse in accuracy and used for lapses between signals (for example, encountering a GPS jamming station en route). So loitering 5 minutes at the terminal phase with INS guidance would veer off the course a lot.

In short, the effectiveness relies entirely on the accuracy as the warhead is quite small. If it misses by 10 meters the effect can be neglible.

I'm not sure where you got this from, smaller RCS than the mortar rounds, small drones, or  unguided rockets? Highly doubt that.

Seoul has them on tops of buildings and in places surrounding the city. No reason why Kyiv or Kharkiv would be any different.

>Where are you going to place it? What target are you going to defend? These drones don't really show up on radar

If you're saying that these are problems with CIWS (which I'd argue they are not), then wouldn't the other systems mentioned have the exact same problems, but worse?

Cause like...

-electronic jamming

Where are you going to place it? What target are you going to defend? These drones don't really show up on radar, how is the EW system going to track it?

Also has smaller effective range than the Phalanx 

-shoulder-fired AD (Stingers)

Where are you going to place them? What target are you going to defend? These drones don't really show up on radar, how is the MANPAD going to track it?

FLIR? The Phalanx would still have a much better FLIR system.

Also Stringer has smaller effective range than the Phalanx.

-massed small arms fire

Where are you going to place them? What target are you going to defend? These drones don't really show up on radar, how is person using just their eye sight going to track it?

-Laser weapons (under development)

Where are you going to place it? What target are you going to defend? These drones don't really show up on radar, how is the laser weapon going to track it?

Also the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System is literally a Phalanx CIWS with a laser instead of a Vulcan cannon on it. Exact same radar and FLIR system.",1666032985.0,1666032360.0,t3_y60vvx,t1_ispaezg,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Three models have been produced and used, the first being introduced in 2001.

For a normal crane (as in construction crane), at least the ones I had contact with, it is as you've said. They have a limited amount of rotations in one direction, since the spinny part is connected with cables to the not-spinny part.

For other technical devices there are things like a slip ring (for ref: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip\_ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ring)) which serves as a permanent contact of the spinny and the not-spinny part. You can think of it as two plates in direct contact with one another where one of them can be rotated. This can be used for power supply or data transfer.

 >Mathias Rust (born 1 June 1968) is a German aviator known for his flight that ended with a landing near Red Square in Moscow on 28 May 1987. A teenage amateur pilot, he flew from Helsinki, Finland, to Moscow, being tracked several times by Soviet Air Defence Forces and civilian air traffic controllers, as well as Soviet Air Force interceptor aircraft. The Soviet fighters did not receive permission to shoot him down, and his aeroplane was mistaken for a friendly aircraft several times. He landed on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, next to Red Square near the Kremlin in the capital of the Soviet Union.

They don't necessarily have to use expensive missiles. IGLAs are capable of taking out these drones if correctly positioned, but this is a new threat and adjusting will take time.

Really you need only 1 (one) AA covering a bubble around itself.  Basically, a dirt cheap stripped down alternative to a skyshield, a 10-round burst, and an LRF.  Honestly a bit of decent mechatronics kit.  In addition, every weapon should have a more general-purpose ability for AA or just general hit-anything ability:

\-rifles now have fire control systems and LRFs, it's a software update to add lead computing to hit small drones (M5 may be able to)

\-20mm grenades with airburst/timed shells have been a thing for awhile

\-40mm grenades + a timer, although a bit harder to actually hit, may be effective (very low flight time, but basically dirt-cheap inaccurate flak)

\-there's a general niche for weapons like the 57mm, 40mm, 37mm, etc, as the Syrian civil war proved.  These are often only found in modern armies as IFVs, but something with that kind of punch but manportable is useful, like a return of the crew-served 25mm GL with new impetus

\-artillery and tanks should have the ability to attempt to fire timed airburst at cruise missiles and suicide drones; there's a solid chance of being able to knock them out with modern fire control, even if that chance is low ^(please note: I said ""with modern fire control"", we're not talking ww2 flak barrages.  An unguided M777 CEP at max range is about 50m, at far closer range a computer-controlled cluster of shots would be a decent salvo to knock out a Shahed just by overpressure of the air alone.

They're hard to pick up, harder actually because as ""dumb"" drones without their own radar one of the major advantages of AESA radars doesn't work: they can't operate in passive mode. AESA radar is basically a bunch of computer chips that spit out radar energy, each chip having a transmit and a receive functionality. They're overall a really nice big plate for receiving radar energy though, so they can just act as an antenna in passive mode and listen for enemy radar emissions... but the Iranian drones don't do any of that, so we're left with trying to scan from basically ground level up to max elevation (they have a max altitude of something like 15,000 feet) for something that'll have a RCS of a watermelon, probably blasting at max energy to try to detect these bastards on their way in. Thus the inclusion of IRST (InfraRed Search and Track) - you're not going to detect them from long range, but they are gas powered so they're generating a decent amount of heat. The following is supposition, but as a disposable drone that emphasizes its own cheap construction, they're probably not being kind to the engine, so it's probably red-lining. That'll be a decent amount of heat generated. Granted you're probably only going to see it from a mile or two out (unknown what commercial sensors are going to be able to see, I'm not up to date on those, but from Wikipedia newer generation AIM-9s have operational ranges out to 22 miles, meaning the IR detection capabilities have to be pretty decent at long-ish range) but that's enough time for a flak gun or other kinetic kill gun to get on target if they're already pointing the right general direction... so point the guns generally north-east in Kyiv and hope for the best I guess. A bit of sensor fusion never hurt.

I've been thinking this over this morning... the RCS of these bastards from nose on is small, but from the bottom they're basically one giant flat plane, and that's going to show up really *really* well. The US lost one of its F-117 stealth aircraft essentially the same way - radar caught it from directly underneath where its RCS was actually detectable, and they managed to shoot a missile at it. *WHAT IF* Ukraine set a bunch of cheap radar installations out in the countryside around their cities, pointing essentially straight up? They would only catch the drones when they were essentially on top of the radars, but if the radars are out far enough they'd still be detected before they were at their targets. They're only going *at maximum* about 115mph - that's pretty damned slow, and as cheap dumb drones they're not exactly going to be doing any maneuvering or threat detection (that'd up their cost significantly), so [these guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oerlikon_GDF) slaved to the straight-up radar systems could detect these and destroy them. The difficulty would be that you'd need quite a few of those radar systems, blasting energy basically straight up (more accurately probably in a 120 degree arc) so you'd need one ever 4-5 miles to give yourself adequate coverage, and you'd need a similar number of flak guns, making the *overall* cost of these systems pretty high, though the end result would be quite comprehensive defense... especially if you layered it with some other guns/systems closer in that could fire high energy radar at given altitudes and coordinates when the outer layer signaled incoming contacts - at that point they'd have very accurate tracks to allow precise pointing by the second layer radar systems to get target acquisition in a similar manner that AWACS allows front line fighters to acquire targets...

Ninja Edit: all of this to say that air defense is hard, and made harder when you're trying to be cheap. There are ways to do it - sensor fusion between IR and radar, layered defenses, but it gets expensive quickly when you have to protect large areas and the targets are hard to spot.",1666011825.0,1666011605.0,t3_y60vvx,t1_isnxngu,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Don't underestimate what Musk has done here.  He has undermined confidence in Starlink and SpaceX's ability to supply a key strategic capability.  No way the Ukrainians were going to do anything but stand their ground while Starlink's reliability was in question.  Luckily, the USG stood on Musk's stomach before too much damage could be done.

He claims he's just trying to avoid WW3.  How weird that just after Biden came out and said he would defend Taiwan with the U.S. military, that Musk would advocate for China to annex Taiwan.

There are no U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine, but the U.S. is not going to continue building a relationship with someone as unreliable as Musk.  We are not Russia.  When U.S. troops are in harm's way, they deserve to be relying on systems that are secure, and not in danger of being compromised by the whims of a wannabe Oleg Deripaska.

There is a myriad of things the USG can do to exert pressure on Musk.  They can threaten to charge him under the Espionage Act if he spoke with Putin about anything, even mundane, relating to U.S. support and information systems.  They can threaten a full investigation of ITAR compliance into all of his companies.  With the mere stroke a pen, they could revoke his clearance for any reason at all, and he would be rendered clueless about his own company.

A thermonuclear weapon is by definition the combination a of primary and secondary.  Low yield weapons that lack a secondary are considered fission bombs and are effectively identical in design to a thermonuclear weapon‚Äôs trigger.

> The x-rays do not detonate any secondary.

This is incorrect.  Please see the [radiation implosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_implosion) Wikipedia article.  The primary releases intense X-rays which are captured by the secondary‚Äôs radiation case, a mechanical envelope designed to contain and uniformly direct energy onto the surface of the secondary.  The superheating from X-rays creates ablation and a resulting mechanical impulse which compresses the secondary.  This is analogous to how the high explosives compress the primary, albeit with significantly more energy. 

> So ""fizzling"" a blast gets 1/100 the total yield and about 5% of the area of effect.

This is impossible to know.  A hollow-pit primary that is deprived of neutron sources might fail to achieve a chain reaction, resulting in a yield that is equivalent to the high explosives on the primary.",1666060187.0,1666059516.0,t3_y60vvx,t1_isqtze9,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

I just kind of follow a lot of the Pentagon's tech releases and demonstrations.  I also deployed to Iraq in the Army for a year, and spent another year contracting there.

All I can say to people who aren't in the U.S. military, is there is a reason it's regarded as the best in the world by far.  It's not like the Russian military. Even at my little Army unit, everyone was expected to think outside of the box and solve problems with available resources.  You're encouraged to share your ideas with leaders, even when you're at the lowest level.

It's also not like Russia's military, because we have a huge regular force, and a huge budget.  I've read some reports from Russian conscripts that they were basically given three shots on the range for training, and then deployed. That's not even enough to zero your rifle, let alone train the level of a U.S. infantryman, who has likely shot thousands of rounds in various combat/marksmanship situations by the time they leave basic training.

On top of that, because we have so many full-time warfighters, and such a high budget, we can constantly improve those skills.  We went to the range very often, and we weren't even a line unit.  We attended very technical training all of the time.  Our leaders attend conferences across the country to keep up to date on doctrine, and relay that back to us.

So, when I say people have thought about it, I really mean it.  Those sailors depend on knowing every eventuality and what they would do.  That's how they survive.  They understand that they are a strategic asset, with some of the most highly funded programs.

Be specific. If you are going to claim that I lie you should point out what you think is untrue.

If anything, I believe it's you who fail to be nuanced here, trying to say that Ukraine is just like any western country. Even if disregard Ukraine for a moment, the claim that all western countries are the same is wrong to begin with. 

The fact that you even mention ""both sides"" is an indication that your thoughts lack nuance. There isn't just 2 sides. There's a difference of degree when it comes to extremist problems in all western countries. US has a bigger neo-nazi problem than Norway, and Ukraine has a bigger neo-nazi problem than the US.

US, Norway and Ukraine aren't on the ""same side"". They're on different points on a line.

So a volunteer battlion not founded by the Ukrainian military which only joined it later has it. 

>It wasn't a definition. It was an example.

So what is your definition. Because that's the only real thing you can provide to say that ukraine has a nazi problem so far. 

>They have more than radicals. They literally have neo-nazi militias.

Militias which exist because they are in the process of fighting a war.

If a country arms thousands of people and some of them happened to be nazis, saying that they're ""arming Nazis"" is a bit a disingenuous. 

The US has Neo nazi militias like the base. 

I'm not saying you're lying. I'm saying you're needlessly finding a middle ground between Russian claims and reality. The reality is that ukraine is a nation where the far right party(which is also not explicitly nazi, just obviously possessing sympathy in that direction, in many ways is quite similar to the AfD) got around 2% of the vote, is in decline and has one seat total in parliament, down from 6, iirc. Many far right populist parties in Europe get more votes. Hell, Sweden has a party in power in a coalition which literally is a toned down version of their past selves as a proper Nazi party. 

>There's a difference of degree, and simply saying, ""they have some radicals"" is using language that hides the difference. That is downplaying it.

No it really doesn't. Stating that they have Neo Nazi militias and that differentiates them from other countries is a statement remarkably lacking in nuance. The Azov battlion arose in 2014, as a result of the war. If tomorrow Finland gets invaded and have to fight a hard war, they will no doubt have a similar situation. Does that mean they have a major nazi issue that grew in a month or does that mean that rough times lead to the arming of pretty terrible people as an evil necessity. You are blaming a natural consequence of war as the big differentiating point. As long as there's war there will be this ""nazi problem"". 

The facts are, this isn't really a nazi militia problem as much as it's just a war problem. 


>US, Norway and Ukraine aren't on the ""same side"". They're on different points on a line.

US Norway and Ukraine all 3 are nations with a minor extremism problem politically. One is at active war so some of these extremists are armed.

You were the one who claimed that this was lending justification to Russia.

And i disagree with this. Just look at their voting patterns. People keep ignoring this, but the far right holds as much political sway in Ukraine as it does in any EU country. The only actual difference here is that parts of the far right are armed, since you know, there's a war going on.
