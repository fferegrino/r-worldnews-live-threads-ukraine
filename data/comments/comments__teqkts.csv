bed04a711faa1c2d06a8b265b1df5393,teqkts,i0sdcpe,"New Yorker interview with Professor Stephen Kotkin of Princeton, one of the world's top Russian historians. Highly recommend if you want a deep background on some of the issues at play in this terrible war.

A sample:

**Q**: When you talk about the internal dynamics of Russia, it brings to mind a piece that you wrote for Foreign Affairs, six years ago, which began, “For half a millennium, Russian foreign policy has been characterized by soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country’s capabilities. Beginning with the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the sixteenth century, Russia managed to expand at an average rate of fifty square miles per day for hundreds of years, eventually covering one-sixth of the earth’s landmass.” 

You go on to describe three “fleeting moments” of Russian ascendancy: first during the reign of Peter the Great, then Alexander I’s victory over Napoleon, and then, of course, Stalin’s victory over Hitler. And then you say that, “these high-water marks aside, however, Russia has almost always been a relatively weak great power.” I wonder if you could expand on that and talk about how the internal dynamics of Russia have led to the present moment under Putin.

**A**: We had this debate about Iraq. Was Iraq the way it was because of Saddam, or was Saddam the way he was because of Iraq? In other words, there’s the personality, which can’t be denied, but there are also structural factors that shape the personality. One of the arguments I made in my Stalin book was that being the dictator, being in charge of Russian power in the world in those circumstances and in that time period, made Stalin who he was and not the other way around.Russia is a remarkable civilization: in the arts, music, literature, dance, film. In every sphere, it’s a profound, remarkable place—a whole civilization, more than just a country. 

At the same time, Russia feels that it has a “special place” in the world, a special mission. It’s Eastern Orthodox, not Western. And it wants to stand out as a great power. Its problem has always been not this sense of self or identity but the fact that its capabilities have never matched its aspirations. It’s always in a struggle to live up to these aspirations, but it can’t, because the West has always been more powerful.

Russia is a great power, but not the great power, except for those few moments in history that you just enumerated. In trying to match the West or at least manage the differential between Russia and the West, they resort to coercion. They use a very heavy state-centric approach to try to beat the country forward and upwards in order, militarily and economically, to either match or compete with the West. 

And that works for a time, but very superficially. Russia has a spurt of economic growth, and it builds up its military, and then, of course, it hits a wall. It then has a long period of stagnation where the problem gets worse. The very attempt to solve the problem worsens the problem, and the gulf with the West widens. The West has the technology, the economic growth, and the stronger military.

The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with a personal ruler. Instead of getting the strong state that they want, to manage the gulf with the West and push and force Russia up to the highest level, they instead get a personalist regime. 

They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism. They’ve been in this bind for a while because they cannot relinquish that sense of exceptionalism, that aspiration to be the greatest power, but they cannot match that in reality. Eurasia is just much weaker than the Anglo-American model of power. Iran, Russia, and China, with very similar models, are all trying to catch the West, trying to manage the West and this differential in power.

**In Ukraine**

👉🆕 Ukrainian Parliament approves extension of martial law until April 26

👉🆕 Fox News camera man Pierre Zakrzewski has died in the hospital from his wounds sustained in yesterday's attack on him and his colleague Ben Hall who is still in critical condition

👉🆕 Satellite pictures from this morning show a large Russian naval force that includes eight amphibious landing ships approaching Odessa today. Civilian reports say a large Russian convoy has left the Mykolaiv area heading towards Kherson. The naval force might be a way for Russian forces to pin down Odessa forces from reinforcing Ukrainian troops in Mykolaiv and allowing an Ukrainian push there, as an amphibious assault would be incredibly costly and unlikely to succeed

👉🆕 Two Russian T-80 main battle tanks captured today in Kharkiv Oblast reports Ukrainian journalist Yuri Butosov who is there. They are already being taken into service by the Ukrainian Army

👉🆕 The crew of a Russian tank taken out near Izyum supposedly wore Cadet markings, pictures of their uniforms show

👉🆕 Mariupol Regional Intensive Care Hospital's staff and patients reportedly taken hostage by Russian forces since yesterday morning. Eyewitness reports claim Russian soldiers do not allow anyone to leave, and that they are firing on Ukrainian positions from the hospital windows. Using hospital staff and patients as human shields, if true, is a clear war crime

👉🆕 The train carrying the Polish, Czech and Slovenian PMs passed Lviv at around 3pm local time and is expected to arrive in Kyiv this evening after the curfew has gone into effect

👉🆕 Ukraine Media Center, a public initiative supported by the government, opens in Lviv to help media gather information and cover the war

👉🆕 Security Service of Ukraine reports it has detained 60 collaborators and 20 Russian special operatives in the last two days

👉🆕 Kharkiv has been attacked by artillery shells while emergency services are trying to rescue people trapped by previous strikes

👉🆕 An attempt by Russian forces to breach Ukraine's defensive line along the Irpin river north of Kyiv has reportedly been foiled, claims Armed Forces of Ukraine. This happened in the direction of Huta Mezhyhirska and Lyutizh

👉🆕 Ukraine Army Officials claim almost the entire Ukrainian reserve has been mobilized, almost 200k soldiers, and that the second round of mobilization has begun. They also say Ukrainian forces are going on the counterattack in certain directions

👉🆕 Witnesses claim there's been explosions at Kherson airport

👉🆕 Ukrainian military intelligence claims Russia plans mass logging of Ukraine's forests and that profits from the sold wood would go to the Russian army. This from a supposed letter written by the Russian Defence Minister to President Putin

👉🆕 A Russian command post vehicle, possibly an artillery fire control vehicle, was allegedly destroyed in Kharkiv Oblast

👉🆕 Ukrainian army has reportedly had a successful attack in the Luhansk region, performed by its 24th Mechanized Brigade. Three Russian T-72 tanks and a BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle said to be destroyed

👉🆕 Two civilians abducted by Russian occupiers in Berdyansk during a protest rally today says eyewitnesses

👉🆕 Kyiv grocery stores still very well stocked reports war correspondent in the city

👉🆕 More than 2 000 private vehicles have left Mariupol so far today through the humanitarian corridor with about as many waiting to leave, Ukrainian officials report. Buses are still prevented from leaving, and the humanitarian aid convoy, carrying 100 tons of supplies, is still confirmed as stuck in Russian-occupied Berdyansk after leaving Zaporizhzhia on Saturday, with Russian forces refusing to let it pass

👉🆕 Ukrainian government cancels all business inspections and say individual entrepreneurs only to pay tax voluntarily

👉🆕 Boris Johnson to ask Saudi Arabia to condemn Russian invasion during talks later this week says his spokesman

👉🆕 Finland's President after speaking with Putin says he was told Russia does not intend for a ""regime change"" in Ukraine, a clear reversal from earlier Russian positions, which could indicate that Russian goals for the invasion are changing and an acknowledgement that the war is not going to plan

👉🆕 Pentagon reportedly looking to send counter-drone tech to Ukraine

👉🆕 Belarusian dictator Lukashenko claims today in a state TV broadcast that a ballistic missile was fired against Belarus two days ago from Ukraine but that they intercepted it. He also says Belarus has no intention to get involved in Russia's ""special military operation""

They also say they believe the energy price shock for Europe could be on par with the 1973 oil embargo and similar severe episodes

👉🆕 Captain of Russia's national soccer team declines joining the team gathering in March due to having family in Ukraine. He says in Russian media that it's not a political boycott, just family reasons

> . . . Putin’s war of obliteration comes readily into focus as genocidal, if not—to date, anyway—as comprehensive genocide. His apparent objective is to extinguish Ukraine as an independent nation, and to subsume it and its surviving population into Russia, where he claims it naturally belongs . . . In early February, after President Emmanuel Macron, of France, flew to Moscow to try to reason with him, they held a joint press conference **in which Putin said, as if addressing Ukraine directly, “Like it or not, take it, my beauty.” The line was immediately recognized as a reference to a luridly menacing song about necrophiliac rape by the punk band Red Mold . . . Putin had made himself clear: he viewed Ukraine as a corpse, and would have his way with it.**",1647355594.0,1647355504.0,t3_teqkts,t3_teqkts,,0,64,0,64,0,0,

\---

While I'm here, here's what our refugees have asked us for. I know there are dedicated subs for this, but there's lots of people here.

Here's what you can do for refugees in transit, or seeking to live in your country either permanently, or until it is safe to go back home.

\- electronics. Lots of students escaping, who continue their education via online classes, but can't, because they couldn't take their electronics with them when they ran. They need electronics - decent ones, not some 8 year old, wheezing antique pieces of crap. If you can afford to buy a tablet or a laptop, or have an used one that's still in decent shape (i.e can run video call apps fine, or maybe even shit like Adobe Photoshop etc), call up your local refugee aid centres and let them know that you have some. They'll likely call you back when someone comes in asking if you've got computers.

\- battery banks. Though those are more needed at the border. Batteries in general, but battery banks with charging cords!

\- adults' clothing. Good clothing - light outerwear for spring. Good footwear. Men's clothes. You wouldn't believe the kind of low quality, useless shit we get, and how much of it. Baby clothes too - unless you have excellent quality stuff, hold your horses for now . We filled an entire cinema hall with baby clothes. Good quality adult clothes are needed. Nice fall/spring coats. Women have it easier, but men's clothes are scarce. Donate good quality trousers, footwear, outerwear, not just your crap.

\- entertainment. Clean stuffies for little children, those have proven to be popular as they're just looking for something to hug right now. Shit, I've even seen solo adults get themselves a stuffie. But also donate chess sets. Yesterday we had an incredibly polite teen boy asking if we had a chess set as it's something you can play with someone else.

\- medicines. NSAIDs primarily.

\- personal hygiene products. For women, as well as men, and general stuff. Razors for men: not disposable ones, though if you have those, it's fine. ~~Get those razors with a single blade that you switch out~~ safety razors, as I was informed, as it'll last whoever takes it through transit, and getting blades for it will be cheap. Shampoos, tooth paste, body wash. Shaving foam for men. New make-up or perfumes even, because while it seems stupid, they're luxury goods. When everything is taken from you, you turn to such stupid little things to make you feel groomed, dignified, and human. **But make sure to ask your donation centre before**. And no used products. The goal's to lift spirits.

\- **Important: clean stuff. Good quality stuff. Don't donate your junk, refugee supply centres aren't your personal trash bin.** We have to actually manually sort through this shit. You're not making lives easier for refugees in need of supplies, you're just taking up our time and theirs by sending us crap we have to sort through and dispose of. Call whichever centre you're bringing supplies to, and ask them what they need. We're actually here, getting calls and talking to people. We can tell you what is needed the most every day. Don't just show up with a box of shit, then stomp away angrily when your bag full of broken toys is getting turned away.

**Finally:** volunteers are always needed. Live in Eastern Europe, or any of the countries accepting Ukrainian refugees? if you speak Ukrainian or Russian, go volunteer. Even an hour or two out of your day will do. You can also volunteer if you don't speak Russian or Ukrainian, but it's more difficult, as so far the refugees don't really speak English, so you'll just have to communicate by flailing around. That's the case with me. I don't speak Russian or Ukrainian. Still. Every pair of hands is needed with receiving goods, sorting them, and getting people what they need. You can usually just walk into a centre and ask if they need another volunteer.",False,1647363950.0,t3_teqkts,t3_teqkts,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

ff0f244df89842e34676a1d4fc955311,teqkts,i0rh0sz,"Hi everyone! I just keep seeing some of the same arguments taking place about NATO, WWIII, Nuclear weapons, and more… and some folks just seem to think they are 100% correct on their opinions when there is actually a much more nuanced conversation to be had. I wanted to provide some alternative views to some common views by redditors I keep seeing people bringing up about the current situation.  
  
To be fully transparent, I do support more aggressive actions from NATO to save the Ukrainian people but I am weary for the repercussions of such actions. I think it is a valid discussion to have, and folks who legitimately want to talk about a NFZ or a humanitarian air corridor should not be treated like they are crazy due to some of the discussion points below.  
  
Let’s try to be open to different ideas, and not allow this forum to simply be two extremes yelling at each other…  
  
**View:** “It would be racist of NATO and the West to step in to save Ukrainians when we aren’t doing anything to save Syrians or Uyghurs”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: While the situation in China and Syria is tragic, and the west SHOULD do more to alleviate these atrocities, NATO and the west are in a completely different situation with Ukraine and to compare these crises would be comparing apples to organges.  
  
In both Syria and China, the ‘enemy’ is not an outsider – but the local government. Unfortunately, domestic issues are far more complicated to solve from the outside than an international conflict. The west would not only have to pacify the government forces causing the violence but also occupy the country for years or decades, and commit to nation building as we would have destroyed the system that was in place.  
  
In Ukraine, the ‘enemy’ is a foreign invader and the local government would be the ‘good guys’ in this situation and no government would need to be toppled. Once the invaders are repelled and the border is fortified, a campaign within Ukraine would not need long-term occupation or nation building. I’m not saying it would be easy, just a much less complicated set of objectives than with the situation in Syria and China. It isn’t racist to admit these are vastly different situations.  
  
**View**: “NATO is only a defensive agreement, it would be undermining NATO’s integrity to become more involved”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: White NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.  
  
**View**: “If NATO engages militarily against Russia, it will result in a World War III!""  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: In order for a war to be a global conflict, it needs to span the globe. That would require 1) Russia to be able to, on its own, sustain military engagements against multiple NATO fronts around the world or 2) Russia to have allies willing to step in to defend their War in Ukraine.However, for point 1, Russia has shown that their military is far too weak and undermaintained to even employ a successful campaign against a far inferior power that happens to be their next door neighbor let alone against multiple enemies around the globe. For point 2, even Russia’s closest ally Kazakhstan has indicated their unwillingness to support Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Also, Russia’s other closest ally Belarus had most of their army threaten to mutiny if they were deployed to Ukraine. As it stands, there would be no World War III if Russia and NATO were to engage militarily.  
  
**View**: “Russia will nuke NATO if anyone tries to save Ukraine!”  
  
**Alternative perspective**: Mutually Assured Destruction has allowed for a relative peace between global powers for nearly 80 years because it is an assured suicide to launch a nuclear attack. There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…  
  
**View**: “Putin is insane! MAD no longer applies when Russia is being run by a madman!”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: Putin may be crazy, but he isn’t suicidal, nor are his staff or officers. Russia has been at a disadvantage since the fall of the USSR (and even before…). Coming from a position of weakness, and with the understanding that their conventional military is no match for NATO, Putin has employed a well known geopolitical strategy made famous by our very own Richard Nixon known as the “Madman Theory”. With this strategy, Putin and the Kremlin allow a narrative of an “irrational and volatile” Putin who may just ‘press the button’ if he gets too upset. This allows Russia to engage internationally with MUCH more projected power than they actually have, because the west is paralyzed into thinking that Putin has a death wish and wants to end the world.",False,1647359729.0,t3_teqkts,t3_teqkts,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

> 
> Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, March 15,  that his country no longer had any use for NATO membership, because the Atlantic Alliance does not live, and has not lived up to its word of supporting democracy and freedom. The Ukrainian leader’s criticism, delivered in a daily address to the nation, tacitly ceded to the Russian Federation (RF) one aim of the Kremlin’s ongoing war: that Ukraine never become a NATO member.
> 
> “If the doors to the alliance (NATO) really were open, we wouldn’t have been begging them to close our skies (to RF aircraft) for the last 20 days, so our people stop getting bombed,” Zelensky said.
> 
> “Either they don’t hear us, or they don’t want to hear us,” Zelensky said, adding that “certain nations” within NATO are continuing to veto repeated and urgent Ukrainian requests the alliance commit aircraft to a no-fly zone over Ukraine, to stop RF missile and bombardment of Ukrainian homes and businesses.

> According to most observers, the Kremlin had hoped for a quick and easy victory, but instead got bogged down against a dogged and at times vicious Ukrainian defense. Zelensky said that for Ukraine to agree to any ceasefire or peace agreement, it must have ironclad guarantees to its security and territorial integrity – something NATO is patently incapable of providing.

A little update on Russian progress. It does seem like in the south they are defiantly moving and taking territory. Kyiv it seems they are waiting for something. More supplies or for the south to link up. Either way the progress in the south is concerning even if it's been 20 days. Most forces were probably around Donbass and around Kyiv. The south looks a lot less deserted from Ukrainian perspective.

They may have had that in their plan. The attack from the north and east was the biggest ones to watch. Can't stretch resources too thin and have to give in to some areas.

Hello, I've been a long time lurker of reddit and never braved commenting before on anything so never needed an account, hence the brand new account.

I wanted to ask if anyone is able to find out if the mother of the 18 month year old little boy who died due to their home being shelled in Mariupol, is still alive?

I do not know this lady. But as a mother myself with a little boy the same age my heart went out to her. Ever since she has been in my thoughts everyday. Every night I have light a candle for her and her little boy. In hopes that there is some sort of spiritual thing out there that exists and that the little bit of heat from the candle travels and provides her with a bit of warmth and comfort. I know that's silly, but there is nothing else I am able to do.

I would just like to know if she's still alive. And I hope beyond hope that if she is, she's been able to escape the city.

Her name is Marina, and the little boy, Kirill.

I think that's more or less always going to be the case in any war. If Russia thinks they are winning, or will win, then they are not going to give up on any of their demands. Once Russia thinks they might lose, they will start presenting more favorable propositions.

Right now Russia wants a promise from Ukraine to never join NATO (and maybe the EU too), and it wants Ukraine to agree that Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk are all part of Russia (or independent with extremely close ties to Russia?).

Ukraine seems to be prepping to give in on one of those points (they have been saying recently that hopes of joining NATO are gone), but they will not want to give up that territory. 

If Ukraine feels they are losing the war, they might concede on Crimea. If they feel like they can really win the war, I'd expect them to make none of those concessions and instead demand that Russia completely leave Crimea.

I think peace negotiations will make a breakthrough when one side suffers a devastating setback. Like Kyiv falling, or Russia being significantly pushed back on multiple fronts, and Ukrainian cities being taken back.",False,1647377044.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0sn951,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

It's a major job in the CIA and the primary qualification is foreign language fluency. They hire for these positions openly and it's not clandestine work (source: the CIA literally shows up at university job fairs, at least in DC). Basically, you sit there and sort through whatever kind of material is being published looking for valuable information of any kind. In the past, this was as simple as consuming standard public media (newspapers, tv, radio). Even in countries with limited free press, there could still be a lot to be gained by a clued in observer: that certain language might indicate a regime's shift in policy, for instance.

However as this war is demonstrating, the scope has vastly expanded via the impact of social media. We now have public sources with direct access (ie, any random person with smart phone in warzone) taking images/video and also giving their own opinions/and reporting via twitter, telegram, etc. This output is massive. It both provides huge opportunities for getting first-hand information but also for disinformation as there is no barrier to entry. So the analysis portion becomes a lot more important.

In terms of how legit people are, you sort of have to judge that in the same way you would any online content. Anything linked to an actual public identity (person or organization) you can research their credentials. If it's just a twitter account with a cool name, then it's probably amateur, but the material could still be valid: look throug what they're posting, what the sources are, especially look at dates and other such things that may validate real info from reposts.",False,1647375261.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0sicjg,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

He fled to Russia and within a few days of him stepping down, the Russians began moving in on Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea and their initial invasion. At that point, it would have been tremendously difficult to convince all 30 NATO members to permit Ukrainian admission to NATO.

The primary limiting factor to the Russian advance in Ukraine is supply. Their logistics systems are all (for better or worse) centered around trains for the bulk of logistics movements. The biggest reason for Russia's current stalls are that they've reached the limits of the range from their logistics centers they can protect. At the start of the war Ukraine cut every train connection they had to Russia because of this. Ukraine will likely be able to hold out as long as they connections stay severed. As soon as Russian engineers reconnect Ukraine to their train network we might see things start to get really bad for Ukraine.

edit to add: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FN5wChSXsAM3kNm?format=jpg&name=4096x4096 This is a great image that highlights Russia's supply limitations based on range from current supply depots.

However, and this is a huge point. Ukraine has now had time to assemble their troops, get massive amounts of supplies from the west, and have gotten a large number of volunteers in their foreign legion.

When you get into a war, you don't know what will happen. 

Putin didn't foresee to be stalled in Ukraine after 3 weeks of war.

Those who started WW1 didn't foresee it would last for 4 years, kill millions of people, bring down 3 empires, help bringing communism in Russia and Nazism in Germany, and completely change the map of Europe, among other things.

Those who started WW2 didn't foresee it would last for 6 years, bring about the complete destruction of Germany and other countries, kill (again) millions of people, end whatever dominance Europe had left in the World, etc. 

Etc.

Putin has escalated starting the war in Ukraine, yes. But the answer is not to continue the escalation by making NATO attack Russian army in Ukraine. As much as NATO leaders would be convinced they can defeat Russia quickly in Ukraine, force them to retreat, and that's it, you have no idea how it'll end. And it can end in WW3 and nuclear war.

There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…

I agree with everything except this particular segment. The only reason MAD kept the world safe is that everyone was aware of it and no one ever called out a nuclear power on an ultimatum. There was never a situation where one nuclear power said ""if you step across this line I'll nuke you"" and then another nation stepped across the line and said ""you're never going to do it anyways because MAD"". 

The moment NATO intervenes and ignores Putin's ultimatum, he *has* to nuke or never be taken seriously again.

fb8ff9fb589bde6a8c8e63e68c6dd57d,teqkts,i0s7pug," Despite the grandiose claims on the internet about the petrodollar reality is less exciting than a simple conspiracy theory. 

>[It is true that oil is priced in dollars and that most oil is traded in dollars, but these facts make relatively little difference for the status of the dollar as an international currency or the economic well-being of the United States.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/07/debunking-the-dumping-the-dollar-conspiracy/)

>With the United States’ ascendancy as the pre-eminent economic power after World War II, the dollar became the world’s reserve currency: Most countries held dollars in reserve in the event that they suddenly needed an asset other than their own currency to pay for imports, or to support their own currency. Much international trade, including trade not involving the United States, was carried through in dollars. In addition, most internationally traded commodities became priced in dollars on exchanges. However, the dollar was never universally used to carry through trade (even trade in oil), and the pricing of commodities in dollars is primarily just a convention.

...

>Even if all oil were sold for dollars, it would be a very small factor in the international demand for dollars, as can be seen with a bit of simple arithmetic. World oil production is a bit under 90 million barrels a day. If two-thirds of this oil is sold across national borders, then it implies a daily oil trade of 60 million barrels. If all of this oil is sold in dollars, then it means that oil consumers would have to collectively hold $4.2 billion to cover their daily oil tab.

>By comparison, China alone holds more than $1 trillion in currency reserves, more than 200 times the transaction demand for oil. In other words, if China reduced its holdings of dollars by just 0.5 percent, it would have more impact on the demand for dollars than if all oil exporters suddenly stopped accepting dollars for their oil.

>This raises a more serious issue affecting the demand for dollars, which is the dollar’s status as an international reserve currency. Currently the dollar is by far the preferred currency, but others, notably the euro, are gaining ground. A switch away from the dollar will lower its value, but this is hardly anything to fear: In actuality, it was and is an official policy goal of both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations.

>Both administrations are on record complaining about China’s “manipulation” of its currency. China does this by buying up vast amounts of dollars to hold as foreign reserves, suppressing the value of the yuan against the dollar. This, in turn, makes Chinese goods cheaper in the United States and bolsters China’s exports.

>If China stopped buying up huge amounts of dollars, as the United States wishes, then the dollar would fall in value against the yuan, thereby making Chinese imports more expensive. The result would be that the United States would buy fewer imports from China, improving its trade balance. Not too many people would be frightened by this prospect.

>To summarize, the dollars needed to finance the international oil trade are trivial compared with other sources of demand for dollars. The currency chosen for foreign reserve holdings can have an impact on demand for dollars, but this has nothing to do with the currency chosen to conduct the oil trade. If Saudi Arabia wanted to hold euros rather than dollars, it could almost instantly offload as many dollars as it desired. Plus, the White House wants the dollar to decline anyway because it would improve the United States’ trade balance.",1647370392.0,1647370061.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0s59nk,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Edit: some additional thoughts:

This strikes me as a deliberate leak/propaganda with the intent to try and convince the western public that the Russians are so completely delusional as to genuinely believe that they could get away with deliberate missile attacks against Poland and the Baltics and that the west/NATO will either do nothing at all, or completely collapse within days like a bunch of babies.

The basic idea being that if we believe that *they* genuinely believe this, then we might also believe they're crazy enough to actually *try*. Which of course *would* result in a military response from NATO, which might then unleash WW3 for real. 

And so, perhaps the Russian hope is that western audiences will get concerned enough about this chain of events to put pressure on their governments to lift sanctions.

Of course it doesn't really *work* because A), the west hasn't been this united and firm in a very long time and an actual strike against us would only serve to further that unity, as would the mere threat of it. And B) the Russians have been getting absolutely *humiliated* by the Ukrainians to the point that the the supposed threat that Russia represents appears to the public to have been greatly exagerated.",1647372316.0,1647369712.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0s55on,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

You're talking pretty much all leading-edge semiconductor production and 50%+ of global semiconductor production being taken out. 

The result will be that you basically slash global production of everything that uses electricity anywhere in it by 50%+. I would expect total state control over the limited remaining production capacity for the most critical uses.

It will take probably 10+ years to rebuild that capacity, by which time most firms will have probably spiraled into bankruptcy from a decade of being unable to produce more than intermittent low volumes.

If they were to lose the war 'straight up', the combination of sanctions and war reprimands will make them bankrupt likely. It'll be the nail in the coffin for Russia's economy and we'll likely start seeing a big shift in power within the country. 

If they were to win the Ukraine war, but still lose economically; I think we'll see a stronger reliance on countries not fully supporting the sanctions. Most of their imports native to other European countries and the US will have a tremendous cost associated with it. There will be a big boycott on 'Western' goods, maybe even deemed illegal in some cases (similar to Cuban cigars). 

If Russia were to face a revolt and civilians overthrow the oligarchy (very unlikely); it would splinter into multiple Republics with leftover nuclear weapons between borders. NATO and China/North Korea will be acting fast to put their influences on the regions. It'll be a hot bed of conflict and drama

0f403bda9115cbcbe17242c6a0d80076,teqkts,i0rcvt7,"Nobody can definitively say they know the answer to this. Not Zelensky. Not Putin. Not Biden. Nobody. 

The best-case scenario (I think) would be a Ukrainian victory that brings about regime change in Russia via a palace coup of some sort. I don't think this is particularly likely but certainly not impossible. 10% Odds, let's say. 

The worst-case scenario would be an escalatory spiral that leads, inadvertently, to direct, open conflict between the Russians and NATO. This would at the minimum be a short, major, bloody war and could possibly lead to (absolute worst-case scenario) a nuclear exchange. Again, while not likely at all, it's also not impossible. I put it at 5% odds. 

So what's the most likely outcome? Somewhere between the best and worst-case scenarios. I think this bears an awful lot of historical similarities to the Winter War between the USSR and Finland. After their defeat in WW1 and the Russian Revolution, Finland (like Ukraine after the Cold War) was able to escape the grasp of Russian Imperialism for a few decades before a strengthening USSR demanded territorial and political concessions. Finland refused. Soviets instigated a false flag attack to invade Finland. For the first few months, the war went ***very badly*** for the Soviets as the Finns defended stubbornly. Eventually, The Soviets got their shit together and was able to force the Finns to the negotiating table and gain roughly 10% of their territory, including their second-largest city, and some political concessions. However, they were never able to take Helsinki. 

I think we might see something similar. Ukraine stops the initial advance, Russia gets re-energized after an operational pause and grinds them down (to a degree, not completely) through sheer military quantity over the coming months but it comes at a tremendous political and economic cost.

Ukraine gets forced to the negotiating table. They agree to the Russian annexation of LNR and DNR in their pre-war form/borders and Crimea but do not force a change of government in Ukraine and simply get a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO or the EU ""for now"" (Zelensky is already starting to hint at that.) 

On the world stage, Russia becomes a pariah state and its economy essentially crashes. Putin announces he won't run for re-election in 2024 after being told behind the scenes that he won't and allowed to exit stage left quietly. Russia remains a pariah state and moves towards being a puppet of China whom they are reliant on (think like a relationship similar to North Korea/China) and we enter a period of international relations kind of like a second cold war. 

Ukrainian nationalism goes through the roof. The Ukrainians continue to build up their military greatly with overt and covert western assistance. NATO is strengthened by renewed defense spending by countries like Germany and new members in Sweden, Finland.  

That is my guess. I hope I'm wrong and we get the best case scenario.",1647359274.0,1647358110.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0rac23,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

They have distinct tactical support and fighter groups, each with their defined role and no cross-over capability - their fighters are garbage at attack, essentially.

Normally, the tactic a proper air force would be to attack targets from a distance using precision guided munitions to keep outside of the range of those man-portable units.  The precision munitions (and the proper communications to go with it) means you can put the munitions right where it's needed, while staying safe as they loiter.   That means that the air assets would be vulnerable to larger air defense systems, which is where the 'Wild Weasel' elements would come into play.  

But the Russians can't.   So either they have to drop dumb munitions from safe heights, which means the chances of them hitting what the army needs them to hit are miniscule, or they come down low to drop, which plays right into the hands of the man-portable SAMs.   It's a cluster, any way they go about it.",False,1647370970.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0s7y1p,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Now with international estimates that both sides have about 90% of forces effectiveness remaining (with Russia being all in on the forces they had raged) I am reevaluating that.

When both sides lose at the same rate the defender will have a morale advantage. Fighting to defend ones home they might fight to the last ten or twenty percent of effectiveness. The invader will almost certainly give up before reaching 80% attrition. There is a number where attacker caves and a number where defender caves and the defender will usually take more loses than an attacker before reaching that number.

If Ukraine keeps punching above their weight, big if, they might fend off the active invasion without having to even go to a guerilla combat phase. So far they are damaging a percent of effectiveness per percent of effectiveness they lose. They're also doing an amazing job of taking out forces that are considered superior among the Russian troops like VDV and Spetzna, as well as commanders.

This isn't won yet but it looks like the results so far have been outcome wheres one side loses in the sense of making mistakes, rather than someone winning by strategic genius. They fight until the opponent screws up badly and they gain advantage.

So far Russia has been consistently screwing up, that is changing. On the other hand Ukraine is also receiving support and getting it into the field now. It may turn into a conflict where one side gains advantage and is able to start a push that can take setbackswithout faltering.

Not surprising. One of Putin's chip on shoulder grudges is how ""disrespected"" he feels by the West. Let's be blunt: I am not casting blame onto the West. Almost all the blame for this war lies at Putin's feet. However, some criticism of our diplomatic behavior is deserved. 

We aren't winning as many hearts and minds as we could be. The West's Great Powers are many things, but are our leaders truly empathetic solicitous actors who behave as respectfully as possible to former adversaries or smaller powers? No. 

We've gone out of our way to play tit for tat with Russia for god's sake, doing little things like demanding Putin meet our guy on Airforce 1 at the airport. We've constantly reminded them of their decline and lesser power status. 


Ukraine deserved better treatment, but when we don't even treat potential adversaries with wary respect, it's quite possible that this demonstrates a workplace culture that prioritizes Western great power goals, not the feelings of foreign actors, especially not weaker nations such as Ukraine.


What am I advocating? Idk. A little less hubris is about it. Our core beliefs in democracy and human rights are fine. Our current support for Ukraine is quite useful.

Russians original hope for the conflict was to dab on their military (they did) and the Ukranians to surrender or come to the table instantly because of how much of their military infrastructure was just blown to pieces in that short a time. 

They didn't do either, to the surprise of probably quite literally everybody.

If i was a guessing man, the top brass probably wanted to wait after that didn't work and to properly arm the entire frontline. (seemingly only the front near Crimea region was properly armed) but because of bad communications (a common report, and probably the reason why all those humanitarian corridors got shelled) they ended up partially going in. and then the rest spiraled from there.

41173a5ffe4b7dcd410272e4c8f95afc,teqkts,i0s0c9t,"Omaha beach (aka: Saving Private Ryan) was a disaster.

1. Clouds were covering Omaha beach, so the bombers dropped their bombs completely blind. Needless to say, they completely missed. So there was effectively no air support.

2. Most of the beaches had low-levels of defense, because US/UK spies leaked the wrong location of the landing. So most of the Nazi forces were defending the wrong location. Omaha beach however, the Nazis were holding a training drill on D-Day (just dumb luck), so they were all ready to move into defensive positions when the American troops were spotted.

3. As such, Omaha beach had not only fortified and ready defenders, they had enough time to call in tank-reinforcements to defend against the beach invaders. The other beaches did call in for reinforcements, but paratroopers were in position to ambush the tanks before they reached the beach (so the UK / Canadian forces had an easier time).

4. The first wave of American troops were massacred on the beach. Not only was this grossly demoralizing, but that meant that the 2nd wave and 3rd wave of troops had to climb over the dead bodies before they reached the shelf-wall and could adequately start the attack against the Nazis.

5. Other beaches were defended by mercenaries instead of Nazis. A lot of them just surrendered without resistance.

6. IIRC, the rough waves on Omaha beach (dumb luck / weather) caused all the tanks to fall off their rafts before they got to the beach. So Omaha was _planning_ on having tank support, but very very few tanks even made it to the beach. 27 of the 29 tanks of the 1st wave didn't even make it to the shoreline.

---------------

Just all the bad luck on Omaha beach. It was an aberration. Once the Navy noticed that Omaha beach was having issues, the Navy repositioned its ships and provided covering fire / cannon fire to support. But that didn't help the 1st wave at all, it was just too late for the 1st wave troops to be helped.",1647367581.0,1647367196.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0rwvlf,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

A Russian military contingent is currently stationed in the area, posing a potential threat to both Moldova and Ukraine.
> 
> There is a possibility of involvement in Russian aggression on our territory of military and other entities from Transnistria, including military formations, to maintain offensive potential and to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. These include intelligence and sabotage capabilities, armed formations, and logistical assistance, including ammunition and supplies. The use of Tiraspol airfield for this purpose is also possible.

> According to the Constitution, Moldova is a neutral state, on the territory of which the deployment of foreign troops is prohibited.
> 
> Thus, the Russian Federation, by retaining its contingent in the occupied part of Moldova (in the so-called Transnistrian region), violates Moldova's sovereignty, poses a real threat to security and destabilizes the situation in the region.

- Ukraine recognizing DPR/LPR as independent, (since they don't want to be apart of Ukraine anyway, they want independence.)
- Ukraine giving up on NATO (Zelenskyy said as much today)
- Crimea remains Russian (since it was annexed)

- Russia gives up on regime change
- Russia withdraws
- Russia pays reparations for damages

The issue here is, of course Ukraine doesn't want to recognize DPR/LPR, but the MAJOR issues come from the Russian side.

Putin wants Ukraine to demilitarize, give up Crimea, Recognize DPR and LPR, give up NATO, give up on EU and declare total neutrality. In return, Russia MIGHT withdraw.

I disagree.  Making loud noises about NATO opens two visible paths for him and Ukraine. 1) A (highly unlikely) path where NATO engages directly  2) A path where NATO itself stays out of it but he looks like he did everything he could and where ""compromising"" on joining NATO becomes a negotiable point with Russia.

A less visible path is that NATO members get goaded into providing other assistance out of a sense of guilt. 

--

At this point I expect that if there's a Ukraine/Russian agreement it will involve Ukraine committing to staying out of NATO. (With Zelenskyy selling that decision using his own unheeded calls for NATO assistance)  That's basically the only thing that will let Putin save some face on this, since he'll sell it as a win and proof of his position.

... of course we'd likely also find out that Ukraine will move forward with EU membership. At which point the NATO question is moot.  Given the EU also has a collective defense clause. Such a scenario would likely result in Ukraine having indirect NATO protection in the future, while giving Ukraine time to go through the membership process properly (at some point in the future). Ukraine will also have time to build up further integration with NATO/EU, kind of like Finland.

Manafort then went on to run Trump's Campaign ""free of charge"", other than conspiring with and working with a bunch of known Russian Oligarchs and Intelligence Agents that he ended up having to serve time for....             
  ""But that’s not how U.S. diplomats saw it at the time. A U.S. embassy cable sent from Kiev to Washington in 2006 described Manafort’s job as giving an “extreme makeover” to a presidential hopeful named Viktor Yanukovych, who had the backing of the Kremlin and most of Ukraine’s wealthiest tycoons. His Party of Regions, the cable said, was “a haven” for “mobsters and oligarchs.”


Making things harder for Manafort were the candidate’s rough manners and criminal past, which had dimmed his chances of winning elections. Oafish and inarticulate, Yanukovych had served jail time in his youth for theft and battery. He also had a hard time speaking Ukrainian – the national language – as he had grown up in the Russian-speaking province of Donetsk. Yet Manafort accepted the challenge of trying to make Yanukovych electable. The man paying the exorbitant bills for these efforts was an early backer of the Party of Regions, the coal and metals magnate Rinat Akhmetov, who soon began calling Manafort his friend.   Such relationships were nothing new to the American political consultant, who on Monday pleaded not guilty to charges of tax fraud and money laundering brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The indictment was among the first brought down as part of Mueller’s investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Though the charges were not tied directly to Manafort’s work as the chairman of that campaign in the summer of 2016, they showed that his work as a political gun for hire is very much in the spotlight.""

And then 10 years later, he led the effort to push the WMD lies to justify an invasion. 

And what he predicted would happen was exactly what happened.

Which says to me: this was 100% the actual goal of the Iraq invasion (since we know that even Bush admin officials did not believe in the WMD lies they were spouting, and they didn't believe Iraq had anything to do with 9/11 either).

Should Bush/Cheney be tried for war crimes. Absolutely.

Are the two invasions comparable? (Ukraine and Iraq) - no.  Totally fucking completely different.  US Troops made some shitty mistakes prosecuting that invasion (thanks to Donald Rumsfeld), including torturing detainees, enabling ethnic genocide, and failing to secure territory behind the invasion (look up Al Qaa Qa; Rumsfeld essentially assured that insurgents would have plenty of materials to make IEDs to murder American troops for 2 decades after the invasion).

But American Troops were VERY well equipped, very very well trained, and very well supplied and supported, and showed massive restraint, and commitment to protecting civilians and civil infrastructure. 

This Russian invasion shitshow is none of those things, and their deliberate targeting of civilians amounts to genocide.

It was a balancing act, they wanted to wait long enough to shore up their position and allow the west to be as disarrayed as possible while also not too long that Ukrainians are able to build up their defenses enough to stand on their own(the Turkish drones are a factor here).  Overall, Russia appears to have messed up all 3.  And do you think a dinner with Putin would convince Putin to stop committing war crimes?

1) the pandemic. Do you really think Putin wouldn't have escalated sooner if if weren't for the pandemic?

2) Trump ""stop the steal"" is one big obvious play that shows everything was geared towards a second term and this (biden being elected) was not part of ""ze plan""

3) Its incredibly silly to think that everything hinged on Trump, like Putin was some weak man who just needed some headpats from Trump and he'd stop his lifelong ambition to erase Ukraine and turn it into 'little Russia"" Would you like some quotes on that btw from Russias own state media? 

4) You are denying the very fact that literally EVERYTHING Trump did and EVERYONE who WENT TO JAIL FOR TRUMP was connected to Russia and for Russias benefit, to the point where Trump literally was milimeters away from overturning our election via mike pense.

Along with thousands of stingers, panzerfausts-3, helmets, body armor, medicine, food, ammunition, they even sent the old eastern german army's STRELA anti-air missiles after Ukraine specifically requested them even after Germany told them that 700 out of the 2700 rockets were irreparably damaged.

Those STRELAS are what Ukraine is using to support their newer AA systems. They use the STRELAS to saturate the air around russian fighter jets, baiting the pilots into wasting their flares and revealing their position before the more advanced systems are brought to bear to finish the job.

How the FUCK does Germany look like an asshole similar to Hungary after not only doing all of the above, but also voluntarily gutting itself when it eventually supported Russia getting cut out of SWIFT?

Ukraine knows if it were a NATO member none of this would have happened.

Which is why they tried to join NATO. In 2008.

This freaked out Putin which is why he constantly stirred shit in Ukraines borders so it wouldn’t be eligible to join NATO.

He had a puppet that withdrew Ukraine’s application to join NATO. 

That guy got overthrown for being Putin’s puppet.

But in that process a conflict was started in Crimea which made Ukraine ineligible to join NATO as applicant states cannot be in active conflict. So so long as Putin kept financing and aiding the conflict in Crimea, Ukraine would be ineligible to even apply for NATO.

 >The arms race between Great Britain and Germany that occurred from the last decade of the nineteenth century until the advent of World War I in 1914 was one of the intertwined causes of that conflict. While based in a bilateral relationship that had worsened over many decades, the arms race began with a plan by German Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz in 1897 to create a fleet in being to force Britain to make diplomatic concessions; Tirpitz did not expect the Imperial German Navy to defeat the Royal Navy. With the support of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Tirpitz began passing a series of laws to construct an increasing number of large surface warships.

A large Russian military convoy, widely tracked by satellite imagery, appears to be stalled on its route to Kyiv.

“We still hold that it’s stalled and they have not made any significant progress in unsticking it,” a senior U.S. Defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on a call with reporters on Monday.

The Russian convoy appears to have made little progress for days, according to U.S. assessments. Last week, the official told reporters that “the convoy is not really going anywhere,” when asked about the latest satellite imagery provided by Maxar Technologies.

It is not immediately clear how many vehicles are in the Russian convoy.

 >The Curse of the Colonel (Japanese: カーネルサンダースの呪い, romanisation: Kāneru Sandāsu no Noroi) refers to a 1985 Japanese urban legend regarding a reputed curse placed on the Japanese Kansai-based Hanshin Tigers baseball team by the ghost of deceased KFC founder and mascot Colonel Sanders. The curse was said to be placed on the team because of the Colonel's anger over treatment of one of his store-front statues, which was thrown into the Dōtonbori River by celebrating Hanshin fans before their team's victory in the 1985 Japan Championship Series.

SAM sites in Ukraine means boots on the ground in Ukraine, which is politically expensive and risky for NATO members. First, that's a very inefficient way to set up a no fly zone, because ground based NFZ means lots of sites have to be established in Ukraine-held areas... limiting their effectiveness in the combat zones. (And that's before you consider Earth's curvature.) Those exposed sites also opens them up to Russian artillery & SRBMs attacking them - which, as we've seen, are striking western Ukraine. ""Shoot down the SRBMs"" you say? OK, so that's a lot more than SAMs that we're sending - that means Iron Dome too. And that assumes any Iron Dome can burn through the [probable radar jammers their SRBMs & Cruise Missiles are using.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/us/russia-ukraine-weapons-decoy.html) It probably can, but let's say we find out it can't do it until next week, which means we spend a week reprogramming them, which isn't helpful this second. And let's say we put SAMs on the ground, and they get blown up & somebody dies... well, that's a waste of material *and* there's political fallout for NATO troops dying in Ukraine.

Sanders ran his early chicken biz out of a Shell gas station in the 50s. He put up a billboard ad for the station, but a rival gas station owner kept painting over the sign. Eventually, Sanders got fed up with this and threatened to “blow [his] goddamn head off” if he didn’t stop.

One day, Sanders noticed the rival gas station owner out there AGAIN painting over his sign. He’d had enough — he had one of his employees grab a rifle and they marched off to end this thing for good.

When the rival gas station owner noticed them approaching with a rifle, he went for his own gun and opened fire on the two men, killing Sanders’ employee. Sanders grabbed the dead man’s rifle and returned fire, critically wounding the rival gas station owner, who was ultimately jailed for murder.

This is just one crazy event in Sanders’ life. Well before running his gas station/chicken stop, for example, he was briefly a lawyer — but he was disbarred after getting into a fistfight with his own client during court.

""In the original email posted on WikiLeaks (which has not been verified), Blumenthal emailed Podesta a magazine piece Eichenwald wrote about the politicization of the attack in Benghazi. Sputnik plucked out one paragraph in which Eichenwald acknowledged there were some legitimate reasons to criticize Clinton over Benghazi and presented it as Blumenthal’s words.

Apparently Sputnik realized the error, because the article was quickly taken down. Yet somehow, after only a short time on the internet, Trump was reading the exceptionally false Russian propaganda to an American audience. Eichenwald suggests that this is evidence of a direct link between Trump and Putin:

This is not funny. It is terrifying. The Russians engage in a sloppy disinformation effort and, before the day is out, the Republican nominee for president is standing on a stage reciting the manufactured story as truth. How did this happen? Who in the Trump campaign was feeding him falsehoods straight from the Kremlin? (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment).""

Yes it would be horrible if people from NATO countries died defending Ukraine but that's all it would be, soldiers die all the time for far worse reasons and thousands of civilians dying and a country being taken over by a dictatorial world power that will only grow more bold and aggressive if allowed to get away with this yet again - maybe that's worse. 
  
I certainly don't buy your argument that we shouldn't deploy advanced weapons just in case they don't work, there's no reason to assume they won't and if they don't then finding that out and fixing it is incredibly important - those penetration aids for example should be relatively easy for a system like Patriot to filter out because it's designed to do exactly that, identify and categorise targets for rapid response - and they've of course been collecting plenty of data from Ukraine already so they will have had enough time to train the system. (and it's not like Patriot is secret, it's been deployed all over the world so every major power has all the data they need on it)

That many millennials fell for the propaganda of ‘wait for the world to change’ well into our adulthoods is symptomatic of failures in the educational system.

The focus is instead on the absorption of data and memorization. So when people see something on social media or on the news they’re quick to accept it and less likely to ask themselves questions like, what is the source? Who stands to gain from this? Is this using emotionally charged language aimed at someone of my demographic in order to elicit an emotional response?

 >Colonel Harland David Sanders (September 9, 1890 – December 16, 1980) was an American businessman, best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (also known as KFC) and later acting as the company's brand ambassador and symbol. His name and image are still symbols of the company. The title ""colonel"" is an honorific title, the highest awarded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Kentucky Colonel, and is not a military rank. The Governor of Kentucky bestows the honor of a colonel's commission, by issuance of letters patent.

So you just... didn't pay any attention at all to what happened on January 6th? Or did you already flush it from your memory? 

Either way: let me catch you up... [147 Republican Congressmen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html) did exactly what you are saying they can't do. 

And you are a little off on your understanding, if they anull enough electoral votes, yes it is decided by the state delegations... but those delegations aren't made up of ""state delegates,"" they are made up of the congressman from that state. Let's use Alabama as an example... Alabama has 9 members of its congressional delegation (7 reps, 2 senators) 8 are Republicans. If at least 5 of them vote for Trump... Alabama's vote goes for Trump. 

Care to guess how many delegations the Republicans control?

We don’t even have to go far for a comparison here: Just take a look at what the USSR was doing in this time.

The USSR by the late 1960s had basically settled down in their position as the second most powerful state in the world. And didn’t have that revolutionary fervor going for them anymore. This translated to a massive relaxation around their military not in terms of modernization but it’s public image.

Soviets were also plagued by this problem of vertical stroke: Where if anything went wrong, the senior most officers were blamed for it and suffered repercussions for it. This was in contrast to American Military Justice which was better at appropriating responsibility where it lay. This allowed American military commanders to have the flexibility to try new things while the Soviets were paralyzed with fear of being held accountable for anything going wrong and more interested in projecting an image of everything is fine.

Soviet naval exercises had ships told in advance which ones would be targeted and sunk (and even when and where) and thus took barely any evasive maneuvers during exercises.

Operation Dnieper and other major Soviet military exercises were carefully choreographed affairs for PR and for the politburo’s consumption. Not entirely maybe, but definitely not as honest as the American ones. Andrew Cockburn’s book, The Threat, has accounts of these exercises. A tank operator Sasha describes how their armored formations trained for an “exercise” where they practiced where everyone would move, who would kill who and who would be killed by who and when and where. They had explicit scripts like “OK at this point, an enemy tank will kill you from here”.

But on the day of the exercise, a major snow storm occurred. Since the exercise was conducted with radio silence, no one could figure out what was going on. Sasha had carefully memorized landmarks to remember where he was supposed to go but couldn’t see them in the blizzard. He could make out tank shapes but not enough to know if this was a tank he was supposed to kill or be killed by. All of the fuel trucks got lost.

A lot of officers had their careers curtailed from that incident. And just goes to show how different the American way of exercises is compared to other countries.

The Americans will basically treat all of your units that you or they have on paper as actual units that are 100% fully equipped and combat ready.

At one point in time, the WP had 175 divisions on paper against America’s 16 which is hilarious because the WP only has twice as much manpower. It turns out that literally half of them were paper units with little equipment and fewer men. WP had 3 categories of divisions: Category 1 was fully equipped and only 54 of the 175 were Cat 1 divisions. Category 2 might have most or 2/3rds of their equipment while Cat 3 had almost no equipment and was just a small nucleus of officers.

Warsaw Pact forces for example had a lot of paper units and worse, their units were smaller in size compared to the Americans. An American armored division would have 17,000 men in it, a WP armored division at 11,000.

WP divisions also had less endurance in combat. West German and American divisions could sustain losses in combat and simply be re-inforced and kept in the fight. Warsaw Pact divisions were smaller with fewer capacity for absorbing losses and the Soviet doctrine was to simply withdraw them from combat once losses were significant.

There was also an immense regional gap between the divisions. The best quality Soviet divisions were East German which had good equipment that was well maintained and combat ready. But others like Romania had completely decimated combat readiness and corruption was rife with fuel and supplies sold on the black market, alcoholism and so on.

The Soviets were also notorious for making wooden aircraft and tanks to trick American spy satellites in inflating their strength and so on.

But as far as the Americans were concerned, they considered all of these divisions at full combat strength and ready to roll.

As far as they are concerned, they prepare to fight a full strength enemy and are pleasantly surprised when in actual combat the enemy puts up less of a fight than expected.

So there you have it, that’s my long winded and meandering take on why the US military loses so many of it’s exercises: Over estimate the enemy and be honest about your short comings.

It’s the hallmark of a professional military that they have the intellectual capacity and honesty to field large scale exercises where the point is to actually learn something and identify your short comings than just something that looks nice for the newspapers.

The Chinese have been overhauling major components of their military exercises to incorporate aspects of the American Red vs Blue style. Their Airforce in particular has incorporated several of the American Air Combat exercise methodologies and can almost be considered at par with their American peers when it comes to teaching junior officers to be flexible and adaptable in combat situations while teaching senior officers how to try different iterations of their combat doctrine until they come to one where they actually win in their own scenarios.

Other militaries like Pakistan in the 90s had the same problem as the soviets with choreographed exercises that lacked depth, were mundane training exercises rather than genuine experimentation and lacked imagination and flexibility. It was only after the first few disastrous battles in the War on Terror during the Musharraf era of the mid 2000s that sparked an interest in the Army to try reform their training and exercise patterns.

The Airforce was integrated better into the Army’s operations (similar to what the Americans did in the cold war as mentioned above), officers with combat experience were rotated among formations to pass on their experience and a new host of exercises were conducted which tried out new tactics and strategies that would incorporate not just lessons learned from the operations in the North West but also new ideas that could be employed to deal with the changing South Asian military landscape with a growing conventional imbalance and increasing interest in tactical nuclear weapons.

I recall reading about how foreign pilots taking part in American air combat exercises would come away pleased as punch about how they had kicked American pilot asses during these exercises. Hilariously enough, the Americans themselves encouraged them and were like “Great Job buddy!”. Not realizing that the Americans don’t even bring their full arsenal and tech capability to bear in these exercises as they are trade secrets.

So yea, don’t get too excited about yet another report about Americans losing their own military simulation. That’s literally what they are for. Funny how a military that keeps losing it’s own exercises performed pretty well in Gulf War 1. What we should focus on more is copying the way Americans train their junior officers to adapt and be flexible to fluid combat conditions. Teach their senior officers to try out new stuff in exercises without fear of repercussions. And above all, have the intellectual honesty and capability to keep these exercises realistic and an actual evaluation of what their strengths are what their weaknesses are so that one goes into combat fully prepared for the worst but pleasantly surprised when it doesn’t come to pass.",False,1647371291.0,t3_teqkts,t1_i0s845s,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
