Day 3 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.


Yesterday the fighting in my vicinity was intense,  just a couple of kilometers away our forces destroyed Russian tanks around 6 pm, after that everything was quiet for 12 hours, next shelling started at 6 am, and after that there was some peace again. 


Then around noon there was another massive shelling that continued for many hours one of the shells flew right into the residential street and instantly killed at least 2 people, someone even caught the moment of impact on video, it also broke the windows in the apartment buildings.


Even right now there is constant shelling going on, my building is shaking almost non-stop. People I’m in touch with are saying we are being bombed by Grads, people are very scared, and some are sitting in the shelters, I’m sitting at home right now, but in case of emergency there’s a shelter less than a minute away from me.


Now I’ll talk about the general situation. The curfew was moved from 10 pm to 6 pm, streets are completely dark for the past 2 days, as street illumination is turned off. The worst thing right now is supply issues, the stores are almost completely empty, shelves are empty, drinkable water basically ran out, it’s almost impossible to buy, cashiers are saying that they have at most 2 days’ worth of supplies and after that there will be nothing left, as no new stock is being supplied.


The only things that are still on the shelves are mostly “luxury” things, such as expensive cakes and caviar. Toilet paper is gone, water is gone, and food is mostly gone and will run out in a couple of days at most. And just so everyone understands, tap water is NOT drinkable here, well, you won’t die from drinking it but it will be bad for your health, as water is chemically disinfected with bleach.


All of this happening is just so absurd, I don’t even see the end of this war as there’s simply no end goal, and it’s a war for the sake of war. Nobody here asked to be “liberated” why the fuck do they care more about our government than we do ourselves. No joke our friends from Russia are continuing to say that we should just wait a little more so we can be “cleansed” from nazis, fucking cleansed, at this point they sound more like nazi than nazis themselves.


If they think that people here are fighting for our government then they are dead wrong, people are defending their homes from invaders, who call themselves “liberators”, they think if they kill Zelensky the war would stop, but it will have the opposite effect - it would only make resistance stronger, nobody here is fighting for people in power they are fighting for their own and their families lives.


Do they really think if they put a puppet government here it won’t be overthrown in a matter of weeks? Here, where there were constant revolutions? What the fuck are they smoking? Well, I can guess, sometimes I watch their news, and honestly after watching it I want to throw up, there’s not a single truth in their words, and apparently people are buying into what is being said on the news, but there’s literally no discussion in their news, they don’t even have any arguments for this invasion other than the “nazis”. If anyone is interested in seeing it for themselves you can checkout Россия 24 on YouTube, but I’m not sure if there’s english subtitles so you might not understand anything if you don’t know russian.

Upd. Thanks for everyone's support and the tip about purifying the water, I will look into it.

One of the more surprising encounters I had in the outskirts of Kyiv today was with 50-year-old Alexander, who was manning a makeshift barricade at the entrance to one village with a group of other locals, brandishing whatever weapons they had.

Alexander was born and grew up in Russia, then moved to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, but left when Russian-backed forces took over in 2014. Now, he was ready to fight his own former countrymen.

If he were to capture any Russian soldiers, he said, he would have nothing to say to them, except to scream “Get out, occupier!” He said logic did not work on Russians because of the propaganda narrative dominant there.

He has stopped talking to his relatives in Russia, he said, as they simply don’t understand why he has become a Ukrainian patriot.

“I spoke to my own cousin two days ago and he doesn’t understand anything. That will be our last conversation. I asked him why are you so cowardly, your country is attacking us with ballistic missiles, your own father is from Ukraine, have you gone insane?”

He was, however, realistic about his makeshift team’s chances.

Ukraine has gotta be pushed further to the west and away from Putin, making any Pro Putin puppet regime difficult to sustain. Militarily it looks impossible for him to occupy the entire country to sustain such a regime (this is not like Czechoslovakia or Hungary in the 50s/60s).

Putin hasn't been able to cut supplies from getting to Ukraine, and now Western backing of Ukraine is increasing.

The west is highly united and is clamping down on Russia financially pretty substantially.

Urban warfare tips from a former Marine. I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can’t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.

For the defenders of Kiev, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :

1.) Stay out of the steet.

2.) Stay out of street.

3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.

4.) Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.

5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible.

6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders.

7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.

8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last.

9.) Don’t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.

10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it’s much more handy than a rifle.

11.) Never fire from the same window twice.

12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don’t expose it.

13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.

14.) If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you.

15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.

16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.

17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.

18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.

19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.

20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.

21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.

22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.

I don’t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.

Glory to Ukraine.

Edit: A few extras.

23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.

24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.

25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.

26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.

27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.

28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.

29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. 30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long",False,1645903094.0,t3_t23qm5,t3_t23qm5,,0,186,0,186,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

When I look at this what I see, really clearly, is a boy who wants his mom. But if that boy had managed to do whatever he was in Ukraine to do, instead of being intercepted, the end goal was dead Ukrainians. And maybe he actively signed up for that until he was in over his head, or maybe he's a conscript who's barely out of high school, or maybe both. 

For the kids who fall into either of those categories I'm really hoping we see lots and lots of them surrendering as POWs. Don't know if that's realistic.

[Sanctions miss the richest of the rich](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-sanctions-russian-oligarchs-miss-richest-rich-83118491)

I implore everyone to take a moment and contact your government representatives. Demand they seize the assets Putin and his oligarchs have hidden around the world. They buy up the real-estate, drive up prices and its all to better conceal their blood money.

The **least** we can do, in honor of all those Ukraines who are serving so valiantly, is to pester our representatives until they take action and **seize the assets of Putin and his oligarchs.**

Considered so deadly that for the last two days, the Russians have been trying (and failing) to find and destroy them.

Do these vehicles use a similar type of fuel as civilian vehicles, or more specialized (I've heard about Russians trying to get fuel at gas stations or from locals)? Could civilians technically load up the abandoned vehicles with their own fuel and drive off? Do you need a lot of know-how to operate these vehicles on the most basic level, to drive it away? Do they require keys or some other way to unlock (I have seen one image of an abandoned military vehicle which still had its key inside)?

Edit: Thanks for all the answers, that was interesting and informative. To clarify, I did not want to insinuate that Ukrainians should take Russian armored vehicles on a joyride.

Only now are we seeing the big guns and more modern equipment head in. Not to mention there are reserves should they choose to escalate further.

- Giuliani revently gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius.""

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack domestic opposition's data.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands) 

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO...

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

WRITE TO REDDIT TO REQUEST R/RUSSIA BE TAKEN DOWN!

Use their [request system](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to report the subreddit based on hate speech.

Here's a template I wrote (remember to replace the posts with more current ones if they have changed):  
""Hello,  
If you currently visit the subreddit r/russia, you will see that it currently contains the following posts, among *many others*, on its front page:  
-https://old.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t2396p/ -> ""Do you think Russia is justified with its concerns about NATO imperialism in Europe and the rest of the world especially after NATO's war crimes across the world and ditching the responsibility of solving the immigration crisis created by them ?""  
-https://old.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t21fe6/ -> ""China: ""Was it 'invasion' or some other word?' - Chinese FM spox on the use of semantics""  
-https://old.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t23yox/->  ""The moment when this Ukrainian driver realizes their news are total BS and Russia is in control of the airport""

Each and everyone of those posts is not only entirely factually false, it is based on the very basic wrong narrative that the war in Ukraine is justified, and that the Russians are undoubtedly going to win. This is a factually wrong narrative, this is a morally wrong narrative. It is an abhorrent narrative, and it is a narrative that is currently used to justify terrifying human atrocities in the East of Europe. Never mind the fact that these posts are obvious DISinformation (not just misinformation) - they are lies, they are based on false elements, and fake news, and they undermine our global stability.

Now, I don't know why this has been allowed up until now. Putin's war is based on one thing, and one thing only: the idea that an imperialist, fascist nation with nukes has a natural right to a ""lebensraum"" within a lesser nation's territory. Given the generalizations, lies, and hatred spread by the Russian thug in charge of the band of war criminals they call the ""Russian army"", it can only really be defined as an ethnic and cultural rejection of Ukraine and its people.

Here you give us report options against hate speech. Speech that promotes violence and hatred against identity and vulnerability. If you listen to the Russian rationale for launching the invasion, and examine its actions, you can see that you are:

-Allowing a number of posts that support the idea that the Ukrainian people are lesser than the Russian people, and deserve violence or hatred;  
-Promoting the war rhetoric of an entirely unjustified conflict in Europe, done by an unprovoked aggressor, a war rhetoric whose entire aim is to destabilize and delegitimize the essential rights of Ukrainian people;  
-Aiding and abetting a fascist state that is currently committing egregious human rights abuses, war crimes, and international aggressions, in another sovereign nation, by leaving an outlet for its propagandists and communicators to spread false information and damaging intel.

I urge you today, Reddit, to take down this violent, this hateful, this false content, that promotes nothing but hatred against a nation, and which is used to justify inhumane war crimes.

All of this, of course, ignores the fact that if you actively aid and abet the Russian fascists, you will not be safe in the US for very long. You are promoting westward expansionism by an unstable nuclear nation that has shown it is willing to use violence, including threats of nuclear annihilation, to achieve its goals.

Choose your side, Reddit.""",False,1645902513.0,t3_t23qm5,t3_t23qm5,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Militaries around the globe try to dehumanise the enemy as much as possible to make it easier to kill them. After all, if you don't see somebody as human, putting a bullet through them seems so much easier.

At the end of the day, they are still people. Somebody's parents. Somebody's child. Somebody's friend. All fighting a war they likely don't want to be in.

It's really surprising to see the ignorance I've seen on the internet so far. India cannot afford to break ties with Russia, not at this stage anyway. We have way too many conflicts to settle with China/Pakistan to push Russia away. People laugh at this argument because Russia won't support India over China, which isn't completely wrong. But if India can make sure Russia doesn't start picking sides, that's still a huge positive. Russia being neutral gives India remotest of chances to salvage something, Russia siding with India's neighbours will almost certainly mean a defeat in case of a war. In simple terms, India just has too much to lose if Russia decides to join Pakistan or China and so will do their bit to ensure this doesn't happen.

Setting aside the geopolitical context, It also makes zero economic sense for a country like India to choose sides here. With millions of people still not even getting access to basic needs, I don't see why India should voluntarily choose sides in a war. In simple terms this is not India's war. As much as Indians want peace in the world and have at heart the well-being of Ukranians, India is not in a position to choose sides. It can at best be a mediator, at worst be part of another non-alignment movement.

To all the priviledged redditors from countries that are 'World powers' who take offense at India's lack of action/silence, ask your leaders to not gaslight conflicts, just to showcase political or geopolitical supremacy, that they can't fully commit to.

The tl;dr  -  the west has known for two decades what Putin is like, could have done more against him but chose not to out of self-interest.

First couple of paragraphs:

>In confrontations with Vladimir Putin, the west fights with one hand tied behind its back. It does so by choice, out of timidity, greed and sloth. This has been the case for more than two decades. This is now the case in Ukraine.  
>  
>And this is why we lose.  
>  
>When Russia’s mafioso-president murdered Alexander Litvinenko, invaded Georgia, abetted Syrian war crimes, annexed Crimea, sent mercenary killers to Libya and the Sahel, subverted America’s elections, waged cyber warfare, weaponised the internet and poisoned the Skripals, ensuing punishments were short-lived, ineffective or non-existent.  
>  
>Western politicians and businesses have known for years what kind of man Putin is. They knew what his rogue regime was capable of. Yet many pretended otherwise, or looked away, or took his money, as have far-right parties in France and Italy. They pretended he was normal.  
>  
>This pattern was repeated prior to the Ukraine invasion. Even as they deplored what they called the biggest security threat to Europe since 1945, western leaders failed to act with urgency on their own warnings. They pulled their punches. Now it’s too late.

What I don't think they were prepared for and still don't know how to reconcile is the massive public relations backlash they're facing. Their propaganda no longer works. They went from being a dissenting voice in the modern world to literally being the enemy of pretty much everyone but terrorist states.

What I don't think they really expected at all is how unifying this was going to be for NATO and the US. All their efforts to sow division and dicord are all for naught. NATO is now more unified than they have been since the end of the Cold War and several states on the fence are now likely to join.

Combine this with the fact that their preparations for sanctions depend on a finite supply of cash they stashed in the months leading up to the conflict, and it's expected this war chest won't last but a couple of months.

I really think Putin's plan was to have military 'exercises' then blitz Ukraine and take Kyev, install a puppet government, deal with small sanctions in the interim, and everything would return to normal like after Crimea. He didn't expect Biden to broadcast his every move, or the quick unified response from NATO, or the quick and massive round of sanctions, or the fact that literally every country in Europe is openly giving advanced (but defensive) weapons to Ukraine with absolutely no fear of response.

YouTube bans videos of anti-vaxxers and flat-earthers (and rightfully so), but somehow still allows Russian state channels to spread their propaganda to both Russian and the international community.

Remember, the information war is no less important than the war with weapons. It is necessary that ordinary Russians see the truth of what Putin is doing in Ukraine and start protesting. Remember, the West managed to defeat the Soviet Union without a direct military confrontation thanks to isolation and information warfare.

From Wikipedia:

>The name ""Molotov cocktail"" was coined by the Finns during the Winter War, called Molotovin koktaili in Finnish. The name was a pejorative reference to Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov, who was one of the architects of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact signed in late August 1939.
>
>The name's origin came from the propaganda Molotov produced during the Winter War, mainly his declaration on Soviet state radio that bombing missions over Finland were actually airborne humanitarian food deliveries for their starving neighbours. As a result, the Finns sarcastically dubbed the Soviet cluster bombs ""Molotov bread baskets"" in reference to Molotov's propaganda broadcasts. When the hand-held bottle firebomb was developed to attack and destroy Soviet tanks, the Finns called it the ""Molotov cocktail"", as ""a drink to go with his food parcels"".",False,1645901802.0,t3_t23qm5,t1_hyjmy02,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Edit: Russian casualties were so bad in ww2 for many reasons. Firstly their military upper command had been essentially liquidated in the mid-late 30’s, and their generals were very green. Nazi blitzkrieg also came several months before they expected and they were not fully mobilized, and most of their air force was destroyed on the ground. Blitzkrieg also surrounded entire armies throughout 1941 as the Nazis pushed East. Their armor was better in 41’ and they were able to quite literally encircle hundreds of thousands of men. By 1942 it was a complete meat grinder on a 2000 mile front. Germany’s 6th Army, the one that went to Stalingrad had 95% casualties. American and Japanese forces on Okinawa experienced 100% casualties if you count post war suicide. Nazis also did not take many prisoners and brutally treated the ones they did. The Soviet army gets this reputation because of Stalingrad and the “not one step back order”. While its true this was ordered, in reality by 1942 the Soviets were beginning to be a well supplied professional army with an experienced officer corps. They had heavy losses yes, but they were not throwing their men away with no regard.

Sort of, it’s not perfect from what I understand

Edit:

“

The Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system is used for the defense of Moscow. It became operational in 1995 and was preceded by the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system. The system uses Gorgon and Gazelle missiles with nuclear warheads to intercept incoming ICBMs.


The Israeli Arrow 3 system entered operational service in 2017. It is designed for exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles during the spaceflight portion of their trajectory, including those of ICBMs.[1] It may also act as an anti-satellite weapon”

Aaand just a little more information for anyone scrolling:

“An intercontinental ballistic missile is a missile with a minimum range of 5,500 kilometres primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery. Similarly, conventional, chemical, and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs”

The upshot is the Ukrainians are holding the line, although ""kicking butt"" is debatable: they're outnumbered and outgunned, but Russia keeps screwing up its logistics. 

Early reports indicate Putin wanted to blitz straight to the capital and figure out his supply lines after the fact. But it's Day 3 and Kyiv is still under Ukrainian control, meaning Russia troops are having trouble resupplying. Additionally, Ukraine anticipated these tactics (likely because of NATO-shared intelligence) and flanked Russia's supply lines in several places.

Also, Poland and the Baltic states are so clearly preparing to be next, that NATO avoiding open conflict is short term at best.  I think several states are thinking they need to draw a line now.",False,1645904927.0,t3_t23qm5,t1_hyjua2z,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

We're on day 3 and word is they had expected to seize Hostomel on the first night to act as a staging ground for taking the rest of the city, and the Ukrainians taking it back was a massive blow to their operations. They've allegedly been forced back across the Dnipr in Kherson, and they are struggling in the East. Kharkiv is proving to be exactly as difficult to take as everyone (except the Russians apparently) figured it'd be. The only place the Russians seem to be ""winning"" is Sumy, and even then they're encountering much fiercer resistance than they expected to find in one of Ukraine's most ""Russified"" regions.

Honestly, unless the tactical situation changes soon, I don't see a good outcome for Russia. They might be able to grind through a conventional war of attrition, but a swift and decisive victory already seems out of the picture. Putin gambled everything on the first few days.

People tend to think that the Russian military is vast and inexhaustible, but this isn't true. They are very limited in terms of modern equipment and lack the ability to produce it in the quantities they need, forcing them to rely on their stockpile of cheaper, older, shittier Soviet weaponry. Meanwhile, Ukraine is getting hundreds of millions of dollars worth in military aid, and it is advanced infantry equipment from the West to boot. Russia has more manpower, but they don't have the political capital to mobilize it like Ukraine can. Ukrainians have high morale: they are defending their homeland from a foreign invader. Even the Russians who are hooked on the propaganda sauce are going to think twice about this war now that it is looking this dismal. Even the most patriotic Russian will have doubts about sending potentially hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths over Ukraine.

Putin's regime is also not nearly as stable as people expect. So much of his power comes from his image (for really, power is just an illusion, so the most powerful people are basically magicians) as a strong, able-minded leader and this whole war puts a damper on that. If nothing else, the Russian military's failure to score a quick and decisive victory will reflect badly on Putin's military competency, and likely lose him a lot of support from his officers (provided they aren't all political coolies)

Like, I'm just imaging how things would've turned out in 2003 if the US did as poorly invading Iraq as Russia is in Ukraine. Bush probably wouldn't have been re-elected, even though the US population was just as whipped up by war propaganda fervor as the Russian one currently is.
