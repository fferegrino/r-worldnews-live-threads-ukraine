I will be continuing with my updates from Kharkiv, my first message can be found at the link above.

Even though my location is right next to the Russian border it is actually the safest place to be right now from what I can see. Where I am there’s only rare explosions but even they send shivers through my body, in the past 4 hours there was 1 big explosion that made my whole apartment building tremble, and after some time there was a volley of small explosions, or they were just really far away. Also just now while I’m writing this there were another TWO explosions. And then another 20 second volley of explosions right now when I'm posting it.

On the other hand from what I hear from other people in Northern Saltivka district there’s constant shelling, some of them hit apartment buildings, people are running for the shelters, and our subway stations are pretty much full, because apparently explosions can also be heard in the center of the city and also the subways themselves stopped working. 

It’s weird but basically where I am there’s people just walking around  with their kids while in some other district people are trying to survive, this whole situation is just pure madness.

I don’t even think there’s really a way to end this, I have a lot of acquaintances and family in Russia, and what’s truly frightening is that apparently a lot of them truly believe that what is happening here is the right thing to do. They are unironically saying that they are liberating us from a “regime” and nazis, which I won’t deny do exist here, but their amount is not even close enough to invade a country over. And while Zelensky is a horrible president it was still the people that chose him, not some third party, I personally chose him because it was a choice between “certain evil” and a wildcard, so of course most people chose the latter.

There’s one more thing which I would like to add, you don’t have to believe me, it’s just something that I’ve personally seen. My mom’s friend, who lives in Russia, said that they are apparently mobilizing their people, and by that I mean they are mobilizing their conscripts to go fight a war.

There are also rumors that today we might lose internet connection here, and it’s already a reality in some regions.

Right now I’m at home but with the current situation I might have to go the shelter. I just can’t understand the goal of this whole war, what Putin is doing will never get any Ukrainians on his side. My family was mostly pro-Russian before, but what he did today completely and irreversibly changed our mind, and I believe it’s not just us. You don’t shoot your friend in the leg and then wonder why he doesn’t like you.

UPD.
Street illumination just went out on my whole street, could be a diversion, electricity is still running, but this is starting to get scary.

In a list of requests sent to the EU leaders ahead of an emergency summit on Thursday night in Brussels, Ukraine also calls for the “fiercest restriction measures against Belarus, which directly supported [the] Russian full-scale invasion”.

The paper, drafted by Ukrainian diplomats in Brussels and seen by the Guardian, also calls for:

* ending software licenses for military and civilian equipment in Russia and Belarus;

* blocking or interfering with Russian satellite navigation systems in the air, over the Black Sea and Sea of Azov;

* using all means to block the Russian satellite navigation system Glonass, including jamming its signal over the Black Sea, Sea of Azov, Belarus and Ukrainian airspace.

As well as an appeal to end “business as usual” with Russia, Kyiv wants the EU to open its emergency aid system (the civil protection mechanism) to Ukrainians.

1) When firing, aim for centre of mass. No head shots, you're an untrained civilian and you're more likely to hit your target aiming at their chest. Shoot on an empty breath, don't snatch the trigger, squeeze it for a more accurate shot. No full auto, controlled rounds.

2) Keep moving your firing position if in a fight, staying in one spot will get you killed.

3) No shiny objects on show. No watches, necklaces, rings etc. Light will reflect and give away your position. 

4) Eat and drink as much as you can wherever possible as you don't know where your next meal will be from. Obviously don't drink sewage water.

5) Unless you're going to fight with the army, get out of the cities. If you have a tent and sleeping bags, take them. If you don't, you can build simple shelters from sticks and leaves.

I was in favor of enabling weapon sales to Ukraine and I have strongly condemned the current energy supply and infrastructure policy this country pursues, making Germany somewhat susceptible to blackmail. This situation is benefited by the closeness of our current socialist led government to Russia and their obvious inability to foster a working European security policy that makes war impossible. The later is en large a result of the inability of Germans to see military self defense as a necessary asset to the European security infrastructure.  I can not say that this would not have happened under a different ruling coalition, but surely this one is the least suitable to face this situation. I have been very vocal about this publicly and I have held these views for a long time.

Edit: The reason I think this is important to be voiced right now is to show that a large part of the German populace is in fact aware of the shortcomings of our currently implemented policies and does not favor appeasing Russia in any way.

Whatever the sentiment of the Russian public as a cohort, one of the reasons we aren’t seeing many people pushing back and speaking out publicly is NATIONALISM. You know, the same sort of rhetoric that the last administration pushed so heavily on American conservatives. The idea that Russia as a nation is superior and has a right to lay claim to the land and resources and people and culture of another nation simply because of its own history. There are other factors at play too. Power dynamics in an effective autocracy leave most people hopeless and powerless in the face of something like this military movement.

Still it's a good thing the western world is not actively engaging in this war, yes Ukraine is probably not going to be coming out on top here even with all the western aid they are receiving.

BUT the likelihood of this not being Putin's initial plan is very very high, there is a good chance Putin started this whole ordeal to destabilise the EU and force them to open Nord Stream 2. Yet the western United response most likely took Putin by surprise, Germany's willingness to take the loss on nord stream 2 really disrupted russian plans. 

what proof do we have for this?
1. remember these rushed seeming 'live' press conferences which weren't actually live? obviously the general staff was not prepared for this course of action their PR was disorganized.
2. Putin's TV speeches seem below his standard, hinting that this has not been planned for a long time.
3. the lacking supply structure in the Russian military are obvious, starving soldiers, etc. indicate that Russia didn't predict to have to stand by for this long.

so why invade then? the russian people dont want war, Putin can't really afford to lose thousands of soldiers, hundreds of millions in equipment in the marshes of Ukraine or billions due to sanctions in an already declining economy. 
Putin needs his threads to carry weight otherwise he'll lose a lot of his power, even if it means risking stability in Russia which is currently a very unstable country.

Putin played himself into a corner and to attack is his only move.

tl:dr the united western response mostly likely threw off Putin's initial plan, forcing him to invade so his future threads dont lose political weight",False,1645717521.0,t3_t0csmq,t3_t0csmq,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Edit: what you are all saying is that NATO is impotent and Russia will now know for sure that they can start wars of aggression with anyone as long as they haven't joined NATO yet. Next could be Finland, after that Sweden. All Russia has to do is say ""we have nukes"" and they can keep screwing with everybody and annexing territory.

All NATO can do is wat their finger and give Russia a stern look. As long as Putin and his cohorts sit in Russia a nuclear war is inevitable, be Aude at some point they will no longer have any non NATO countries to bully because they will have annexed them all.

In the meantime Russia is destabilizing the ""free world"" by dividing tye populations of countries through psyops campaigns, as they have done for over a decade. 

I'll take the down votes. But i stand by my point, NATO is impotent against the machinations of madmen and this will lead to nothing good.

I'm not Ukrainian, but my mother has made Ukrainian Psanky Easter eggs for my entire life. I spent so many hours, year round, sitting at our old wooden kitchen table, scribbling on eggs with beeswax, staining my fingertips with dye, and burning myself on candles as I melted the wax off, etc. I can remember giving a presentation about the eggs in my 5th grade computer class. I had an art show in 8th grade where I showed off all the eggs I had worked on that year.

I'm 25 now. I haven't made an egg since high school, although my mother still does them year round. But this morning all I could think about was how making the eggs was prohibited by the Soviet Union because it was considered a religious practice, and the art form was almost lost.

So for the first time in nearly 8 years I'm going to pick up the art form again. I'm going to make the eggs again and try to sell them to donate the proceeds to aid those in Ukraine.

So, my friend groups of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Moldvins (Moldavians in English?), and their family members who have expressed support of me and are kind, loving people in general (several are from my bio-parents church even, of all places) are not the average person and are more “liberal/open minded/anti-dictatorship” folks.

It’s like the strong filial piety that is demanded of children to their parents and relatives in Russia/in Russian culture and other interdependent cultures, but not just to family - it includes unquestioning and unwavering loyalty to the state and its dictator(s) (which ofc most people don’t call Putin that in public, and most older folks I know won’t even engage in talks about this….so much is fear based and not even explored as a possibility). 

After living in the US for a while, when I come back, I’m shocked at how much people feel betrayed that you left and especially if you have differing views than full support of Russia. The forced assimilation and pressure of unwavering loyalty is strong in Russia and feels very alienating. It took meeting young folks (often they also have lived outside of Russia and have seen different ways of life, cultures, and perspectives, are embracing of many more human rights) via other safe people who feel the same way to find those who think similarly. 

IMO if Russian people as a group were a psych disorder it would be Complex-PTSD with some Stockholm Syndrome, and under the thumb of the Narcissist Putin, where they feel no safety or space to question him, not even does it cross their minds to do so. Many people have not traveled due to poverty and brainwashing by state media and warnings from the government and older generations who have been brainwashed about how much “they” (meaning everyone outside of Russia) supposedly hates all Russians overseas (not altogether untrue but WAY over-exaggerated), nor do they have the exposure to the many subcultures of the world and the possibilities. They are taught that the enemy is everyone else from a young age, and brainwashed by propaganda that everyone hates Russia. Government run media plays a huge role in this…it doesn’t sound like a huge deal and one would think you’d be “above it” but it’s way more powerful than one would think, especially when you are shut down hard and punished for questioning it - punished by being socially ostracized and gossiped about for being a “traitor” among family and friends, for being a supposed traitor to your country for even asking, etc.

NATO countries can't touch Russia or we will see nuclear war that destroys the US, UK, and France. NATO is a defensive alliance but one of their major stipulations is that their members never engage in offensive war. NATO's major countries have circumvented this(in a bullshit way obviously) by just never declaring war, but that was under the guise of fighting terrorism, etc. rather than fighting a unified non-NATO country(much less Russia, which has 1000 nuclear weapons pointed at the US that can land in 30 minutes or less)

**Russia has maintained for the last 70 years that they would not attack NATO, but if NATO touches them they would rather pull the nuclear trigger than try to beat all of the NATO militaries.** They have made clear they believe they cannot beat the combined might of NATO but are happy to just end the US, UK, and France to ensure they do not get destroyed without retaliating. That may have been a bluff 60 years ago but they have said it enough times that the US will immediately presume nukes if NATO gets into any battle with Russia whatsoever. Any NATO ally attacking Russia means we are probably within a few hours of Russia, US, UK, and France being gone as we know them. That paradigm has been on the table for 60+ years. Every US president has been briefed on the fact that if Russia ever gets in a battle with a NATO ally it is understood that we have a ""mutually assured destruction"" scenario that has essentially been discussed until it is common knowledge by all parties involved. **Russia has pulled the ""We will just blow you up"" card too many times to EVER go back. The immediate assumption will be that they are going to, which means we will, which means they will.**

I hope that makes sense, but in summary:

If any NATO special forces throw a rock across the border we may be hours or minutes away from 1000 nuclear strikes on US soil many times larger than Hiroshima. That is not to mention essentially the elimination of the UK and France from the face of the earth. Think about that before you say things like this.

Sanctions are the ONLY NATO OPTION. Please remember this before you say this kind of stuff. We do not want popular opinion to skew towards the desire for NATO to attack Russia. That is an end of the world scenario, period.

NATO is a defensive alliance but one of their major stipulations is that their members never engage in offensive war. NATO's major countries have circumvented this(in a bullshit way obviously) by just never declaring war, but that was under the guise of fighting terrorism, etc. rather than fighting a unified non-NATO country(much less Russia, which has 1000 nuclear weapons pointed at the US that can land in 30 minutes or less)  
  
Russia has maintained for the last 70 years that they would not attack NATO, but if NATO touches them they would rather pull the nuclear trigger than try to beat all of the NATO militaries. They have made clear they believe they cannot beat the combined might of NATO but are happy to just end the US, UK, and France to ensure they do not get destroyed without retaliating. That may have been a bluff 60 years ago but they have said it enough times that the US will immediately presume nukes if NATO gets into any battle with Russia whatsoever. Any NATO ally attacking Russia means we are probably within a few hours of Russia, US, UK, and France being gone as we know them. That paradigm has been on the table for 60+ years. Every US president has been briefed on the fact that if Russia ever gets in a battle with a NATO ally it is understood that we have a ""mutually assured destruction"" scenario that has essentially been discussed until it is common knowledge by all parties involved. Russia has pulled the ""We will just blow you up"" card too many times to EVER go back. The immediate assumption will be that they are going to, which means we will, which means they will.  
  
I hope that makes sense, but in summary:

* The West has been warning of an invasion for weeks, huge amounts of foreign citizens (and Ukrainina citizens) have fled
* Russia also will not want to be clearly broadcasting its operations.
* When compared to Afghanistan or Iraq, Russia is not predominantly an air power, they are an artillery power. We've still seen plenty of air action, but they rely on motor artillery for the majority of their firepower

We also don't have much idea of how close the Russian forces are to Kiev - some airborne troops are on the outskirts, but even going at a decent pace the first Russia armour probably wouldn't arrive until this evening, and that itself is dependent on resistance that is reached.

Currently, Putin is claiming that the Ukraine is an illegal puppet state of Western powers and that the government is illegitimate and becoming controlled by European powers, being pulled away from Russia against the will of it's (the Ukrainian) people and being forced into joining NATO which is a deliberate attack against Russia. He is also claiming as part of this that the Ukrainian government is committing a genocide against Ethnic-Russians living in the eastern states (that border Russia).

It looked like Ukraine was going to be the next country to join NATO and the EU. In order to regain influence in the region Russia is going to install a puppet government.

This invasion is also a message to other countries in the region to not flirt with ""the west"" and to support Russian Interests instead.

NATO is a defensive alliance but one of their major stipulations is that their members never engage in offensive war. NATO's major countries have circumvented this(in a bullshit way obviously) by just never declaring war, but that was under the guise of fighting terrorism, etc. rather than fighting a unified non-NATO country(much less Russia, which has 1000 nuclear weapons pointed at the US that can land in 30 minutes or less)  
  
Russia has maintained for the last 70 years that they would not attack NATO, but if NATO touches them they would rather pull the nuclear trigger than try to beat all of the NATO militaries. They have made clear they believe they cannot beat the combined might of NATO but are happy to just end the US, UK, and France to ensure they do not get destroyed without retaliating. That may have been a bluff 60 years ago but they have said it enough times that the US will immediately presume nukes if NATO gets into any battle with Russia whatsoever. Any NATO ally attacking Russia means we are probably within a few hours of Russia, US, UK, and France being gone as we know them. That paradigm has been on the table for 60+ years. Every US president has been briefed on the fact that if Russia ever gets in a battle with a NATO ally it is understood that we have a ""mutually assured destruction"" scenario that has essentially been discussed until it is common knowledge by all parties involved. Russia has pulled the ""We will just blow you up"" card too many times to EVER go back. The immediate assumption will be that they are going to, which means we will, which means they will.  
  
I hope that makes sense, but in summary:  
  
If any NATO special forces throw a rock across the border we may be hours or minutes away from 1000 nuclear strikes on US soil many times larger than Hiroshima. That is not to mention essentially the elimination of the UK and France from the face of the earth. Think about that before you say things like this.  
  
Sanctions are the ONLY NATO OPTION. Please remember this before you say this kind of stuff. We do not want popular opinion to skew towards the desire for NATO to attack Russia. That is an end of the world scenario, period.

Specifically, Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.

Russia has, ever since, argued that since ethnic Russians exist in Ukraine as a minority, Ukranians are just Russians, and have no right to self-determination. 

That's it, really. If Putin actually wanted a buffer zone between Russia and the NATO countries, he would leave Ukraine in place.

Ukraine had a significant revolution and became more Western oriented which wasn't the end of the world, but understandably ticked off Putin.  And lately some of that western-oriented ideology has started spreading Belarus.  Putin can't have that, so he' bringing the hammer down.

2. Putin is under pressure at home.  Russia has massive internal problems, and a great patriotic war to reclaim what ""should"" be part of Russia from ""Nazis"" (all according to his propaganda, mind you - none of it is really that simple) is a great distraction.

NATO is a defensive alliance but one of their major stipulations is that their members never engage in offensive war. NATO's major countries have circumvented this(in a bullshit way obviously) by just never declaring war, but that was under the guise of fighting terrorism, etc. rather than fighting a unified non-NATO country(much less Russia, which has 1000 nuclear weapons pointed at the US that can land in 30 minutes or less)

**Russia has maintained for the last 70 years that they would not attack NATO, but if NATO touches them they would rather pull the nuclear trigger than try to beat all of the NATO militaries.** They have made clear they believe they cannot beat the combined might of NATO but are happy to just end the US, UK, and France to ensure they do not get destroyed without retaliating. That may have been a bluff 60 years ago but they have said it enough times that the US will immediately presume nukes if NATO gets into any battle with Russia whatsoever. Any NATO ally attacking Russia means we are probably within a few hours of Russia, US, UK, and France being gone as we know them. That paradigm has been on the table for 60+ years. Every US president has been briefed on the fact that if Russia ever gets in a battle with a NATO ally it is understood that we have a ""mutually assured destruction"" scenario that has essentially been discussed until it is common knowledge by all parties involved. **Russia has pulled the ""We will just blow you up"" card too many times to EVER go back.** The immediate assumption will be that they are going to, which means we will, which means they will.

I hope that makes sense, but in summary:

If any NATO special forces throw a rock across the border we may be hours or minutes away from 1000 nuclear strikes on US soil many times larger than Hiroshima. That is not to mention essentially the elimination of the UK and France from the face of the earth. Think about that before you say things like this.

It is an enormously slippery slope when you attack from a neighboring country. Russia is focusing on airports and supplies first -- you don't think that if Poland got involved Russia would attack their supplies? Think here. This does not happen in a bubble. You cannot send Polish troops into Ukraine without the understanding that they are benefitting from Polish supply chains, communications, and production -- making Polish supply chains, communications, and production a Russian target. If Russia then drops one bomb on one Polish train yard, cell tower, anything....end of the world. Right there.

Regardless, Ukraine's best bet is to evacuate civilians and to get them to the NATO countries. Poland, as far as I know, is still welcoming refugees. And if no civilians are present, or at the very least relatively few, then the Ukrainian military can do whatever they need to do.

And again, everything that's happening is well within what the Ukrainians were anticipating. I think that they can certainly hold a guerrilla war, albeit an unconventional one. And if they eliminate certain threats to them and any structures that could potentially fall into enemy hands, like an airfield, then they can fortify key cities and hunker down.

What Ukraine needs to do, and what they doubtlessly are going to do, is make Russia pay for every mile they take. Already in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several other major Russian cities, the Russian people are protesting. They didn't want this war, and it's quite clear that Russia doesn't really have much of a complex strategy from the looks of it. The only major concern is the Crimean front from what I can glean on the news, which has been largely unopposed for the Russians. But I don't think that's an oversight on Ukraine's part.

I edited my post to make it more thorough. To reiterate what I edited in because I think it answers your question:

I understand it is deeply uncomfortable to face the fact that Russia(and China) have a lot of power to just do whatever they want as long as they don't touch NATO. But we have known that since the Cold War. This is the stuff that kept your grandparents up at night -- we just had a period of relative quiet regarding the nuclear issue for the last 35 or so years. Most people young enough to be posting on Reddit never dealt with the harsh realities of nuclear geopolitics as an adult. Only people in their 60s remember the first time we went through all of this. We almost had a ""the world is over"" scenario during the Bay of Pigs incident because the US tried to get too involved in a territory Russia was involved in. NATO and Russia need to stay as far apart as possible and that fact has framed most geopolitical decisions for the last 60+ years.

This is not armchair politics or ""doing the right thing"" -- this is the most important issue of the 20th century(even moreso than the world wars) rearing its head again after a generation or two of quiet. Our generation is not yet accustomed to the nuclear fear but it is the defining issue on our entire planet and supersedes by far concerns like the independence and freedom of a single country.

This is not a video game where you get to try again if you fuck up. This is real human beings being terrified of accidentally re-creating the Bay of Pigs by trying to do the right thing. **Kennedy was bold in the face of Russia and he almost ended the world over it.**",1645717704.0,1645717416.0,t3_t0csmq,t1_hy93tz1,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Every country has had the option to join NATO if they were willing to comply with military and human rights rules. The line is drawn at those countries which decided to take the risk and be self-interested. Ukraine is in an awkward spot, Taiwan is in an awkward spot, but very few other countries have had difficulties in joining NATO if they wanted to.

Obviously the citizens of many of these countries are not at fault. They are the ones that suffer. But the way to maintain the world order you are discussing is by continuing to convince any countries we can to join NATO and continue to stand firm on not supporting warmongering countries financially(which we do through sanctions)

Don't say someone's committing a fallacy when you don't know how the fallacy works, it comes off as trying to engage in bad faith. I didn't say ""just do whatever the guy in the lab coat says"", I simply pointed out that you are absolutely not capable of fully understanding the data across widely divergent fields so you shouldn't act like you are. In light of this, the only scientific option when faced with a question in a field you know nothing about is to defer to scientific consensus and expert opinion (the other option is to literally abandon science and not think scientifically about the issue, which I assume you don't want to advocate for). No one can be an expert in all fields, and acting like you can is an act of extreme hubris. It's how populations become blind to their own ignorance by thinking themselves smarter than the people who actually understand what's going on. Deferring to expert advice is not an ""appeal to authority"". It's the basic, scientific, and rational thing to do when one is ignorant of the field and has no reason to think that the experts are deeply misguided. Sure, the experts may be wrong, but you're hardly in a position to judge that for yourself given that you're not an expert. Your attempt to judge that for yourself is more likely to lead you astray than lead you to the truth of the matter. As it stands, your ""appeal to authority"" charge is hollow because the only thing you seem to think doesn't amount to an ""appeal to authority"" is literally ignoring any and all expert advice. But that is absolutely not how the appeal to authority fallacy works, nor does it recommend that we ignore and and all expert advice as you demand.

> one more real example, if a physician who is an 'expert in medicine' recommends an extremely risky procedure, but I, a chemist read the scientific study saying the risky procedure is dangerous and there is a safe alternative

So you think reading one study in a field you aren't familiar with makes you better informed than someone who has made it their life's work to understand that field? What if that study is wrong? What if its methodology is flawed? What if it's an outlier? How can you assess any of those claims after reading one paper? That's the scientific equivalent of just clicking the first Google result and then confidently proclaiming that you are now an expert on the topic you googled.

It may very well be the case that you are in fact right and the expert is wrong, but surely you can see how you couldn't possibly be able to know this since you aren't an expert in the field? Again, this isn't scientific thinking, it's ignorant hubris. The physician may be wrong, it's perfectly reasonable to question that, but you are hardly in a position to recognize that given that you know nothing about the topic in question. Your best bet is to ask another physician (another expert) for their advice, not to ""do your own research"" on a field you know nothing about and ""come to your own conclusions"" in the span of an afternoon. This is why we ask for second opinions rather than simply making up our own opinions as we're very bad at doing the latter. The sort of reasoning you are advocating for is how stuff like Ivermectin became a ""covid cure"". It leads to people confidently adopting pseudoscience beliefs and rejecting perfectly sound expert opinion simply because it's ""expert opinion"".

> There are no pieces of paper, certifications, or humans in science. Its only the scientific method.

My god go read Thomas Kuhn's ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" this instant because no one who studies this field believes any of this in the slightest. This view of science has been thoroughly discredited over the past 80 years. No one who studies this stuff believes this at all, it's simply an over-idealized fiction that doesn't match reality and history (I have a Masters in the History and Philosophy of Science in addition to my Bachelors in Biology). Science is an extremely messy human enterprise, there is no method to science that guarantees true, accurate, and impartial results.
