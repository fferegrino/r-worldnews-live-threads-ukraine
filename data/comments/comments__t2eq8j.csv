I think Putin or whoever it is making the military decisions expected their paratroopers and saboteurs to do the heavy lifting. Sneak in, cause chaos, kill the leadership, shove their hand up the nearest puppets ass and then start making excuses. But those paratroopers can't do much good when they are getting shot out of the sky. And those ground forces can't do much good when they move away from rail and run out of supplies.

Great summary here:



 Russian forces‚Äô main axes of advance in the last 24 hours focused on Kyiv, northeastern Ukraine, and southern Ukraine. Russian airborne and special forces troops are engaged in urban warfare in northwestern Kyiv, but Russian mechanized forces are not yet in the capital. Russian forces from Crimea have changed their primary axes of advance from a presumed drive toward Odesa to focus on pushing north toward Zaporizhie and the southeastern bend of the Dnipro River and east along the Azov Sea coast toward Mariupol. These advances risk cutting off the large concentrations of Ukrainian forces still defending the former line of contact between unoccupied Ukraine and occupied Donbas. Ukrainian leaders may soon face the painful decision of ordering the withdrawal of those forces and the ceding of more of eastern Ukraine or allowing much of Ukraine‚Äôs uncommitted conventional combat power to be encircled and destroyed. There are no indications as yet of whether the Ukrainian government is considering this decision point.

Ukrainian resistance remains remarkably effective and Russian operations especially on the Kyiv axis have been poorly coordinated and executed, leading to significant Russian failures on that axis and at Kharkiv. Russian forces remain much larger and more capable than Ukraine‚Äôs conventional military, however, and Russian advances in southern Ukraine may threaten to unhinge the defense of Kyiv and northeastern Ukraine if they continue unchecked.",False,1645934287.0,t3_t2eq8j,t3_t2eq8j,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

Google has said it is pausing monetization of Russian state-funded media and barring the outlets from running ads across its services, according to a statement seen by Reuters.

Russia‚Äôs state-owned media outlet RT and other channels will be barred from receiving money for ads on their websites, apps and YouTube videos, similar to a move by Facebook after the invasion of Ukraine.

Citing ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances,‚Äù Google‚Äôs YouTube unit said it was ‚Äúpausing a number of channels‚Äô ability to monetize on YouTube.‚Äù

These included several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions, such as those by the European Union.

Ad placement is largely controlled by YouTube.

Google added later that it was also barring Russian state-funded media outlets from using its ad technology to generate revenue on their own websites and apps.

In addition, the Russian media will not be able to buy ads through Google Tools or place ads on Google services such as search and Gmail, spokesman Michael Aciman said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actively monitoring new developments and will take further steps if necessary,‚Äù Aciman said.

On Wednesday, the European Union unveiled sanctions on individuals such as Margarita Simonyan, whom it called RT‚Äôs editor-in-chief and ‚Äúa central figure‚Äù of Russian propaganda.

Videos from affected media will also come up less often in recommendations, YouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo said. He added that RT and several other channels would no longer be accessible in Ukraine after a Ukrainian government request.

Yeah, it sucks. Nobody wants to risk arrest and possible torture. But it's either take that risk and more or basically become North Korea and be cut off from the world. It's their choice whether they want to rebel and take down a dictator or just let that dictator become the Hitler of the 21st Century. In either case, it's going to be a shit time. Just in the former choice, that shit time is moved up a bit and, hopefully, a much shorter time.

As dawn breaks in Kyiv and multiples towns and cities across Ukraine wake to find scenes of destruction, here is where the situation currently stands:

Western allies have agreed to block Russia‚Äôs access to the Swift international banking payment system. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove ‚Äúselected Russian banks‚Äù from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday.

There are reports that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack, while an oil terminal in Vasylkiv, south-west of the capital, Kyiv, has also been targeted. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion in Kharkiv could cause an ‚Äúenvironmental catastrophe‚Äù and advised people to cover their windows.

The 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed while defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment ‚Äì reportedly telling a Russian navy warship to ‚Äúgo fuck yourself‚Äù when asked to surrender ‚Äì may still be alive, according to Ukrainian officials.

Britain is preparing a ‚Äúhit list‚Äù of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said.

Truss said there would be ‚Äúnowhere left to hide‚Äù for the super-rich allies of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Kremlin. She told the Sunday Times that new names would be added to the list every few weeks as ministers seek to ratchet up the pressure on Putin.

Liquor stores and bars in the US and Canada are targeting Russia‚Äôs national drink in a show of unity with the people of Ukraine. Shelves in both countries are being stripped of Russian vodka, with the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, announcing on Saturday the removal of ‚ÄúRussian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice‚Äù.

Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‚ÄòMickey‚Äô Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia‚Äôs invasion ‚Äúa challenge to democracy‚Äù. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1bn yen ($8.7m) will go toward ‚Äúhumanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence‚Äù, Agence France-Presse reported.

A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook post: ‚ÄúThe enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain. Let us help them get straight to hell.‚Äù

Influence operations are designed to passivize you, make you feel helpless (you're not!) and drive public sentiment in support of an illegal military invasion.

Recent operations appear to include:
  
1. NATO/Generational/Political division comments (trump, biden, germany, boomers, gen-z, whatever) 
2. ""Wont someone think of the poor Russian soldier?""  
3. ""Nukes! Are we going to die from nukes now? I'm so afraid""  (Probably not)
4. ""GhOsT oF KyIv Is FaKe/Snake Island is alive, they surrendered!"" (https://twitter.com/poroshenko/status/1497293195763408905) 
5. Posting propaganda or bad takes as a question or as though you were arguing against them (e.g. My dad thinks Ukraine...)  
6. ""Russias best forces are in reserve""  
7. ""OMG *thermobaric weapons* are going to be used if we don't give in to Putin""
8. ""tHe cHeChEns aRe CoMiNg!1""
9. ""If NATO and Russian forces touch/shootdown a plane/see each other, WW3 begins"" (counterexample https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-air_combat_losses_between_the_Soviet_Union_and_the_United_States)

Hello, as we know there is an invasion of Ukraine from Russia in its 3rd going on 4th day for them. President Biden has called upon Congress to draft a Ukrainian aid bill. If you're also in favor of supporting Ukraine, here is a boilerplate message to send them with links to contact them:  
  
""Dear Senator $SenatorLastName,  
  
On Thursday President Joe Biden has called upon Congress to sign a $6.2B aid bill to assist Ukraine during their time of need. $2.7B will go towards Ukrainian refugees, humanitarian efforts in bordering NATO countries, armament and munitions. Armament and munitions will include desperately needed Anti-Tank and Anti-Air weaponry for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The remaining $3.5B will go to the Pentagon to bolster cybersecurity readiness and operations as well as continued logistics and intelligence operations in bordering NATO countries. Part of that money going to the Pentagon should also be given to NIST, CISA, and US-CERT to assist with blue team operations to provide new hashes, signatures, and guidance on new Russian cyber attacks; the cybersecurity world at large was strained starting Wednesday with the introduction of Russia's new Cyclops Blink sandworm malware with US NOCs, SOCs, antivirus vendors, and firewall manufacturers working closely with IT departments, public and private, for preparedness and remediation.  
  
Ukraine is a legitimate, westernizing democracy whose leaders remain in-country in full kit with their armed forces. They are not just repelling a Russian invasion, they are fighting for their lives, for their homes, for democracy, and for their future. The US and Ukraine have worked collaboratively within the spheres of cybersecurity, global health, and business development across American agencies, NGOs, and private industries. We the people say ""No!"" to Putin's fascist aims and reject authoritarianism wherever it may be present in the world. Ukraine was set to be the eastern-most beacon of hope and Democracy in Europe and with previous attempts of theirs at joining NATO and/or the EU not coming to fruition, this is the least we can do as a leading Democracy to help maintain a free world.  
  
Ukraine can hold, repel, and reorganize against their Russian threats with a higher confidence and a higher probability with such assistance and we say it's time to help make this war more symmetrical for Ukraine.

I know, risk of WWIII etc, but consider this. 

A salvo of TOS1 rockets will incinerate, suffocate or horrifically burn everything within a 200-400 meter radius. Because of the heat, and negative pressure effects, bunkers, basements and shelters aren't going to save civilians in that radius. 

If you happen to live in a city, think about how many people live in a 200-400m radius of you. How many families, how many little kids. Men, women, children everyone. Now picture them all burning or choking to death.

Hell, even if you're worried about the risk of a nuclear exchange, consider the response from the western public if Putin does this. When they see the pictures of the result, public opinion is going to get utterly visceral and there is going to be a huge risk that this spirals out of control then- if this has been ordered the best chance of preventing a war between NATO and Russia might well be to stop them before they do this, because after they do, political leaders in democracies are going to be facing huge pressure to act.

If we have credible intelligence that this has been ordered, the US and NATO need to issue an immediate ultimatum, not just to Putin but to every russian commander in the field.

Securing their ability to monitor movement around Kyiv, coordinate highly accurate artillery strikes, and execute 'predator drone'-style attacks must be a integral part of their strategy. 

Below are maps of reported attacks thus far:

Obviously a lot of that is air/missile assault, but the Russians must be watching potential supply routes closely, and if they could reach every spot around Kyiv's perimeter to attack yesterday, they can certainly do so today ([reports](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/26/russia-ukraine-invasion-update/6947419001/) are that there are 30k more Russian troops in Ukraine than there were Friday). 

[Russian forces](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/ai2html/ground-incursions/UU44NYRGH5HOFBVWVGI44CYDLE/2300-ground-incursions-0225-v1.jpg?c=1645921248046) (mechanized infantry, armor, support) seem to be amassing slowly as they move south towards Kyiv from the north on both sides of the Dneiper River. That map is interesting, as it shows that their South-Western force (from Crimea) went East instead of West. I could be wrong, but it seems to me that they felt comfortable doing this because they felt they had enough time and capacity to cut Kyiv off from the Southwest using their West most invasion force from the North (the one that splintered off near Antonov Airport). [This Map](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/220113_Jones_UkraineRussia_Map3.png?CcNBYWLgf06i_Lg2Dr8GFhxMlDb0dZ9D) shows suggested plans after the first wave, which is interesting. 

If even smaller parts of that force get to [Zhytomyr and Bila Tserkva](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bila+Tserkva,+Kyiv+Oblast,+Ukraine,+09100/@50.2266601,29.8023517,8z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sStoyanka!3m4!1s0x40d3423e37227b9d:0x84e311f8582cc6e8!8m2!3d49.7967796!4d30.1310349), they'll be pretty well placed to intercept supplies on the ground via road/[rail](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Rail_Map_Ukraine.png). Personally I think that's why they haven't launched a massive assault on Kyiv yet, they're focused on securing logistics routes around the city. They failed to keep the airport yesterday, but I'd be shocked if they don't hold it now... With a fair number of troops in the cities SW of Kyiv, and control of the the 2 main airports in the area, they'd be pretty well placed to keep supplies out of the Capital. 

It's looking like there's a chance they may not pull it off, which i'm obviously hoping for... but the odds are still greatly in Russia's favor unfortunately... and as Putin gets more desperate, I think we'll see some truly horrific acts of war.",1645936149.0,1645934978.0,t3_t2eq8j,t3_t2eq8j,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Zelenskyy was supposed to have ran off and gone in to exile, like many thought he would in Poland. However he didn't, he stayed, and became not just a Ukrainian icon, but an international one. There'll be outrage if he dies, and if Putin does install a puppet government after he'll never have a unified country(not that it's super likely either way, but it'd be less likely after).

Most of the conventional Ukrainian army is likely still near the front in the Donetsk region and at risk of being cut off if the forces around Kharkiv and coming north from Crimea cut them off by pushing towards Dnipro. 

If they were pulled back, which would be difficult because it's over one hundred miles to the Dnieper River - they might be able to get across before they're surrounded and cut off from the rest of Ukraine and would be enormously helpful in defending Kyiv and any possible future incursions at Kherson in the south or from western Belarus towards Lviv. The downside to this is that they'd be leaving half the country to the Russian invaders, including Kharkiv and Mariupol. Additionally, trying to move out from their defensive positions near Donetsk would make them vulnerable to all sorts of attacks in transit. 

Either way, it's a terrible sacrifice to make - allowing them to be cut off from the rest of the country and losing some of their best troops or functionally retreating out of the eastern half of the country - and one that is almost certainly being debated as I type this among Ukrainian high command.

This page from the US Holocaust memorial museum website. [https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-german-army-and-the-racial-nature-of-the-war-against-the-soviet-union](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-german-army-and-the-racial-nature-of-the-war-against-the-soviet-union)

>According to Nazi ideology, Slavs were useless subhumans. As such, their leaders, the Soviet elite, were to be killed and the remainder of the population enslaved or expelled further eastward. As a result of these racist fantasies, millions of Soviet civilians were deliberately killed, starved, or worked to death. Millions of others were deported for forced labor in Germany or enslaved in the occupied eastern territories. German planners called for the ruthless exploitation of Soviet resources, especially of agricultural produce. This was one of Germany's major war aims in the east.  
>  
>In the context of this brutal war of annihilation, German forces in 1941 had little regard for the Soviet civilian population. This was the result not only of Nazi propaganda ‚Äîin which the Soviet population was portrayed as subhuman‚Äîbut also of the basic orders issued by the military leadership. Hitler's directive for the attack on the Soviet Union, the ""Barbarossa"" decree, called on the German troops to react to any type of resistance, even passive resistance, with shooting. German forces burned entire villages and shot the rural population of whole districts in retaliation for partisan attacks. On the other hand, military authorities made it clear that crimes committed by German soldiers were not to be punished if they claimed to have ideological considerations as their motive. This was an open invitation for soldiers to behave brutally.

When I Nazi I think of Hitlers Army who killed millions of people for being Jewish. So Putin is using the term Nazism trying to evoke memories of the brutal killings of millions of Slavs (Slavs are subdivided into East Slavs (chiefly Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians), West Slavs (chiefly Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Wends, or Sorbs), and South Slavs (chiefly Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Slovenes, Macedonians, and Montenegrins).) which is totally fucking insane. There is no Genocide happening in the separatist regions and the President of Ukraine is not calling for anything like that.

IMO Putin has lost it and is doing the exact thing he's accusing the other side of. I don't have any good answer or idea for how to stop him. I really hope Marco's last Tweet makes the Russian military think twice about following orders. I also hope someone can get to Putin and stop him once he's totally isolated the country from the rest of the world. My fear as a US citizen is that he has a group of die hard followers that will go along with literally anything he says. I saw this with our last president.

I also hope this turns citizens in Democratic countries to stop putting strongmen jackass hateful leaders into power.",False,1645934673.0,t3_t2eq8j,t3_t2eq8j,,0,-12,0,-12,0,0,

From everything we have seen, Ukrainians are fighting like hell and have maintained amazing morale, all things considered. And it makes sense. Zelenskyy has been an absolutely amazing leader in this conflict, and Ukrainians are fiercely patriotic fighting for their homeland against a bitter rival. 

Apparently at least some of the Russians didn't even know they were at war or even in Ukraine. Maybe they're just lying in hopes of better treatment, but some of the videos I've seen have captured Russians claiming they thought they were undergoing training exercises in Belarus until the fighting started. 

Add all that onto the simple fact that playing defense is easier. It's much easier to defend a location than it is to take it. With all that accounted for, it would make sense why the Ukrainians are massively overperforming relative to their numbers and funding.

Putin is also probably somewhat trying to minimize casualties to face less upheaval if they do manage to annex Ukraine. That diminishes some of the overwhelming force they can use.

1. Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.
2. The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
3. A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
4. Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.

Manafort is the worst person in this entire shitshow.

I present to you an incomplete list of Manafort's bullshit:

*******

Manafort's past clients include:

- **Ferdinand Marcos** - Authoritarian leader of the Philippines 1965-1986. His regime was famous for its corruption and extreme brutality, and supported by the US government. In 1986 Marcos fled the Philippines with his stolen wealth and was granted asylum by the US government, where he lived the rest of his life in exile.


- **Mobutu Sese Soko** - Military dictator of DRC / Zaire 1965-1997. Seized power through military coup d'etat. *The* classic African dictator - deeply criminal but willing to be a US ally, Mobutu destroyed his country through nepotism and embezzlement. In 1997 Mobutu fled Zaire and lived the rest of his life in exile.


- **Sani Abacha** - De facto President of Nigeria 1993-1998. Seized power through military coup d'etat, for the ~5 years he and his family were in power they stole $5+ billion from the government.


- **Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo** - President of Equatorial Guinea 1979-present. Seized power through military coup d'etat, currently the ~~second~~ longest-serving non-royal leader in the world. His government is effectively a legal dictatorship, and has been marked by corruption.


- **Siad Barre** - President of Somalia 1969-1991. Seized power through coup d'etat. Regime characterized by widespread human rights abuses and authoritarian rule. In 1991 Barre fled Somalia and lived the rest of his life in exile.


- **Daniel arap Moi** - President of Kenya 1978-2002. In 1992 Moi was forced to hold free and open elections; this is the year his party paid $660,000 to Manafort's lobbying firm. Moi's party won. Moi's 24-year rule was maked by corruption (The [Goldenberg scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldenberg_scandal) alone equalled to theft of 10% of Kenya's GDP), political violence, and [widespread human rights abuses.](https://web.archive.org/web/20051130051054/http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/kenya/document.do?id=AF95118DFE41371C802568E400729F0A)

- **Government of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)** - From 1990-1995, Manafort's firm received $4 million to covertly influence US policy towards Pakistan. [This involved creating a fake US-based nonprofit - The Kashmiri American Council - which under false pretenses lobbied on behalf of Pakistan.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/us-elections-2016/Donald-Trump-campaign-hit-by-links-to-Pakistans-ISI/articleshow/51888448.cms)


- **Viktor Yanukovych** - President of Ukraine 2010-2014. In 2014 Yanukovych fled Ukraine; he is currently living in exile and wanted in Ukraine for treason.


- **Donald Trump** - President of the United States 2017-present.

********

Manafort was *so good at his job* that his name is mentioned over 80 times in this 1992 report:

[The Torturer's Lobby: How Human Rights-Abusing Nations Are Represented in Washington](https://cloudfront-files-1.publicintegrity.org/legacy_projects/pdf_reports/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf) [pdf link]

********


A mid-2000s Transparency International report [listed the world's top 4 kleptocrats](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/26/indonesia.philippines). 3 were Manafort clients:


> - Suharto (Indonesia, $15-35 billion)
- Ferdinand Marcos (The Philippines, $5-10 billion) ‚Äì **Manafort client**
- Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, $5 billion) ‚Äì **Manafort client**
- Sani Abacha (Nigeria, $2-5 billion) ‚Äì **Manafort client**


********

In 2013, Manafort admitted to French investigators that he played a middleman role in a botched illegal arms deal that lead to the death of a dozen French engineers.

Manafort's very first international client was Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.

1. You can easily find photos of attack helicopters and other hardware that are Russian that have been destroyed in this conflict. That equipment is extremely expensive, sophisticated, and difficult to replace. Losing it is a significant blow.
2. Russia very clearly thought they would be inside Kyiv on day 1. They dropped elite paratroopers at the airport near Kyiv, with the obvious intention of securing a landing strip and air lifting equipment and troops into the capital. Ukrainian AA and a counter-attack prevented that from happening. Paratroopers are themselves very difficult to replace.
3. The morale blow from losing hundreds of troops, even if they are conscripts, is significant.
4. There have been historical military strategies that involved conscripts as cannon fodder and elite forces behind them - e.g. Roman legions tended to have this formation. Except in those cases the elites were DIRECTLY behind the conscripts. The point was that the enemy's front line would be physically tired when the elites pushed forward. This is not in any way comparable.
5. There are people watching. Every conflict is an advertisement for the equipment being used. This is embarrassing for Russian military manufacturers, and will hit their ability to sell equipment to other countries. It is also undermining Russia's ability to project military strength and intimidate or threaten neighbours.

It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II; the war ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway.

Training is also important.

There's no way Russia has enough money in their military budget to fly anywhere near that much on the regular, and if you immediately go into a major wartime flying schedule, your MC rate is going to drop as maintenance issues crop up faster than your ground crew can fix them until either your whole squadron is grounded, or you dial back the sortie rate to let maintenance catch up.",1645933247.0,1645933025.0,t3_t2eq8j,t1_hylluqi,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Them holding Russia back is horrible for Putin‚Äôs plans to expand further, which we have reason to believe he wants to. They are having a lot of trouble taking down a country with no international troops on the ground, with most of their military resources. This makes further expansion nigh impossible at this point.

They do not make enough food to supply their large population and would hurt their economy if they sided with a nearly broke world power that the rest of the world is ready to make a 3rd world country again. 

Knowing china and their ultimate goal of financial world domination, it also would be ill advised for them to have a broken up EU or damaged relations. They know people wish to move away from using them for manufacturing but siding with Russia and providing support would potential remove them from SWIFT which they don't have an alternative to yet, but are working on one to avoid situations exactly like this. 

Finally, they have big plans for taking territory of their own and I'm sure they wish to expand into Russia as well as take back ""their"" territory of Taiwan (it's an independent country, fight me). Putting themselves in a bad positiont that would upset pretty much the entire western world would not be beneficial for the gains they could potentially have. Not to mention that if Russia is economically ruined, they would have one less country to compete with for when they try taking over.

Rubio is there to counter Biden, if Biden ever does something bad secretly.

Similarly, the leading Democrat (Mark Warner) would be the official leaker if Trump did anything bad secretly.

-------

This isnt just a 'spies tell Senator's position. The Senators basically can ask for any top secret info they want, and almost certainly has the ability to decide whether or not it's worth declassifying.

> Cause hes chair

Was the chair. Mark Warner is now the chair because democrats have control.

Rubio had the chair when Republicans owned the Senate. But as lead Republican, Rubio is the #2 position on that elite committee.


-------

Honestly, I don't like it nor do I trust Rubio. If Mark Warner, the chair, were leaking this information is be more comfortable.

Rubio isn't the chair anymore, IMO he shouldn't be the one doing this. Biden is the official face of the USA.

According to Historian Alfred Mccoy, the west's influence-mostly economic and recently cultural- has been enough to stop anyone from controlling it. 
Russia has too much pride to play little brother to China, but sanctions could cripple them enough to force them to. Then China has enough influence to control the rest. It's important because it has a huge part of the human pop, 50+% of energy resources and a huge portion of land.

Where to even start? The dude's *coronation* killed 1300 people and he considered it an inconvenience about on par with the heat at the ball he attended that night.

>19th of May. Saturday. Until now, everything was going, thank God, like clockwork, but today there was a great mishap. The crowd staying overnight at Khodynka, awaiting the start of the distribution of lunch and mugs pushed against buildings and there was a terrible crush, and awful to say trampled around 1300 people!! I found out about it at 10+1‚ÅÑ2 hours before the report by [minister of war] Vannovski; a disgusting impression was left by this news. At 12+1‚ÅÑ2 we had lunch and then Alix [Czarina] and I went to Khodynka to be present at this sad ""national holiday."" Actually there was nothing going on: we looked from the pavilion at the huge crowd that surrounded the stage from which the orchestra played all the time the anthem and ""Glory."" Went to Petrovsky [palace], where at the gate I received several delegations and then entered the yard. Here dinner was served under four tents for all township heads. I had to make a speech, and then another for the assembled marshals of the nobility. After going around the table, we left for the Kremlin. Dinner at Mama's at 8. Went to the ball at [French ambassador] Montebello's. It was very nicely arranged, but the heat was unbearable. After dinner, left at 2. ‚Äî‚ÄâFrom the diary of Emperor Nicholas II

Then you have the pointless failed wars, the mass shootings of protestors...

The best you could say about him was that he genuinely loved his awful, awful wife.

>Queen Victoria worried about Alexandra's unpopularity in her new country, and she advised her granddaughter: ""I‚Äôve ruled more than 50 years ... and nevertheless every day I think about what I need to do to retain and strengthen the love of my subjects ... It is your first duty to win their love and respect."" Alexandra replied, ""You are mistaken, my dear grandmamma; Russia is not England. Here we do not need to earn the love of the people. The Russian people revere their Tsars as divine beings ... As far as Petersburg society is concerned, that is something which one may wholly disregard.""

FORTE11 has been monitoring these threads and identified several influence operations throughout the past 24 hours.  Influence operations are designed to passivize you, make you feel helpless (you‚Äôre not!) and drive public sentiment in support of an illegal military invasion.

Recent operations appear to include:

	1.	NATO/Generational/Political division comments (trump, biden, germany, boomers, gen-z, whatever)
	2.	‚ÄúWont someone think of the poor Russian soldier?‚Äù
	3.	‚ÄúNukes! Are we going to die from nukes now? I‚Äôm so afraid‚Äù  (Probably not)
	4.	‚ÄúGhOsT oF KyIv Is FaKe/Snake Island is alive, they surrendered!‚Äù (https://twitter.com/poroshenko/status/1497293195763408905)
	5.	Posting propaganda or bad takes as a question or as though you were arguing against them (e.g. My dad thinks Ukraine‚Ä¶)
	6.	‚ÄúRussias best forces are in reserve‚Äù
	7.	‚ÄúOMG thermobaric weapons are going to be used if we don‚Äôt give in to Putin‚Äù
	8.	‚ÄútHe cHeChEns aRe CoMiNg!1‚Äù
	9.	‚ÄúIf NATO and Russian forces touch/shootdown a plane/see each other, WW3 begins‚Äù (counterexample https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-air_combat_losses_between_the_Soviet_Union_and_the_United_States)
	10.	It seems like Gazprom suicide was 2014 (counter source welcome)

When Euromaiden happened, the pro-Russian regime in Ukraine was replaced by a pro-EU one, so Putin retaliated to that loss of control by taking Crimea and instigating a civil war in eastern Ukraine. Under Trump, sanctions (from when Russia took Crimea) against Putin were lifted and US support for Ukraine was weakened substantially.
  
When Trump lost the election, Putin presumably figured US support for Ukraine would increase again and decided if he didn‚Äôt do something decisive Ukraine would eventually become fully western-alligned.  
  
The thing that a lot of people don‚Äôt seem to realize is that the current situation in Ukraine is entirely of Putin‚Äôs own making. Before the taking of Crimea, Ukraine was pretty evenly divided between pro-Russia and pro-EU opinions. But when Putin annexed Crimea, and perhaps more importantly, helped instigate the seperatist breakaway in eastern Ukraine, the result was to galvanise the rest of the population against Russia. That 50/50 division between pro-Russia and pro-EU that used to exist in Ukraine has massively shifted away from Russia since 2014, to the point where the Ukrainian population is now overwhelmingly anti-Russia.
