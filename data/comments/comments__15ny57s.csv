*The United States has dramatically ramped up artillery shell production capacity since the start of Russia‚Äôs full-on invasion of Ukraine, Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon‚Äôs top spokesman, told reporters, including from The War Zone, Thursday. Production of 155mm artillery rounds went from 14,000 a month in February of 2022 to approximately 24,000 a month now, he said, adding that plans call for even greater increases.*

*‚ÄúCurrently, we plan to be at over 80,000 [155mm artillery shells] a month over the following year,‚Äù he said.*

*‚ÄúWe are having to establish entirely new production lines, for the metal parts, the actual shells themselves,‚Äù said Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology.*

*The Army is also investing in ‚Äúload, assemble and pack capacity, which is filling the shells with explosives, so they now become a functional weapon,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat capacity expansion is also underway at at least two locations.‚Äù*

*The final piece, he said, ‚Äúis bringing in additional production either overseas or domestically, for the propellant that actually shoots [the shells] out of the cannon.‚Äù*

>Facing a tsunami of disinformation about the treatment of Muslims that has in recent months fueled protests from Stockholm to Baghdad, Sweden decided it needed to fight back.

>It turned to the Psychological Defense Agency, a part of the Ministry of Defense that its government created last year. The agency has become the first line of defense for a country facing a sustained information attack from abroad.

>The country‚Äôs leaders are borrowing from an old Cold War strategy to steel the country‚Äôs 10 million people for the possibility of ‚Äútotal war‚Äù with the Soviet Union. Today‚Äôs main threat ‚Äî though not the only one ‚Äî is the Soviet Union‚Äôs successor state, Russia. According to the agency‚Äôs officials, the Kremlin has targeted Sweden with a concerted online campaign on social media and elsewhere to discredit the country and undermine its bid to join the NATO alliance.
>
>After working quietly behind the scenes, the agency has now explicitly accused Russia of exploiting recent protests by immigrants and others in Sweden that have included burning copies of the Quran, an act of desecration that is deeply offensive to Muslims. The outrage has already had an impact: delaying Sweden‚Äôs accession to NATO because of objections by another member, Turkey.

>
>A first group of six Ukrainian pilots is not expected to complete training on the U.S.-made F-16 before next summer, senior Ukrainian government and military officials said, following a series of delays by Western partners in implementing an instruction program for the sophisticated fighter jet.
>
>The timeline reflects the disconnect between Ukraine‚Äôs supporters, who envision F-16s as a key tool in the country‚Äôs long-term defense, and Kyiv, which has desperately requested that the jets reach the battle space as soon as possible, viewing them as critical for the current fight against occupying Russian forces.
>
>President Biden, after denying Ukrainian appeals for the F-16 for more than a year, reversed course in May and said he backed the idea of training Ukrainian pilots on the jets, and supported the transfer of the planes by other countries. Denmark and the Netherlands volunteered to lead a training effort, prompting hopes among officials in Kyiv that the planes would be defending Ukrainian airspace by as early as September.
>
>It was a familiar pattern for Ukraine and its chief military backer, the United States, which has repeatedly declined Ukrainian requests only to relent at a later date.
>
>But after the start of training was pushed back several times, Ukraine will now probably have to endure another year without the fighters, which officials in Kyiv have predicted would provide a significant military edge amid a slow-going counteroffensive and help better protect civilians against Russia‚Äôs regular missile and drone strikes.
>

Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines have said that low-flying Russian helicopters have been successful in attacking their ground forces in part because Ukraine is unable to threaten them in kind.
>

They describe the aircraft as a tool that, rather than altering the battlefield calculus in Ukraine‚Äôs current operation in the country‚Äôs east and south, will play a prominent role in Kyiv‚Äôs transformation into a well-armed regional power that can effectively deter Russia.

> According to a media report, the German government is examining how Germany can supply Ukraine with ""Taurus"" cruise missiles from Bundeswehr stocks in the coming months. According to ""Spiegel"" information, talks are underway between the Ministry of Defence and the arms industry.

> Minister Boris Pistorius' office has asked the ""Taurus"" manufacturer to limit the target programming of the air-to-surface cruise missile. Such a limitation of the system is quite possible, reports ""Der Spiegel"" with reference to industry circles. However, it would take several weeks.

> Chancellor Olaf Scholz wants to make a technical modification to rule out the possibility of Ukraine using the long-range weapon systems to carry out attacks on Russian territory. Scholz only wants to approve the ""Taurus"" delivery when he is convinced of the limitation, the report continues. However, he no longer has fundamental doubts about the idea.

I'm not sure this has been expressed enough but it would be a mistake to believe that peace is a negotiable thing. Peace is the ultimate goal and while in some particular cases negotiation can lead to a peaceful resolution of a problem.

The war in Ukraine is unfortunately not one of those case. Ukraine isn't going to give up on its people and Russia is visibly not going to give up on anything because they started it and there's no way back for them except total self-destruction (arguably it's hard to see a way out at this point for Russia that doesn't end in self destruction).

A peace deal in this context is just about making it more than obvious that this war can't be won by Russia that there can't be even an once of hope this will end well and will be all forgotten and making it impossible for Russia to start again in 10, 20, 50 years without burning itself the seconds they set the foot out of their borders.",False,1691787755.0,t3_15ny57s,t3_15ny57s,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

>  
>The sales, which are legal and unsanctioned, have raised alarms from nonproliferation experts and elected officials who say the imports are helping to bankroll the development of Moscow‚Äôs nuclear arsenal and are complicating efforts to curtail Russia‚Äôs war-making abilities. The dependence on Russian nuclear products ‚Äî used mostly to fuel civilian reactors ‚Äî leaves the U.S. and its allies open to energy shortages if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to cut off supplies. The challenge is likely to grow more intense as those nations seek to boost production of emissions-free electricity to combat climate change.

- Launch vehicle.  Some are launched from planes, some from one type of NATO ground vehicle, some from a different type, or even from some improvised technical thingy.

- Range.  Each has a listed range that's often limited by treaty, but since militaries always ignore treaties when it suits us it might have higher range.

- Payload.  Different explosion sizes make a big difference in what you target with it.  So does the explosion type - some are anti-personnel, some armor piercing, etc.

- Guidance.  This strongly affects how you can target it.  Many now just have GPS guidance, which is very strong but can be jammed.  Some have radar or thermal that allows targeting of specific vehicle types.  Some have proximity sensors to detonate right above the ground.

- Anti-anti-air capabilities.  Some juke, jam, fly really low, or etc.  This affects where you can send them without russia shooting them down.

- Cost and number available.  You want to use an expensive or a cheap tool for the right target, not the other way around.

- And there's probably more I'm missing.

ATACMS primary negative is because of the timing, and properties of its use, it's one of the weapons with the least inventory, and most on paper use in already existing defensive plans in places like Taiwan and SK.

Regardless of whether there is any F-16 training happening or not right now that is not true at all.

That Ukraine would receive HIMARS was announced at the start of June last year and was *claimed* to be delivered at the end of June. However it later came out they were operational in Ukraine *in early June.* Obviously training took place before the announcement they would even be given to Ukraine.

Then at the end of last summer it came out the US had been training, I think it was with 2,500 or 3,500 Ukrainians, *in the US* in various specialties, none of that was announced until after it happened. Same with training for HARM missiles since they didn't annoucned they were even giving them until after Russia found debris from one after a strike.

So we have the US training Ukrainians many times without it being annoucned and some of it definitely took place on US soil. So saying they've been ""straight up"" with training announcements is not accurate. That doesn't mean they're doing any F-16 training but you can't use their record of being upfront about it as evidence because it's not... it's obvious they don't announce training when it suits their purposes as they have many times already.

CAR investigators examined two Geran-2 UAVs that attacked Ukrainian positions in July 2023, and reached interesting conclusions. Firstly, Geran-2 UAVs have small-sized noise-immune Kometa receivers typical for all Russian high-precision products, designed to receive GLONASS signals. Secondly, unlike the Iranian version, in the Russian Geran-2, the antennas for receiving satellite data are located inside the drone, and not outside.

To name one, the Prayer Book Rebellion was directed at the Duke of Somerset, and almost nothing to do with the ailing Edward VI, despite the main causes being the actions of wealthy landowners, and the Reformation encroaching on our religious traditions, with the strong approval of Henry VIII and Edward VI.

Only the nobility had the ability to stand against the king and have any hope of a chance.

Do you doubt the compelled speech interpretation of the First Amendment? I can certainly cite some relevant cases.

Do you doubt the code is speech interpretation? Same. Let me know and I'll find some relevant cases for you.

Do you doubt Apple was ready to go to court over a similar case? Unfortunately that one didn't make it to court so there isn't relevant case law. It would seem the government found their own exploit (read:Bought one off a security researcher) but I can certainly point you to the stories about Apple getting ready to fight the case.

Governments fairly routinely make noise about moving to open platforms as a negotiating tactic to get a better deal from Microsoft. Since they generally don't make that move we have to assume some agreement was reached and Microsoft wouldn't be keen to give governments more reasons to leave them.
