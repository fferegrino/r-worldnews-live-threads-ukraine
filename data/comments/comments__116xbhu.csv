Day 361-362 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a pretty uneventful day with no missile strikes, but today Russians did try to launch some missiles from Belgorod, though this time it was pretty weird. First missile launches happened around 10:20pm and those were aimed at Kupiansk, locals reported hearing 2 explosions in the town. Then it was quiet for a bit, and at 11pm they started firing missiles again, but somewhat different this time.

They were launching a lot of missiles one after another and the vast majority of them were blowing up in the sky immediately after being launched. It’s hard to say if that was just air defense trying to shoot something down, because they use the same S-300 launchers for both hitting our cities and as air defense. They launched 11-12 missiles in the span of 20 minutes, but no explosions were reported anywhere. 

Though they did report at least 2 failed launches, so it’s safe to say that those missiles were used in ground attack mode. And I honestly doubt that they would use 12 AA missiles one after another to shoot something down. Usually, they launch 1-4 missiles when the missiles are used in air defense mode, not 12. One thing Russians did report is that after their missile launches there was a hit on a school in Shebekino, which honestly might have been done by one of their failed missile launches.

It was seriously hilarious seeing all the outrage in Russian channels about Biden visiting Kyiv. That was a complete meltdown, everyone was extremely angry and yelling to hit Kyiv with missiles immediately, while Biden was still there, to kill both him and Zelenskyy simultaneously. Many were even calling to hit Kyiv with a nuke. Are they really so stupid that they don’t understand the implications of intentionally killing the president of the US, and with a nuke no less?

**Background**

* The west has a history of colonialism, dictatorship, imperialism.
* Russia tried dialogue but the west continued to surround Russia with missile systems
* Putin's fantastical justifications for the military operations going all the way back to 2014, to protect people against Ukrainians and the West.
* Making it clear that *they* the west started the war, and Putin is trying to stop it.

**Complaining about Ukraine**

* The West has paid 150b dollars to support Ukraine, but neglect the poor countries (only paying 60b, and forcing them to submit to western will)
* 900,000 dead and millions of refugees from wars started by the west
* Just as the west rebuilt nazi Germany, they are trying to do the same in Ukraine, separating the country from ties to Russia
* The Ukrainians aren't even hiding that they get their imagery and insignias from Nazi Germany, use even image of Satan himself as a weapon against Russia
* Ukrainians have become hostages of their western masters, who rob and destroy their country, which is why moved in Donbas
* the West uses Ukrainians as cannon fodder

**Reaction**

* the existence of Russia is threatened by all this, targeting our young generation, lying, twisting history, information war against Russia
* west is destroying family values, abusing children, pedophilia announced as a normal thing in the west (lolwtf), while Russia doesn't enter private lives of people
* Anglican church considering gender neutral God
* western elites leading those nations to spiritual destruction, we must protest russian children from degradation
* We must be proud of being a multicultural nation, our people understand the meaning of the special military operation, support our actions
* Thanking all people of Russia for heroism, to everyone who is fighting this war, to wives and families, to builders, engineers, agricultural sector, teachers, etc
* Russia will continue social program, bring back factories and economics, create a new highway to Crimea; all regions of Russia providing direct support to these new regions, do everything to bring land back to peace and order
* Minute of silence for everyone who died in the action (lasted 6 seconds)

**Putin's Proposals**

* Russia has a duty to support everyone who has been negatively impacted by the war, need to respond to their needs quickly
* Putin proposes to create a special fund for families and people who died or were affected: medical, psychological support, education, entrepreneurship, veteran support, etc., and to bypass bureacracy to make this happen
* Expect all municipalities to continue supporting these projects and programs despite the fund
* Putin admits there are certain issues getting this help to those who need it and that these must and will be resolved

**Military Force for 2023-2025**

* There is an approved plan, this is of extreme importance
* The readiness of the nuclear force is 91%, but must make this level of readiness for all areas of the military
* Officers need to be trained and taught, and Russia needs to value their contribution
* Continue implementing the latest technologies to improve the quality - the tech is already there, but Russia must take this to mass production by mobilising more elements of the economy; everything needs to be done for the victory
* Putin proposes more protections for employees, and more securities for affordable housing, especially in cities which are important for weapons and engineering production

**Back to bitching about the West**

* The West has not acheived success in any of these areas. They are punishing themselves by sanctions: increased prices, collapsed energy sector, businesses failing.
* The West's objective is to force Russian citizens to suffer, destabilise society from within, but they are not successful.
* But Russia made it through despite it all this, thanks to the hard work of everyone in Russia. No printing money - everything done by simple market tactics.
* The West was forecasting total collapse, 20% GDP increase - all those predictions have failed; Russian economy stays strong, while the West continues to lose its status

**Russia's Internal Plan & How to Do It**

* Russia has everything it needs to continue to develop its economy; talking about how much housing and agricultural increase has happened
* The situation has changed for the better regarding the sustained development of Russia, despite any external threat: this isn't just a time of challenges, but also of opportunities
* Must remove any inter-governmental conflicts, stimulate small family business, new roads, schools, etc.
* Establish new international connections; new high-speed roads, ports, Volga-Caspian canal, modernise railways going to the East to develop the Siberian Far East
* Big change and modernisation to utilities, make it easier to launch industrial projects
* Tax structure and system has to be restructured and comprehensive; tax incentives for purchasing Russian-made technology
* Thanks to reserve, Russia doesn't rely on foreign investment; banks are stable",1676973613.0,1676970883.0,t3_116xbhu,t3_116xbhu,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

1. It only happened with Moscow's permission which makes them the alpha
2. Moscow allowed it to reveal how the West is the true enemy
3. Russia is having huge success with their offensive
4. Ukrainian victories in Vuhledar are ""unconfirmed""
5. The Pentagon and pro-Ukraine military experts like Ben Hodges thinks an Ukrainian offensive is a terrible idea.
6. Biden made the visit because Western support is at a breaking point and will fall in summer. That's why he is still pushing for an Ukrainian offensive
7. This offensive will fail because they have no equipment. It is a loser's last gamble.

It's interesting how these Western Vatniks are so much more detached from reality than their Russian counterparts. You only see this level of delusion from the state media itself. Also, will someone please tell Ben Hodges that he is against the offensive? It might surprise him.

Of course, when summer arrives and the Western support is still going strong a new reality will be spun up to explain it. Just like it have happened all the other times.",1676946433.0,1676946253.0,t3_116xbhu,t3_116xbhu,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

The fear is that they are trying to find a way to drive a wedge between the EU and America and the west and the south, not to mention warnings of China considering supplying munitions to Russia.  

I've noted various countries, and reporters, voicing scepticism towards Chinas idea of a peace process and it being light on details. It was nice to see some countries have been rather vocal about what they expect from a peace agreement, namely the removal of Russian troops.  

From what I've read it seems like China may try to use such a process as a wedge issue.  

I'm not suggesting this will work, but it is worth being aware of it as I have no doubt if it is of any use people will twist it further into propaganda and seed it in the media, etc.

Tbh, besides supporting Ukraine I would LOVE to see Putin fall and Russia break apart, just to see how many problem areas in Europe and around the world would suddenly be prone to actual resolve. Syria could get rid of its dictator. Moldova could return Transnistria and join NATO, same for Georgia with its ""seperatist"" areas. Chechnya could throw the yoke of the Kadyrovs and have a hope at a future as Ichkeria. Hungary would stand a chance at a more democratic development. Multiple conflict zones in Africa would lose the biggest primer for violence. Politics in the US would lose Russian influence. There is also a ton of smaller but extremist left and right political parties in Europe that would lose their black book funding. Their voices would be less prevalent and moderate politicians would get more air time....the total influence Russia has on the world is largely negative.

There was archival footage in a BBC documentary on the Soviet Union and Russia which showed heavily armed gangs blowing each other up and gunning each other down in public. There was footage of some out in the countryside doing target practice and blowing up a tree or log, something like that. It also mentioned in that documentary that some gangs were gunning each other down in a car plant. They'd come to steal cars off the assembly line and got involved in a fight with each other.  

The BBC documentary is made entirely of archival footage from that time.  
It's called Russia 1985–1999: TraumaZone What It Felt Like to Live Through The Collapse of Communism and Democracy.

I remember reading something about how the state would essentially allow the mob to extort army bases, which is a pretty astonishing statement. And Putin is arguably linked to the mob. 

So the army is kept weak and disrespected, and Putin has his vast personal home guard who aren't the army to counter them. So what about projecting force? This is where Wagner comes in: a smaller yet meaner and stronger private force that works, indirectly, for the FSB, or GRU I can't remember which. Which is also outside the law, which is convenient. Yet PMCs are illegal under Russia law! What do you do? Ignore the law, and I believe carve out an extension like, last year. Russia loves bureaucracy, even if they break all those laws they love. It's weird. 

So Prigozhin exists by the graces of the State intelligence agencies. He likes that. But for other reasons he can never be allowed to get too strong, lest he become a threat to the Putinists. I think he is being weakened, but has to accept whatever they give him. Instead of letting him get too big for his britches they will fund some other PMC, like, say Shoigu's. Let them get strong for a while and then get killed. 

You have to have a bunch of competing warlords fighting amongst themselves for a piece of the action, where any piece of the action gets the guy at the top super rich in the process. So with such a carrot they let the system continue because the big players always get paid, the only question is how much. 

So to answer your question, no, Prigozhin won't leave. I also think you are mistaking real traditional military values for prison gang values pretending to be something more than they are. I don't thin k he cares a rat's ass about any of his troops. But each and every one of them makes him richer. He wants them to win, of course, but probably because of a bonus structure based on results. That pays him.

Het afgelopen jaar beheerste de oorlog in Oekraïne het nieuws en de internationale politiek. En toch is de brutale invasie door Rusland maar een nieuwe, tragische episode in een lange geschiedenis van strijd die miljoenen levens eiste. Ook de afgelopen eeuw vochten generaties Oekraïners voor hun bestaan en vrijheid.  
  
Het verhaal begint vlak na de Eerste Wereldoorlog, wanneer een jonge Oekraïense staat wordt ingelijfd in Stalins Sovjet-Unie met honger en repressie tot gevolg. Na een vernietigende nazibezetting en decennia van Sovjetdictatuur lijkt Oekraïne begin jaren negentig zijn onafhankelijkheid terug te winnen, los van Moskou. Maar wanneer een groot deel van de Oekraïners met grootschalige opstanden in 2004 en 2013 ook een duidelijke Europese en Westerse koers verkiezen, grijpt de Russische president Vladimir Poetin steeds nadrukkelijker en genadelozer in...

Firstly, China has a peace plan they are pushing. There's a huge amount of scepticism and pushback from western leaders and reporters about it's lack of content so far. A theory is that China may try and use this plan as a wedge between the EU and America and also between the western nations and southern nations.  

Western nations have quickly responded that they're still committed, etc.  

As for southern nations, that's more difficult.  

China has a lot of sway over southern nations thanks to their Belt and Road plan. Some world leaders from the west have recently spoken to their southern counterparts and come away rather disappointed. The west wants their support in UN votes but it may be difficult getting any more votes than last time.  

Western leaders have been candid in the responses from the south regarding their failures in diplomacy regarding information sharing with the south and diplomats from the south have voiced the opinions that they have been ignored by the west, not treated as equals.  

One western leader mentioned that they should have done better in presenting information to the south that the grain shortages are due to Russia bombing the Ukrainian fields.  

That's a big problem for southern countries. They are short on money, food and fertiliser. Climate change is already effecting them too. One diplomat mentioned a country is having to subsidise the very expensive fertilisers for farmers.  

This is where China comes in again. China have been all too happy to invest in southern countries. A diplomat said that western companies have been pulling out or raising rates due to the global crises.  

China have been playing this investment game for a long time. That's given them a lot of sway over the southern countries who say they feel neglected and ignored by the west.  

I think part of this may be diplomats saying help us and we'll help you.  

That's about all I know, so you may wish to check out your favourite reputable news services and see what western leaders have said about their recent conversations with their southern counterparts.",False,1676924229.0,t3_116xbhu,t1_j9be09b,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

I guess that noticing Chinese weapons on the Ukrainian battlefield would be a dead giveaway that they are indeed supplying weapons to Russia.

A rival with rich resources and lands they could steal and exploit if Russia becomes weak enough. But a weak Russia means a weak ally agains't the West.

Xi is trying to play a balancing act. Keep Russia ''alive'' to keep the West distracted and keep a ''canon fodder'' ally; and preserve his prospects for Taiwan. On the other end, keep Russia weak enough so their eastern borders become more and more vulnerable to a porous Chinese immigration that's replacing the Russians over there. Keep Russia dependent on China, so China may use and exploit their desperation for cheap resources.

A lot of people seem to assume that Ukraine has this in the bag, because it has vastly overperformed, and Russia has vastly underperformed.

But Russia still has an extraordinary manpower, material and manufacturing advantage.

The situation is far from decided, and a large part of my fear is that as assumptions about Ukrainian totalist victory emerge, the means, the material supplied from the West, that could help secure that victory will become more and more lean.

Its interesting that a lot of estimates of a modern conventional war are coming true. That a lot of advance fighting systems would attrite quite quickly and that the result would be a rapid tech-downgrading. T90s all blown up or abandoned? Time to roll out the T64 that your granddad paraded in.

The implications of that are in your words, and somehow so understated, horrific. Truly horror inspiring.

I support the degradation and destruction of Russia's imperialist objectives, and the denial of *their ability to inflict further horrendous atrocities. But I fear that we are so unclear on just how undecided this conflict still is. And how much more horror will yet be inflicted.

When Russian bot gangmasters carried this over to the Ukrainian language sphere, they did not realise that Ukrainian has two different words - Ukrainian for ""cotton"" is ""bavovna"" (presumably a distant relative to German ""Baumwolle"").

We know Putin is paranoid. In his mind the Cold War never ended. He sees the fall of the Soviet Union as a time of great shame. He's still fighting the Cold War regardless of what the rest of the world thinks.  

Putin sees conspiracies everywhere whenever something goes wrong for him. In his mind it is America and the CIA trying to topple him. He sees democracy as a tool used by America to topple dictators. He's afraid of what happened to Saddam and Gaddafi may happen to him.  

So it's no surprise that during the Euromaidan protests when Clinton voiced her support for the protesters and democracy that Putin saw this as confirming his paranoid beliefs, namely that America and the CIA were trying to topple him and control Ukraine. This is one of the most important reasons why Putin wanted absolutely *anyone* as president of America but Clinton.  

We may not like it or agree with his paranoid KGB reasoning, we may even hate it, but that doesn't change the fact that this is how Putin actually thinks.

Boris Berezovsky told Litvinenko to brief his Uzbek file about corrupt FSB officers to the future Head of the FSB Putin which Litvinenko did on 25 July 1998 and, later, Litvinenko was imprisoned.[81][82] Robert Eringer, head of Monaco's Security Service, confirmed Litvinenko's file about Vladimir Putin as a kingpin in Europe's narcotics trade.[83] The Colombia-based Cali KGB Cartel supplied cocaine to this network, too  

I'll requote a tiny part of that again, just to highlight it:

Ukraine are using certain items more than are being produced, 155 mm artillery shells are often mentioned, but Russia has the same problem with artillery with the amount of shells they've fired per day going down over time. Sure not great if you could use more than you have but it's a prime example of Russia having the same issue Ukraine does, limited supply of something they'd like to have more of.

For Ukraine when it comes to something like rifle ammunition there is little sign that's an issue, ditto for Russia, they don't seem to be running out of bullets to shoot. Grenades and RPG's seem in decent supply for both as well. Ukraine is fine for fuel and if there is one thing Russia isn't going to run out of it's oil and gas of course. Is Ukraine really short of ATGM's like Stugna, NLAW and Javelin? It doesn't seem like it but it's tough to tell, Russia still seems to have decent stocks as well, they're certainly still using them at any rate.

Ukraine has an edge in personal protective equipment like body armor, med kits and uniforms because they can tap the immense supply network of NATO existing stock and newly manufactured items as well. And here is where it's obvious to see Ukraine actually has a huge advantage overall in it's supply situation is access to manufactures all over the world none of which are under crippling sanctions like Russia is. For instance plans have been put in place to drastically increase 155 mm shell production in the west, can Russia match that? Who knows.

Obviously Ukraine still need donor nations to keep helping but there doesn't seem to be much sign that is slowly down, in fact the last couple months with the supply of hundreds of infantry fighting vehicles and now, hopefully, hundreds of tanks they're getting more aid not less. Russia is refurbing a lot of older tanks and IFV's from storage, are they meeting the numbers the army wants? Hard to know really, we still see Russian armored vehicles but that kind of comparison is tough to make since we don't really know how many armored vehicles each side has and how many they could operate if they had them.

Anyway the list of items you could compare is endless but my point is you can't really make such a broad statement when we're talking about the complex web of industry that supplies a modern army.

So while there are certainly some items that are bottlenecks for Ukraine saying they'll ""run out before Russia"" does is a vast oversimplification when we're talking about all the the equipment and supplies a military needs to fight and in fact ignores that sanctions on Russia have hugely impacted it's manufacturing sector. It hasn't stopped it sure, and the Russians are adjusting, but it's clear that Russia's war effort is struggling partially due to it's military industrial complex not being able to supply everything it needs. Ukraine doesn't get everything it needs either but at least it can tap so many other nations supply networks that haven't had their industry handcuffed like Russia's has been.",False,1676962265.0,t3_116xbhu,t1_j9e3x86,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

In fact, because the Kremlin didn't control the Russian media back then many mothers went to the front line and begged their young boys to come home with them. In the BBC documentary TraumaZone it showed archival footage of that happening. One young man did go home with his mother. He hid his grenades behind a tree or bush on the side of a road.  

If you follow some of the links in that Chechen war article you'll read about how the Russians hid behind civilians, how they seized a hospital and used it as a base.

Pull up a map. Ukraine falls, Moldova is the next country over. Government has admitted it can't fight Russia. What's the next country after Moldova?
