* Over the last 48 hours, heavy fighting has continued in the Bakhmut sector where Ukrainian forces are keeping resupply routes open to the west despite Russia‚Äôs creeping encirclement over the last six weeks.  

* Further south in Donetsk Oblast, the town of Vuhledar has again experienced heavy shelling. There is a realistic possibility that Russia is preparing for another offensive effort in this area despite costly failed attacks in early February and late 2022.  

* Russia‚Äôs Eastern Group of Forces likely still has responsibility for the Vuhledar operation.  

* Its commander, Colonel General Rustam Muradov, is likely under intense pressure to improve results following harsh criticism from the Russian nationalist community after previous setbacks.  

* However, it is unlikely that Muradov has a striking force capable of achieving a breakthrough.

>2. RIA Novosti news agency accidentally published an article, tagged with a publication date of 8 AM on February 26, already celebrating a Russian victory and the collapse of the Ukrainian state within an anticipated two days. It's still on their site.
>
>3. The central theme is that the ""operation"" is a defeat for the West's project to defeat Russia. Putin seized the moment to return Ukraine to its historic Slavic union with Russia and Belarus. Potential NATO candidacy is seen as a symptom of the problem, not the leading cause.
>
>6. Putin, we are told, had to act now or lose Ukraine forever. 
""We can say without a drop of exaggeration that Vladimir Putin took upon himself a historical responsibility by deciding not to leave the resolution of the Ukrainian question to future generations.""
>
>7. The main issue was ""the complex of a divided nation and a complex of national humiliation when the Russian House began to lose part of its foundation (the Kievan one) and then was forced to reconcile itself to the existence of two states of not one but two peoples.""
>
>8. The answer? Kill Ukraine's sovereignty. ""Now this problem no longer exists: Ukraine has returned to Russia. This doesn't mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be re-structured, re-established, and returned to its natural condition as part of the Russian world‚Ä¶
>
>10. The author moves to the West. ""Did anyone in... Paris and Berlin seriously believe that Moscow would give up [Kyiv]?‚Ä¶ the West as a whole, and  Europe in particular, lacked the strength to keep Ukraine within its sphere of influence, let alone to take Ukraine for itself.""
>
>16. ""the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well: this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia recovering its historical space and place in the world.""
>
>19. A few final comments. This is a Russian imperialist discourse: rejected at the end of the USSR, given respectability again under Putin in 2000 but still marginal. It entered Putin‚Äôs public speeches after the seizure of Crimea‚Äî and now has entirely captured Putin‚Äôs world-view.
>
>20. Much of the Russian foreign establishment is anti-Western to various degrees but not nearly this aggressive (which is why most of them did not predict the invasion). But their views mean little when Putin makes all the decisions.
>
>21. The author gives no agency to Ukrainians as people. He twists himself in a knot asserting that ‚Äúbrothers still shoot at each other, even though they have been divided only by their membership of the Russian and the Ukrainian armies.‚Äù It's regrettable fratricide, folks.
>
>22. He magnifies differences between the West over Russia into significant splits. Germany's historical reaction to events now answers that. Like most imperialists, he fails to understand how small countries, from the Baltic States in 1940 to Czechoslovakia in 1968, feel about big neighbors.
>
>23. The author gets it wrong, anticipating Ukraine‚Äôs collapse and European disunity. Thank the Lord! But there's less to cheer about elsewhere. Given the equivocation of China, India, and Turkey's limited response, the bet that only the West cares about Ukraine still has to be disproved.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary force, said on Thursday that much-needed ammunition for his troops had been dispatched, after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason.

Prigozhin had on Wednesday published a grisly image of dozens of men who he said had been killed because commanders including Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov had withheld ammunition to spite him. Neither man commented but the ministry rejected the charge.

In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the Defence Ministry had paid off, and that he had been told ammunition was now on its way.

""So far, it's all on paper but, so we have been told, the principal documents have already been signed,"" said Prigozhin.

I'm nosy and curious and generally amazed by the way tech allows us to see what we once couldn't. In the case of a year ago, that was a live feed of a street in Kiev, where a young woman, maybe a model, was doing a small photo shoot. I watched for a while - a few people wandered the streets, all was calm and quiet and normal-looking, and this happy young woman was posing for photos for some time. At one point, a stray cat came up to her, and she spent time enjoying his presence before she was back to her photos. 

I think of her a lot. I wonder where and how she ended up in all this. I remember thinking I might be getting screenshots of a last happy calm night there, before things might kick off as horribly as they were rumored to, and sat there as a stranger from a different country secretly but fervently wishing her the best.

Now, it's possible that Putin will try to push for a big aerial campaign pretty soon but the big issue for him is that Ukraine air defense vastly improved since the start of the conflict and so this could end up in a disaster for russian airforce. 

The thing is, we already witnessed russian army attempting dumb strategies, so I wouldn't be surprised if they really try to a push with a type of attack they couldn't do 1 year ago, despite the surprise factor and the lack of air defense in Ukraine.

Russia is actually going to attack (sabotage raids) Ukraine from Transnistria, and the false flag claim is an preamptive cover up for what Russia will do themselves. It will also justify further investment in the area as well appealing to the national pride. Full scale invasion is pretty much impossible from Transnistria.

The proposal does not hold Ukraine accountable for its role in negotiating a lasting peace; rather, the bill, which overwhelmingly passed, inflames tensions by inappropriately placing the burden of peace on Russia while disregarding their security concerns.

They're also bitter the bad faith Belarus amendments were not passed, thus, the assembly is not really interested in peace.

Clarke says the coup will be carried out by people closest to Putin.

For example, military officials: ‚ÄúSooner orlater they will want to remove Putin from his position, I am sure.

It's just not clear when. But this coup will bring down Putin,"" Clarke said.Earlier, Putin's former speech writer,Abbas Gallyamov, also predicted a coup in conversation with CNN.

As Russian losses in Ukraine mount and the country experiences hardships from Western sanctions, the Russians will look for someone to blame, Gallyamov stressed.

The Russian economy is deteriorating. In fact, the war is already lost.

These risks arise from humans intentionally using the LLM (large Language Models - Ex. Chat GPT) to cause
harm, for example via targeted disinformation campaigns, fraud, or malware. Malicious use risks are expected to proliferate as LLMs become more widely accessible. As one paper concluded, it is difficult to scope all possible (mis-)uses of LLMs . Further use-cases to those mentioned are possible; a key mitigation is to responsibly release access to these models and monitor usage.

Was contemplating this a long while ago. What exactly would Russia strike? A small nuclear bomb would do relatively little and yet stoke the west almost as much as a big nuclear bomb would do, as such if you're going to do it it feels like you need to go 'all-in'.

Do you bomb a city? Lots of civilian deaths, worldwide ire, you probably lose more than you gain in the long run.

A military camp? I doubt any single military facility is worth a nuclear bomb - and you'd still get worldwide ire.

Try and kill Zelenskyy? Is a nuclear bomb worth one man? Is it worth the western aid that would pour in?

In any scenario you may even lose backing from your few 'allies' such as China.

Most people here disagreed with me, arguing that Ukraine ought to keep up the momentum and keep conducting offensives until the last Russian soldier ran for the border. 

I did not think it could go that way. Unless an army has overwhelming force, it can‚Äôt simply keep conducting offensives or it will grind itself down and leave it open to a devastating counter-offensive. Only military fools indulge themselves like that ‚Ä¶ which is why Russia seems to have no other strategy. 

The Ukrainians, on the other hand, have been fighting cleverly - they have no other choice, if they want to win. Their counter-attacks have been limited and effective, they have avoided over-extending themselves. They let Russia grind its army down with blunt offensives against prepared positions, maybe gradually losing minor territory (and admittedly suffering themselves, albeit to a much lesser degree). Then, when the Russian army is weak, the morale of its troops at a low ebb, and Ukrainian forces concentrated - they will strike.

They get called bandits and pirates and worse because they charge ‚Äòpassage-fees‚Äô to travelers who cross the Sahara, just like every country does if you travel through, but they do it informally at the point of contact, and they don‚Äôt have a government, so it‚Äôs a crime.



I‚Äôve been ‚Äòtaxed‚Äô by Tuaregs a few times. As long as you‚Äôre not a dick about it, they‚Äôll take a little, make sure that you have enough water, and be on their way. If you are a dick about it, they very well may not.



The Tuaregs are almost universally hated by the majority populations in every country that they are present, especially Mali.



The French know the Tuareg very well. When a former French colony, like Mali, wants something done about Tuareg ‚Äòbanditry‚Äô, they usually turn to the French. The French try, they bring in soldiers, but also translators and negotiators and aid workers. The French have tried the scorched-earth approach, and failed, before. Scorched-earth is where these people live. They‚Äôre used to it.



Recently, the government of Mali lost patience, and wants the Tuareg genocided, so they kicked out the French and brought in the genocide specialists.



But the Tuareg roam over vast areas across quite a few countries. It won‚Äôt work. They‚Äôll move deeper in to the desert and wait it out.",False,1677193254.0,t3_119odof,t1_j9qusn4,,1,33,0,33,0,0,

I watched almost all of Maidan. I watched a peaceful pro-western rally in Odesa get attacked by provocateurs. They even shot into the crowd. I watched the crowd go mad with rage and chase them to the Trades Union building, where it became apparent the provocateurs had planned for violence. They were besieged by the protesters, *then they themselves livestreamed from the inside where they had gasoline and bottles prepared and started making Molotov's. A lot of Molotov's*. They ended up throwing molotovs's out at the protesters and ofc, because **they're always fucking stupid** managed to somehow torch themselves. A lot died in the fire.

&nbsp;

I also watched ""Green men"" taking over a Ukrainian military airfield in Crimea. The Ukrainian airmen had refused to surrender and were given a deadline. They did not have orders (government in disarray after Yanukowich fled) and not really weapons to defend themselves, but refused to leave. In the end the Russian troops came up to the entrance to go in and take the Ukrainian soldiers prisoner. Therw was a webcam sat on the lightpole at the entrance, where we could watch. The Russian commander clearly wanted no evidence, so he took out his sidearm and shot a full clip at the camera. Missed. New clip, grazed the camera so screen fractured a bit, still worked. Third magazine he managed to shoot the camera loose from the pole. But the thing was connected by wire, so it fell and got arrested by the wire, so it hung upside down, **still showing the entrance**. After a while someone came and told him that the camera was still operational, so he sent a soldier up the pole. Fell down twice before he managed to knock it down with his rifle.

&nbsp;


EDIT;

&nbsp;

So no, I'm not suprised at how dumb the Russian military, or intelligence or command is. I am impressed with the world we live in yes.

&nbsp;

I've held my eye on Ukraine ever since. It sounds so cliche to say it. But I knew Ukraine was rotating as many troops as possible training as many lower officers as possible at the Donbas frontlines to get them used to being in the line of fire. To prepare positions to be proteced from arty, to perfection squad operation, command and control and to study the Russian MO. I knew they were enthusiastically taking in what Western trainers had to teach, that they were working hard on their weapons industry. I watched hundreds of interviews and reports, i saw the mood and the attitude to Russia change even in the far eastern parts that were not occupied. I saw all of that.

&nbsp;

So I knew back in February (and I guess thats what everyone would say now)...but I knew the Ukrainians were never going to take this one sitting down. Never in a million years. Personally I anticipated half a year or so of military resistance by the armed forces, then a guerilla war until Russia was broken. 5-10 years perhaps. So even seeing how hard they were going to fight, I didn't think it could go like this. Because back in 2014, no one helped them. Western countries left them stranded imho. Understandable, because when Crimea happened it wasnt even quite clear who had control of the armed forces...but still. They were let down by us, and I had come to believe the same would occur again. Imagine my joy when the arms started pouring in. And no, even having watched this long, I could not have imagined in my wildest dreams **how fucking talentless Russian planning and execution is**. And thank God for that.

&nbsp;

Second Edit;

I also want to say that in my own modest ways I have some connections. I know now that what is being planned at least in my country for Ukraine is a very long term aid. Ukraine will not be left to fend for itself this time. There is real and genuine and quite colossal planning to help Ukraine rebuild. I will personally go there to celebrate their victory, and I plan to spend multiple holidays there, because tourist money will be needed too.
 I have considered multiple times going to fight. But I do not have the health for it, although I do have both the experience and the will. I would simply be a liability. It was the first question my wife asked me the day the invasion started; ""Are you thinking about going?"". 

My reply was ""Yeah. But I think it would be a problem when I had to ask everyone to pause the fighting for an hour or so, because ""My MS Fatigue is acting up, I need a quick rest""",1677183707.0,1677181742.0,t3_119odof,t1_j9q2s48,,1,33,0,33,1,0,{'gid_3': 1}

If they lose that, it would be an extremely high visibility failure that would taint Putin's legitimacy; the war becomes an unsellable debacle and he could lose power. Russia would become vulnerable and their ability to project power to other places in the world would be greatly diminished. However, if Russia were to take out key AA and achieve air superiority, they would probably quickly win this war.

A Russian air assault victory would allow them to destroy the flow of Western equipment into the country. More importantly, they could destroy all the bridges along the Dnipro river, cutting the country in two, and isolating basically the bulk of Ukraine's army in the east, cut off from supplies. Ukraine would basically be screwed.

The main thing that's stopping that is there is no scenario were Russia could do that and not have its air force badly mauled. It is basically the cannon fodder zerg rush with billions of dollars of equipment instead of untrained conscripts. No scenario where the losses wouldn't be catastrophic for Russia. But would Putin risk it if he thinks he'll ""only"" lose 50% of his Air Force? Especially if it's to an end a war that he otherwise thinks he has no way of winning?

I think the thing that is probably stopping Russia is Putin being wary and conservative with these plays after all the catastrophic defeats and meltdowns. Even if this generals are telling him they could do this and it would work, and even if they were correct, how could he possibly believe them at this point? He could easily make a fatal mistake that cripples Russia for a generatrion that no amount of propaganda could cover up. ...and every day he stays from playing it, it is that much less likely to succeed.

> I still dont know how Russia economy hasn't completely fallen apart yet. Or maybe it has, its just we wont find out until someone actually audits the books.

From my understanding, Russia is currently burning through their reserves. It's like having little to no income but spending as much as you were when money was flowing. You'll be able to live a remarkably long time like that. 

See, Russia can save money by not investing in infrastructures so instead of doing routine repair... they'll just take all the time until something breaks to repair it. People in Russia are used to that. So all the Russian government has to do is to keep things quiet and nobody will complain too much because expectations are already low.

But depending on how things are evolving, I'd say Russia is playing a race game. It's just a matter of how long they can keep up with this war and how strong the upcoming Ukrainian counter operation will be.

But what I do expect is that one day, the check will bounce because the reserves are depleted and they can't pay every dead soldiers...And suddenly it will all fall apart spectacularly.",False,1677186924.0,t3_119odof,t1_j9qabkn,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

I have a few core (and some cynical) thoughts.

1. They've moved as fast as they could as an alliance so all partners continued to be on board and could contribute. Moderately confident to be true. IMO the true reason, thus number 1.

2. They've moved as fast as they thought possible without escalating. Escalation being their primary concern. Also moderately confident to be true but also logically stupid (if intent is to evict Russia quickly). Cooking the frog slowly in oil just keeps the frog in the oil. But also benefits the Allies, Russia is permanently weakened, now the contention with CCP is more manageable should the worst occur.

3. They've moved as fast as they could to set up lines of supply, training and sustainment. 1. and 2. could potentially be cover for 3. US can supply a lot and continually, but can rail to Ukraine keep up? Can the people be trained quickly enough? etc. etc.

4. They've moved as fast as is possible while it gives time for military industry and procurement to spin up with public support, so that in the current and potential future wars, military spending and industry is where it needs to be. Keep in mind many allied leaders are pragmatic and support the Allies but domestic support for increased military spending is hard off the back of COVID and inflationary issues. This war provides perfect cover to reinvigorate militaries, tech and industry.

Any and all are possible. Hell number 2. could be split into 'escalation' and 'degradation' points.

Either way, we see what we can see with open source, all we know is that things behind the scenes are complicated. I just hope we send more and more to Ukraine so they can expel Russia from their lands... For good.",1677141419.0,1677140892.0,t3_119odof,t1_j9nl2jk,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

A platoon is commanded by a lieutenant, and in US Army has ~36 people per platoon (I assume that the Ukrainians are somewhat similar, but I don't really know). So the size / scale of this fight is extremely small in the great scheme of things... but genius ideas like this are what put the Ukrainians ahead of the Russians.

Russian forces aren't allowed to innovate like this. These are the kinds of ideas that can only be generated at the platoon or smaller sizes: noticing that a hill over there is just the right cover to do something that higher-level commanders wouldn't recognize (if you're commanding 200+ troops or 500+ troops, you don't have the time to check every hill, tree, or crevasse for ideas like this)

But the Russians are demoralized. Their smart commanders are staying away from the front. The troops at the front didn't even complete basic training, let alone know how to ""run the math"" on mortar fire responses vs firing rates of the Mk. 19 grenade launcher.

Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia - thanks for trusting us when nobody else did; we shared a long period of suppression and occupation by our common foe and you certainly know who is who; you donated your yearly budgets to help us fight that enemy.

Bulgaria, Romania - thank you for hosting our people and providing shelters to them.

France - thank you for Ceasars and for support; we know you tried to manage to explain to Khuilo why it is a bad idea to invade Ukraine.

Danmark, Sweden and Norway - thank you for your understanding of a human being's life value. Thank you for timely and effective help.

Italy, Spain - you are warm countries with warm hearts, and we are sending you warm words for aiding us.

Germany - thank you for funding a lot of efforts benefiting Ukraine's defensive capabilities.

Japan, Australia - you are so far away geographically but at the same time so close mentally; thank you for helping us protect the humanity.

Canada - thank you for your continued help to Ukraine that has been lasting for over a century: you welcomed our people in the beginning of the 20th century and gave them shelters and jobs and you are doing it now; thank you for your support.
 
UK - thank you for being pioneers of military aid to us; you were those who exemplary unlocked supplies of heavy stuff to Ukraine that helped us better protect our country.

USA - thank you buddies! There are simply not enough words to express our gratitude for everything you've done, are doing and will do for us; after our victory you know who is going to be one of your closest allies.

The scholarly consensus holds that they were originally Norsemen, mainly originating from present-day Sweden, who settled and ruled along the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black Seas from around the 8th to 11th centuries AD. In the 9th century, they formed the state of Kievan Rus π, where the ruling Norsemen along with local Finnic tribes gradually assimilated into the East Slavic population, with Old East Slavic becoming the common spoken language. Old Norse remained familiar to the elite until their complete assimilation by the second half of the 11th century, and in rural areas, vestiges of Norse culture persisted as late as the 14th and early 15th centuries, particularly in the north.

Everyone's been talking about giving Ukraine the F-16 or the Eurofighter, but the Tornado would also enable Ukraine to use modern weapons systems, and is still a combat aircraft in active service with NATO member nations (Germany and Italy, specifically, are current users, but the UK only retired their Tornado fleet a couple of years ago and I'm not convinced they're all scrapped by this point).

Tornado might not be a particularly modern aircraft (read: stealthy as a brick), but is still a very capable weapons platform (Enhanced Paveway, JDAM, Taurus, Storm Shadow, Brimstone, etc. etc.) and is designed for very low-level operations.

EDIT:  I know it takes a lot of work and training - not just for pilots, but for ground crews and logistics teams - to operate a new aircraft type.  I don't seriously think anyone's going to give their Tornados to Ukraine, it would make more sense for them to receive F-16 or Eurofighter.

General Mark Hertling explained the problem. Abrams engines are so complicated and huge that you can't repair them in the field. When an Abrams engine gives out, you need a crane to pull it out of the tank and a truck to take the engine back to base. You also need a second truck to pull up to the empty chassis and put in a new replacement engine. On top of that, they guzzle much more fuel than lighter tanks like the Leopard 2 and T-72. A single Abrams tank battalion likely requires over a hundred extra trucks just to service those two to three dozen tanks.

Those are hundreds of trucks, thousands of tons of fuel, and thousands of personnel that can't be used in more important ways for the war if they are wasted on a few dozen Abrams. Lighter, easier-to-service tanks are better for Ukraine because there's just nothing especially worthwhile about the Abrams for a fast-speed offensive. Abrams are just as destructible in this war as any other tank -- they have no better top-armor than any other tank when they get hit with an AT missile, and they have no better bottom armor or track system when they run over a mine.

>Maclean‚Äôs spoke to Dr. Eric Ouellet, a professor at the Royal Military College‚Äôs Department of Defense Studies in Toronto and an expert on insurgencies. Ouellet broke down what might be in store for the Russians and why, if Putin is at all rational, he should avoid it at all costs.  
>  
>Q: Why do you think a Ukrainian insurgency will be so costly for the Russians?  
>  
>A: Well, the best way to understand what the Russians face is to look at what makes an insurgency successful. There are three main ingredients. One is legitimacy. The insurgent force has to be seen as legitimate by the population. That way they get all the logistics support they need‚Äîhiding weapons, hiding people, helping with transportation, money, recruits, etc. So that‚Äôs one aspect that makes Ukraine very strong from the get go.  
>  
>The second characteristic is the insurgency‚Äôs actual capacity to inflict damage. In Ukraine, they have a very high level because of the military training they have received from countries like Canada, as well as the fighting in the Donbas region, where you have had independent Ukrainian battalions made up of volunteers. These people are still around, and they have real military experience.  
>  
>The last characteristic of a successful insurgency is external support. Again, Ukraine is really starting at a very high level. The international community has shown that it is ready to back a long-term insurgency.All the pieces are in place. If the Russians try to go all the way‚Äìtake Kyiv and Kharkiv and the rest of the country‚Äìand put a puppet government in place, that government will have zero legitimacy; it will face a very well-organized insurgency that has deep support.  
>  
>They‚Äôre going to be in big trouble. The problem with an urban insurgency is that you have a fairly high density of people. It‚Äôs very easy to hide in the population. And the only way to really fight against that effectively is to have well-established security and intelligence services to figure out who‚Äôs who. In a country where nobody wants to work with you, it‚Äôs going to be difficult, it will take a while to establish those resources. Even if you install a friendly government, it takes time for it to put in place loyal security services.  
>  
>Before those services can start functioning efficiently, the Russians will have to rely on brute force, which brings us to a key dynamic in insurgencies: the spiral of oppression and legitimacy. In the face of a strong and determined insurgency, a Russian occupation will be needed for a long time, which will lead to further oppression and, knowing Putin, war crimes.

And second, the structures are set up so there‚Äôs never interagency cooperation, an entire project is wholly helmed by one department; thus, there‚Äôs no professional friendship basically and no reason, for example for one pillar to know what a different pillar is doing/thinking.  So would have to broach, feel out, and it would be interrupted before could get any sort of conspiracy off the ground. 

Mishustin would be monitored if he spoke to Elvira, basically.

So there's thousands of tanks still in reserve. Well, which models? How good of shape are they in? I could have a rusted out hulk still on the books but it's not going anywhere any time soon. 

If they still had an endless supply of decent armor showing up I'd say those reserves are real numbers. But they're rolling out worse and worse armor and are raiding museums so it raises the question of how many of those paper forces only exist on paper. 

It's reading tea leaves and basically speculation at this point. One thing mentioned with arty is you have to replace the barrels every so many rounds and they're having trouble manufacturing spares. So you could strip existing batteries of barrels to feed to the front but there's only so many parts to strip. 

One thing that I think is telling is they're running these forces out piecemeal it seems. Standard doctrine is to amass an insurmountable concentration of forces to hit the enemy line and break through but they're coming in dribs and drabs. So they're either too stupid to concentrate the power or are ordered by command to attack before they have the concentration or are incapable of making the concentration. 

I'm no military expert but if I were wanting to make a big assault, my first order of business would be to hold the line and not waste my forces while building up for that assault. There might be some wisdom in mounting harassing attacks to keep the Ukrainians off-balance but I shouldn't be losing significant numbers there because I need them for the assault. And my assault should be of sufficient power to break through the lines of defense into their rear so I can gobble up significant territory before taking an operational pause to regroup. 

The Russians aren't doing that. But that looks pretty much like exactly what Ukraine did in that last big grab. And I have to wonder how their next counter-offensive is shaping up. What it sure looks like is the boxer who's turtling up, gloves over his face, letting his opponent rain a series of ineffective blows and getting tired before he drops the gloves and punches back.",False,1677177362.0,t3_119odof,t1_j9prh50,,5,0,0,0,0,0,
629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,119odof,j9r972h,"Ultra front-armored tanks incur increasingly little tactical advantage these days. They are designed for massive open plain tank battles - a defensive operation against hordes of literally thousands of tanks once fielded by the Soviet Union. American engineers anticipated that Western tanks would be heavily outnumbered, so they were designed to take as many hits from the front as possible and to shoot to kill the enemy from as far away and as accurately as possible.

They worked wonderfully in Iraq both times, because their battlefield was open desert, which made their superior targeting optics and computerized fire control a dream come true. However, even in Iraq it was obvious the Abrams was not ideal for the conditions. The Abrams is slower than other tanks, more fuel-intensive, and just as vulnerable to IEDs as anything else. Kill rates against enemy Soviet-designed tanks were phenomenal, and crew survivability was virtually perfect. However, they were prone to breaking down and getting disabled. Lighter anti-infantry vehicles like the Bradley actually killed more enemy tanks than the Abrams.

The disadvantages of the Abrams are all worse in Ukraine. Unlike other tanks, they are literally too heavy, tonnage-wise, to safely cross most Ukrainian bridges. They have not adapted to deal with ambush AT missiles that fire liquid jets vertically down through the weak top-turret armor. They have better optics, but that's not going to result in very many Russian tank kills because neither side in this war is bunching up their tanks like in Iraq anymore. Russian tanks are very dispersed. It's rare they attack or defend with more than ten of them in the same area.

The Abrams primary threat in this war are the same three threats that all other tanks face. In order, the worst threats are artillery, mines, and AT launchers. If a grad rocket or 152mm shell lands next to an Abrams, the tank dies. If it runs over a mine, the tank dies. If a Russian wire-guided missile donates overhead, the tank dies. The Abrams has a much safer munition storage feature for its turret, which tends to save lives, but the tanks themselves will be toast. 

So far in this war, artillery alone is responsible for more than half of all tank kills on both sides. This is because mines limit the paths tanks can take when they assault a target. The tanks have to slowly pick their way through a mine field as they clear the way, or they have to take a pre-sighted path down a road. In both situations, the tanks get lit up with artillery. Ukraine has lost hundreds of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to this problem. The Abrams will not solve it - not by itself, anyway.

In American war doctrine, our tanks don't have this problem. Air supremacy means that all enemy artillery gets suppressed or destroyed with minutes of opening up. No such luck for Ukraine. In addition, American armor now comes with smart anti-projectile systems, which literally shoot enemy missiles and shells as they approach the tank. Ukraine won't have the benefit of that cutting-edge tech.

The optics and speed are the best two components for Ukraine, but they can get those much more cheaply and quickly with Leopards and especially lighter tank-alternatives like the French RMX, American Bradley and Stryker, and the German Marder.",False,1677197141.0,t3_119odof,t1_j9r6j8u,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

A longer convoy also means the whole unit is going slower. More vehicles to get disabled, lost, stuck, caught in shellings and traps, and repaired.
