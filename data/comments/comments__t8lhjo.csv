2. Russia renounces its imperialistic mentality and vows not to engage in wars other than for self defence (japanesse and german model). The population of Russia must learn about the horrors of Russian imperialism especially in the 20th and 21st century.
3. Ukraine gets crimea, donetsk and lugansk and will be paid war reparations.

This framework allows Russian people to lead normal relationships with the free world, allows them to save face while creating a system where Russian tyrants won't engage in wars of agression.

If this framework isn't implemented we run the following risks.

1. Putin remains in power, has sanctions lifted, builds up the economy and army and starts another war.
2. Even if Putin is removed another russian imperialistic leader will replace him and will do the same procedure: play friends with the west to have sanctions lifted and for foreign companies to come back to Russia, build up the economy again and rebuild the army and finally start another war.

If this framework or another similar one won't be applied we will pass on the problem of Russian imperialism to our children and grandchildren.",False,1646660718.0,t3_t8lhjo,t3_t8lhjo,,0,29,0,29,1,0,

1. Lack of Ukrainian support on the Kashmir issue at the U.N.

3. Ukraine voting to sanction India for nuclear weapons development.

Russia is looking for a counter offer and it might accept for just getting two breakaway territories and a promise not to join nato. I don’t think Ukraine should or would make a counter offer.

I think this special op is going to be completely humiliated and collapsed before may. And they know it.

Russia can’t fix its military problems as quickly as Ukraine can effectively use its new toys and steady stream of fresh help coming into the country. 

I think starting Wednesday it begins to unravel. The last 48 hours showed no new gains. Momentum has ceased for Russia. 

Now the new Ukrainian toys are getting spread and foreign fighters will probably be reaching fronts by end of the week if not before. I think the real chaos for Russia is about to begin. I think it’s going to be a humiliation.

Russia’s latest offer asked for them to specifically accept the independence of their two eastern territories. If they thought they could succeed I don’t think these two territories would be indenified specifically. That combined with the last gains in the last 48 hours, known logistical issues, and the reluctance for an amphibious assault which I bet is a morale issue, leads me to this belief.

The fear is understandable too - initially it was unthinkable to many that he’d actually invade, then he did and the nuclear threat came, the attacks on civilians, the stories of rape, childrens hospitals being attacked, the nuclear plant coming under fire…so it’s understandable that for a lot of people Putin now seems unpredictable, vengeful and perhaps unhinged. I don’t think he’s at the stage of this invasion where nuclear attacks are an option, but it would be silly to discount it being part of his plan/response. 

Who knows what will happen next - if this will go on for as long as they say it will, it’s impossible to say where he may slip up, escalate or just decide fuck it, and attack a NATO state (simplified I know).

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

 >Russia began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. The invasion is the largest conventional military attack in Europe since World War II. After the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatist forces seized part of the south-eastern Ukrainian region of the Donbas, launching an ongoing war in the region. In March 2021, Russia began assembling military forces along the Russia–Ukraine border, creating the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis.

One of the main advantages of investing in a publicly traded company is liquidity of the shares. If you invest in a company that's not on a stock exchange, selling your shares later on is complicated as you have to find a buyer and negotiate a price (and how do you even determine a price?). On a stock market, you simply submit a sell order and normally the shares are sold very quickly.

This liquidity makes it much more attractive to invest in publicly traded companies than in other companies. So such companies will be able to attract far more investment money. But if the stock market can close for extended periods, that means that your ability to sell your investment can get taken away just like that. Investors will have to think twice before investing, making it harder for companies to get new investments.

In the short term, keeping the stock market closed prevents panic selling and the cascading effects that can bring. There is something to be said for circuit breakers and other measures that allow the market to take a breathe and carefully evaluate the situation.

But in the long term, the stock market being closed makes investing in Russian companies much less attractive. Even when the sanctions are gone, investors, especially foreign ones, will have to keep in mind that whenever they invest in Russia, there's a chance their investment could simply get locked up for an indeterminate amount of time.",False,1646667219.0,t3_t8lhjo,t1_hzpnfkm,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Russia has no good options regarding its markets right now; they've already hit hyper inflation by some definitions and if the market were open there'd be a massive selloff leading to/as part of a panic sale.

The central bank of Russia appears to be:

* Trying to rig/install protections against that selloff - capping foreign currency holdings, trying to force biz's and oligarchs to park their money in the Russian market to prop it up. Whether it's rigging or protections depends on your perspective.

* Delay opening until after the initial shock of a surprise war wears off in the hopes of stemming the worst of panic selling.

* Delay opening until the central bank can stabilize the Rouble - wait for the effects of an almost unheard of interest rate hike to set in.

* Wait out the war - seems like Russia thought this could be over quickly in which case waiting to open markets until the war resolves could remove a lot of uncertainty from the market, especially regarding additional sanctions.

The west wants to keep pressure on and uncertainty high which in turn forces the central bank of Russia's hand. Massive uncertainty is poison to markets. The next likely step is boycotting Russian oil, but the west would love to not have to do this as we're already in an inflation crisis and cutting off such a large supplier will cause fuel prices to skyrocket more than they already have. All physical supply chains incorporate cost of movement into the equation, so a dramatic spike in oil prices will translate into a very quick raise in the prices of everything else, which in turn means wages don't go as far and we're back at the beginning of another inflation cycle. Ideally Russia will pull out soon, but I don't think it likely.

So Russia could keep the markets closed until the war is over and in fact that's probably one of the options under consideration. Doing so may prevent immediate panic selling which would have other terrible knockdown effects within the economy but the longer it stays down the longer it will take to re-establish any confidence in the Russian markets making recovery that much harder.",1646668496.0,1646667424.0,t3_t8lhjo,t1_hzpnfkm,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

He warned Obama that Jackson-Vanik was tantamount to war, of which he had nuclear weapons.

He's ignored his economy, cratered most industries and created a petro-state with almost no other economic mechanisms. His infrastructure is a joke and while he spends billions on hypersonic weapons, most of his military is in shambles.

Our strategists etc are saying here that for Russia to occupy-occupy Ukraine, 200k forces they had wasn't even nearly enough, not nearly enough to do that, even 500 000 wouldn't have been. Even if Kyiv should be encircled, they still say that fighting in an urban environment, in a city that large, is very very difficult. 

They may put a puppet government in place, but that government will fall the moment they turn their backs, so the only option is to heavily and militarily control everything, which they cannot do. 

The insurgency is expected to be very strong similar to that which USSR experienced in Afghanistan. 

They can ""win"", but they won't ""win"", you know? They can get cities, but they'll continue having to fight the insurgency. 

That's why we see increased bombing and shelling - they want to starve, bomb, and kill people to surrender, to break their motivation and resolve to resist. Problem is that Ukrainians know what will come with Russian occupation - both historically and from Donbas/Luhansk. Quite plenty of the people who rejoiced over Donbas and Luhansk have discovered in the 8 years past that Russian promises are lies and life, in fact, hasn't gotten better, but worse. Being a ""republic"" that only Russia, Belarus and some odd similar ""republics"" recognise is a very singular and lonely experience and often means being pisspoor and completely tied to Russia.

The air losses are much higher too - the expectation was Russia would get air superiority so their helicopters and fighters can provide significant support to ground troops, but they keep losing aircraft to defences and Ukrainian air assets which are still active. This has massively reduced Russia's advantage in the conflict. The fact Ukraine is still operating drones for bombing runs on Russian forces is also a huge force multiplier which I don't think was really considered before the war.

Ukraine doesn't have to kill every invading soldier to win either - low morale, equipment attrition, lack of supplies all reduce Russia's strength and they could reach a point where they can't advance anymore and can get pushed back.

Essentially the USA would conduct an air superiority campaign from airfields from neighbouring allied countries, and just bomb the living shit out of anything remotely military. At some point they'd mobilise the 900k forces they have ready at all borders, and just slowly encroach upon pockets of resistance, bag and tag or take prisoners, until Ukraine would surrender to a shitload of sanctions and debts.

Now Russia ""should"" have had the same options, except for that their objectives are different, and their army composition is different (far more tank/artillery focused).",1646650268.0,1646649815.0,t3_t8lhjo,t1_hzotatn,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

This assumes, of course, that they fully provisioned the ships prior to leaving port and based on their lack of supplies to their land-based forces, they may not have.

No, it freezes Ukraine out of defensive alliances, leaving Ukraine vulnerable the next time Russia wants a bite. Ceding Donbas or Crimea to Russia says that war will allow it to keep bites it's already taken.

Multiple treaties, that Russia signed, have explicitly ruled out territorial conquest. To compromise with Russia is to say that the UN charter, the Helsinki Accords, all of it, means nothing.

The problem is, there would be no guarantee then that they wouldn't just invade again in 1-2 years time. They could use the time to build up again and redo their strategy based on the information they've learnt.

Obviously Ukraine could build up too, but it takes a while to rebuild, and a lot of Ukrainians will take the full length of the EU visas due to the fear of another Russian invasion.

Realistically, Russia would have a better shot the second time and having Ukraine agree to not take their best bet against a further invasion would leave them in a similar position for a second invasion later down the line.

Honestly, if we would 'model UN' this shit... I would play Russia at their own game. I'd agree to those terms, making Ukraine conflict free (officially) for the first time in 8 years. I'd then do backroom deals on the down low to get Ukraine into NATO. I'd only announce it once the deal is done. Then if Russia wants to invade, they have to fight NATO. They wouldn't dare.

NATO countries being attacked for instance.  That's a line that's been made very clear.  If Putin violates it, we know there was little chance of avoiding nuclear war anyway.

BUT, if our communication has been very clear that a certain action will not generate a military response from NATO, and then Russia takes that action, it would be stupid to impulsively change our minds, because it is not clear that nuclear war is inevitable in that instance.

The time to make clear our response to Russia invading Ukraine was *before they invaded* (and we did - sanctions). Now it is too late.  We could maybe put Lviv under NATO protection at this point with a lot of communication about our rules and intent.  Maybe.

&#x200B;

Russia wants out of the war, it fucked up and the cost is too great for it to sustain. But it can't back out yet until it gets at least part of its objectives. So now it will try to negotiate a ceasefire that:

&#x200B;

1. Allows it to claim victory internally
2. Allows it to ""try again"" in a few years after it has reformed its army and has properly  prepared its economy.

&#x200B;

Today's proposal was Russia basically offering the first concession:

\- no demilitarization

\- Zelensky stays as president (but with a russian puppet as a PM).

&#x200B;

**Crimeea and Donbas** will always be red lines (especially Crimeea), because if Russia gives up on any of them it will effectively have lost territory. This would be humiliating for Russian and if it's one thing Russia/Russians hate is any hint of humiliation.

**Ukraine not joining NATO** is a guarantee that Russia will try this invasion again. If Ukraine is in NATO then basically it is immune to Russian aggression.

&#x200B;

If the war continues to go poorly for Russia (as in not making progress, I don't think they can be pushed back to the border), then the other conditions may be diluted in time. I would expect the conditions would become:

\- Crimeea is recognized as Russian

\- Separatist regions are recognized as part of Ukraine but with a degree of autonomy

\- Ukraine does not join NATO but perhaps allowed to join the EU (without US military might the EU would seem like a more favorable adversary for a conflict in 10 years).

Also only a part of these regions is taken. It's effectively a state in civil war (if you recognise them independently). So you would be sacrificing all those who want a unified Ukraine. 

Additionally, we can't just forget the other demands, because Putin wont. They come as a package.

Not being allowed to Join NATO makes them a target for a regrouped attack at a later date. Perhaps after a Russian backed leader attempts to get elected and mysteriously wins? They've used a similar tactic before.

Additionally they would have to cede Crimia officially.

Then post invasion, Ukraine would be puppeted and key regions annexed at the cost of some minor sanctions from the US. At this point the threat of Russia's demonstrated military power and Europe's dependence on Russian resources, would help him ""re-orientate"" Eastern Europe away from the EU into Russia's sphere of influence, up to the point where (with political interference) they expect the EU would collapse.

This would then usher in a new ""multi-polar"" world with an increasingly isolated US and divided Europe, whereby Russia and China would essentially dominate global affairs together. With this accomplished Russia could then formally annex or create a ""puppet union"" of the former Russian empire's occupied territories, constituting a new glorious Russian empire. Its all in Russian philosopher Alexandr Dugin's book called ""Foundation of Geopolitics"" which is apparently acting as a blueprint for Moscow's foreign policy approach.

Russian Orthodox tried a mini coup of sorts almost 10 years ago by separating from the Greek Orthodox, with it's patriarchal seat in since Byzantine times in Constantinople, even through today to Istanbul. The Russians have basically since forever been claiming themselves as ""the third rome"" since the Greeks up until their independence still referred to themselves as Romans.

They've (the Russian Orthodox church) since split into their own leadership (like how the Coptic Orthodox have their own pope) where as before they would take direction from Istanbul, all because the Greek Orthodox Church gave Ukrainian Orthodox churches the right to self govern themselves, but still take direction from Istanbul. Previously the Russians had the Ukrainians under the umbrella.

Now consider that each piece of equipment would likely be accompanied by minimum of 4 personnel. You'll have some with 1 or 2 like some helicopters and aircraft and also some with upwards of 10 like trucks and carriers. Tank crews of 4 or 5, armoured vehicles all 4 or 5, vehicles such as the armoured cars would be 4, crews of artillery would be 4 or 5 per, plus the ammo carriers and crew for those being 4 or 5. Then consider that most of the helicopters they are using are likely filled with troops such as the MI-24/35 which can carry up to 8 fully geared soldiers plus crew, so 10. Average soldiers per vehicles is likely up around 6. So they would have around 29,000 pieces of equipment/vehicles. 

Now the estimates are that it is already around 2000 vehicles lost. That is a little over 6.5%. This is an estimate of losses. Both troops and equipment at around 6.5%.

Russia has committed their ground reserves, so there is a chance, but in practice not much of one while the Russian Air Force is present.

Spies in Russia’s infamous security apparatus were kept in the dark about President Putin’s plan to invade Ukraine, according to a whistleblower who described the war as a “total failure” that could be compared only to the collapse of Nazi Germany.

A report thought to be by an analyst in the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB, said that the Russian dead could already number 10,000. The Russian defence ministry has acknowledged the deaths of only 498 of its soldiers in Ukraine.

The report said the FSB was being blamed for the failure of the invasion but had been given no warning of it and was unprepared to deal with the effects of crippling sanctions.

The whistleblower added that no one in the government knew the true figure of the dead because “we have lost contact with major divisions”.
FSB officers had been ordered to assess the effects of western sanctions, they said, but were told that it was a hypothetical box-ticking exercise. “You have to write the analysis in a way that makes Russia the victor . . . otherwise you get questioned for not doing good work,” they wrote. “Suddenly it happens and everything comes down to your completely groundless analysis.

“[We are] acting intuitively, on emotion . . . our stakes will have to be raised ever higher with the hope that suddenly something might come through for us.
“By and large, though, Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.”
The letter said that Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and an ally of Putin, was on the verge of outright conflict with the Russians after his “hit squad”, sent to kill President Zelensky, was destroyed by Ukrainian forces.

Even if Zelensky were killed, the report said, Russia would have no hope of occupying Ukraine. “Even with minimum resistance from the Ukrainians we’d need over 500,000 people, not including supply and logistics workers.”

The analyst said that the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, was trying to “dig up dirt” to claim that Ukraine had built nuclear weapons, a pretext for a pre-emptive strike.

The 2,000-word document was published by Vladimir Osechkin, a Russian human rights activist who runs the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net.

Christo Grozev, an expert on the Russian security services, said he had shown the letter to two FSB officers, both of whom had had “no doubt it was written by a colleague”.

Grozev, who reported the identities of the Salisbury poisoners with the investigative website Bellingcat in 2018, said: “Ukraine had previously leaked fake FSB letters as psy-ops.

“This letter appeared different, though. It came via a reputable source [Osechkin] and it was way longer than a forger would choose to make it.”
The FSB is led by Alexander Bortnikov, a confidant of Putin. They have known each other since the 1970s, when they both served as KGB officers in Leningrad. Bortnikov’s son, Denis, is chairman of VTB bank and is among those sanctioned by the UK.

The war, the writer said, had been given a “provisional deadline” of June because by then the Russian economy will have collapsed. “I have hardly slept at all recently, working all hours, in a brain-fog,” they wrote. “Maybe it’s from overwork, but I feel like I am in a surreal world. Pandora’s Box has been opened.”
The author said they could not rule out international conflict and that they were expecting “some f***ing adviser to convince the leadership” to send an ultimatum to the West threatening war if sanctions were not lifted.

“What if the West refuses?” they wrote. “In that instance I won’t exclude that we will be pulled into a real international conflict, just like Hitler in 1939.” Elsewhere in the letter they said: “Our position is like Germany in 1943-44 — but that’s our starting position.”

Disquiet is growing in Russia, articulated by a senator whose late husband was once a mentor to Putin.
Lyudmila Narusova, 70, was the wife of Anatoly Sobchak, the first democratically elected mayor of St Petersburg, who died in mysterious circumstances in 2000 as Putin ascended to the presidency. She acknowledged the huge number of Russian casualties, saying that out of one company of 100 conscripts only four had survived.

She also confirmed that conscripts had been forced to sign contracts committing them to fight in Ukraine.
Twelve months of military service is mandatory between the ages of 18 and 27 for Russian men. The Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia said last week that many soldiers had been tricked into enlisting. They had been told they were heading to the border for drills, the group said, but their contracts were changed to include conflict.

Narusova said: “Yesterday conscripts were withdrawn from the warzone in Ukraine who had been forced to sign a contract. . . from a company of a hundred men only four were left alive.”

Last week she told Dozhd, an independent television channel, that dead Russian soldiers in Ukraine lay “unburied, wild, stray dogs gnawing on bodies that in some cases cannot be identified because they are burnt”.

“I do not identify myself with those representatives of the state that speak out in favour of the war,” she said. “They are following orders without thinking.”",1646663820.0,1646663631.0,t3_t8lhjo,t1_hzpgb0u,,2,20,0,20,0,0,

It empowers the President of the United States as the primary negotiator of agreements between the United States and other countries, which, upon receiving the advice and consent of a two-thirds supermajority of the Senate, become binding with the force of federal law.
 
**[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances)** 
 
 >The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances comprises three identical political agreements signed at the OSCE conference in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994 to provide security assurances by its signatories relating to the accession of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.

There are countries who have a non-diversified industry based on the sale of fossile hydrocarbons.

Other economies like UAE, Qatar are trying to diversify into service industries, etc.

This must cause enormous pressure on the future development of the aformentioned economies, of which some barely will have a chance to reform themselves if 2035 were actually the target.

Ultimately this results in the turmoils we currently see. It feels like the attempt to bully others into dependence on their natural resource for additional time.

 >The Soviet invasion of Poland was a military operation by the Soviet Union without a formal declaration of war. On 17 September 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, sixteen days after Germany invaded Poland from the west. Subsequent military operations lasted for the following 20 days and ended on 6 October 1939 with the two-way division and annexation of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. This division is sometimes called the Fourth Partition of Poland.

 >The Bob Semple tank was a tank  designed by New Zealand Minister of Works Bob Semple during World War II. Originating out of the need to build military hardware from available materials, the tank was built from corrugated iron on a tractor base. Designed and built during a period of uncertainty in which New Zealand feared having to defend itself from Japanese invasion without external assistance, these tanks were a civilian effort to design and create a means to protect New Zealand. Designed and built without formal plans or blueprints, it had numerous design flaws and practical difficulties, and was never put into mass production or used in combat.

If Covid has shown anything, then it has shown to us in the west that a lot of global production - either completely or partly - depends on china and shipping. For example, there are companies here that otherwise would be completely capable of producing their products without china, but they had  one single yet important part that they needed, which they were buying from China, and once covid cut that route off, they were quickly trying to scramble to find another from Europe. We're a lot more enmeshed, economically, with China than we want to admit and China would just love to squeeze us a bit for that. 

At the same time, it's not like China can give us up either, true. Someone has to buy everything they produce and we in the west are fantastic consumers. 

If you look at China's foreign policy, then their goalposts aren't 5-10 years, they're going for a 50 year, 100 year perspective. There is a reason why there's been an explosion of Chinese tech companies in the last 10 years - because China set up to develop  and research domestic tech capabilities from 1980s onward, IIRC. They plan a lot for their stuff with a very long-range view of the future - 10 years is as good as tomorrow for them, for example. 

Also - a lot of the stuff that's propped up in the last decade or 15 years in China has specifically been made to counter US-Western systems. For example, the World Bank and IMF have quite stringent demands if a developing country wants a loan/money, but the AIIB does not. There's also a reason why China has been building infrastructure, ports, roads etc. in Africa, for example. OBOR initiative is the same. 

So in that sense - yes, they are enmeshed with us for now, but for how long if they manage to continue as they are and grow economically? 

China is doing what China considers best for China. If it were in their interests to support the West in this war, they would. But they aren't, because it isn't in their interests (because they too would like to take Taiwan like Russia would like to take Ukraine). At the same time, although they issue declarations of friendship to Russia, all that China really wants from Russia is cheap fuel and the chance to buy up Russia's assets cheaply as well. Russia may see itself as an ally to China, but it's almost guaranteed that China does not see Russia as their equal. 

India is a bit more trickier. India wasn't supported by the US in their war against Pakistan, whilst USSR did support India, IIRC. And US still has (or at least had, not sure if they do anymore) their base in Pakistan, so that's ruffling some feathers in India as well.",False,1646651865.0,t3_t8lhjo,t1_hzouyjp,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

From Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, Syria, and Kazakhstan, Russia's army has faced small outgunned factions. They have never faced a sizable opponent like Ukraine. 

Clearly, Putin assumed the Euromaiden had not worked to unify Ukrainians. At best, his army would have no more difficulty repressing protesting peasants than in Belarus or Kazakhstan. At worst, he'd have to barrel bomb them for a few days, as he did against the FSA in Syria. It almost feels like Putin still thinks it's 2014; that the new democracy is just a bunch of protesters incapable of shooting back. Idealists who haven't done anything to reform the old-regime or build a loyal Ukrainian military. 

Premises were wrong. Putin clearly underestimated the willpower of Ukraine and its ability to fight with sizable armies. As importantly from a military front, he underestimated soft military power. Morale matters in war and he's failed miserably at giving Russian conscripts motivation to fight hard in a modern war. By contrast, Ukraine still retains ability to contest air superiority and gain tactical victories, and has motivation aplenty. They are clearly dealing Russia's own vaunted military multiple black eyes. Putin mistook his experience oppressing small groups in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, or Syria with real wars and real victories. America should diligently study this too. This is what a real conventional war looks like.

 >Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was a period of currency instability in Zimbabwe that, using Cagan's definition of hyperinflation, began in February 2007. During the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. However, Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79. 6 billion percent month-on-month, 89.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

That's not to say it wouldn't be figured out very quickly, but there are different scales of nuclear attack and response. Someone actually posted Russia's differing levels of military engagement, several days ago. You may have seen it. 

There was targeted use of non strategic nuclear weapons (tactical nukes, artillery, short, medium and long range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and gravity bombs, according to google)... right up to widespread use of strategic nuclear warheads (ICBM). Spread over 3 levels, if I remember correctly. There were also levels below those that came before use of any kind of nuclear weapon. Just conventional engagement.

It appeared as though we were immediately before use of non-strategic nuclear weapons. Land invasion of Crimea would then be triggering that kind of action. Like a warning essentially. 

If we got there, who knows how quickly it might escalate... but they were distinct levels.

It's already being done. 

USSR was not defeated by conventional or nuclear war. It was defeated economically. To such a point that it had to let go the Baltic countries, Ukraine, etc.

The sanctions that are in place now, and the ones that US and EU are talking about, are currently crushing Russia. If you keep them in place long enough, Russia will be sent back to stone age.
