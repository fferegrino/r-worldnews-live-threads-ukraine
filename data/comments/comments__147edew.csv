""Ukrainian President Zelensky’s chief diplomatic adviser Igor Zhovkva said Monday that the ""ultimate goal of the counteroffensive campaign is to win back all the territories, including Crimea."" 

During an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Zhovkva said some counteroffensive actions were already underway, but would not give details. 

He also sought to tamp down any expectations that the campaign would achieve rapid results, saying it could take many months for Ukraine to achieve its aims. 

In the same vein, he reminded Amanpour that this was not Ukraine’s first counteroffensive – a reference to the Ukrainian army’s successful advances in September and October when Russian forces were pushed out of the Kharkiv region and the northern part of the Kherson region.

The current push would “probably would not be the last counteroffensive operation,” he added. 

He also said that if Ukraine was going to be successful it needed Western partners to supply more artillery and ammunition.""",False,1686606790.0,t3_147edew,t3_147edew,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Ukraine has never outright overpowered Russia in a big battle and they might not expect to do so now. All of its victories minus Kharkiv, have been around destroying Russian logistics, force them to burn more than they have in heavy fighting and then offer them the poisined pill of either continuing the fight at an incredibly lopsided position or withdraw. This is how Ukraine defended Kyiv, they attacked the way less sexy targets like fuel and ammo depos and allowed the tanks to run out of gas. This is how they took over Kherson, they cut off the bridges, destroyed supplies with HIMARS and then forced the Russian troops to burn out their supplies in high intensity combat and ultimately forced to withdraw.

The only exception is Kharkiv, but Kharkiv wasn't Ukraine overpowering Russia either, but thunder runs that caused confusion and a rout making the troops there believe they were being overpowered.

Of course the better situation would be a Kharkiv scenario in the counteroffensive where the Russian army rapidly routs, but I don't know if this is possible when attacking an entrenched location. We are expecting Ukraine to just overpower Russia and force their way into their occupied territory, maybe they are attempting to do just that, but Ukraine might simply be forcing combat on them so that the shaping up we saw in these weeks end up forcing Russia to withdraw on its own like it happened in Kyiv and Kherson. Of course, it remains to be seen how feasible such a strategy is here. In Kherson they destroyed the supply routes in a static city, in Kyiv it was Russia advancing on the most well defended enemy territory.

War takes the best
Heavy fighting all yesterday (June 12) went on almost along
the entire line of military contact of the Vostok grouping, especially
on the so-called. Vremevsky ledge. The troops of the 5th
Army had to leave Makarovka, the difficult situation was
in the defense zone of the 60th and 37th motorized rifle brigades.
The problem of lack of ammunition is still acute.
As a result of an enemy missile attack, Major General Sergei
Goryachev, Chief of Staff of the 35th Combined Arms Army,
was killed.
A native of the Airborne Forces, Goryachev served as a soldier in the
Kirovabad airborne division, after the RVVDKU he commanded
a reconnaissance company, and then a parachute battalion in the 76th
division, was the chief of staff of the 108th regiment. In the future,
he led our contingent in Transnistria, commanded the 27th Motorized
Rifle Brigade, 201st military base in Tajikistan, and a training center
in Khabarovsk. Having joined the SVO as the commander of the 5th
separate tank brigade, he ""grew up"" to the deputy commander of
the 35th OA (with the rank of major general), was appointed
chief of staff of the army.
According to representatives of the command of the United
Forces (s), the army today lost one of the brightest and most
effective military leaders, who combined the highest
professionalism with personal courage.
Combat friends express their condolences to the families and friends of
the deceased.
R.S. Unfortunately, it was not possible to find a photograph of the
hero in a general's uniform, perhaps one does not exist, in the war there is
no time for a photo.

Old Soviet tactics against the Nazis were to take an area and defend with multiple lines of trenches with artillery and *absolute shit tons* of mines.

They would wait for an attack, absorb it usually decimating the attackers, then counter-attack the attack assuming a few advantages:
- that the attacking force has cleared portions of their lines of mines/defenses to facilitate the attack
- the enemy having just failed and potentially exhausted wouldn't be able to resist the counter-attack as effectively

Their beliefs and the stuff that reinforces them are largely immune to facts because they don't want to be wrong.

I just chip away at it anytime it comes up in conversation, I don't belittle or speak down, I just listen and respond calmly with evidence. One little event/thing at a time. I'll also avoid anything that is more subjective, even if we know the truth (i.e. Dam destruction) as they will just double down.

A complicating factor is that we're a very 'left', anti-imperialist family (American). I've detested what my country has done towards countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Nicaragua, Bolivia - I mean the list is very long. But in this instance, Russia is the imperialist force and we can think that perhaps there was a neo-fascist militia problem in Ukraine and also acknowledge that the far right in Ukraine did worse in their elections than they do in most other European countries - to put simply, its hard to buy that Ukraine is a Nazi threat to Russia; its just propaganda that per usual has a kernel of truth. A million seemingly contradictory facts can be true all once and thats not even to mention Russia's own far right elements, authoritarian rule and appeals to right wing culture war garbage that should not be ok with people and should raise red flags about Russia's true intentions. Reality is complicated but Russia has taken certain facts and distorted or exaggerated them to justify their aggression and desire to restore some sort of empire. But what also really irks me is not just the disagreement on refusing to acknowledge that countries other than the U.S. can be imperialist and that Russia is the aggressor but how people on the left who are supposed to place a high value on human life and be so compassionate have somehow found it so easy to ignore that its Ukrainian cities getting bombed, that its Russia attacking civilian infrastructure. Further, part of being anti-imperialist is recognizing that people in other countries should have their own agency and self-determination however in taking the view that Ukraine is being 'controlled' by the West, these elements of the left have essentially dehumanized Ukrainians by not acknowledging what should be an excruciatingly obvious fact by now - the Ukrainians have minds of their own and are choosing to fight because they do not want to be taken over by Russia.",False,1686599830.0,t3_147edew,t1_jnwpjoz,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

9/10 times someone who commits to extreme opinions like this is just craving validation. They want their feelings of being smart to be validated. They're also craving a strong desire for a vulnerable connection with someone. Fighting their desire for validation just makes it worse. They'll dig in, get defensive and argue you tooth and nail. A part of them may even know they're wrong. It doesn't mater, because they're arguing out of a place of emotion and their version of logic and not your logic. But don't tell that to them , because to them their emotions are the facts in that moment. They feel they're being logical, telling them they're not by disagreeing with them is worse thing someone can do, it tells them they shouldn't feel what they're feeling and just forces them to dig in even more.

Instead I would encourage you to give zero energy to it and instead, the next time when they do say something you agree with, validate the shit out of them. You'll be surprised to see what a little bit of validation like that will do for someone.

I also encourage you to look deep into yourself and ask yourself why you feel the need to correct your friends or to engage in these conversations with them. Are you truly coming from a place of love and understanding or are you also feeling that need for validation and connection?

If it's only 10,000, it would be incredible.

Few want to be the last one to die for a cause that fails anyway.  There are many who do put their life on the line when they know their country needs it.  You cannot fight as an insurgent if you get killed or captured in a failed attempt at peer to peer warfare.  

The fortified areas in Donetsk where there had been fighting before 2022 did hold along most of the line.  

Building battlements on a border is aggressive and provocative.   It is obvious Putin's attack was a stupid decision.  In hindsight Putin is obviously dumb enough to do it anyway.  From the standpoint of 2021 though provoking Russia would not have been a good idea either.   Imagine if i lived next door to you and started digging fox holes, sandbagging, and putting up razor wire.  

Stretching Russian supply lines made Russian formations vulnerable to attack.   Russian really did have a much larger amount of weapons at the war start.   Ukrainian and Russians were both mostly using Soviet weaponry.   If they had just mashed in a big battle it would have likely gone to the larger army.   Captured Russian vehicles are a significant fraction of Ukraine's current arsenal.   Those captures could not have happened without Russia extending itself into Ukraine.   

All of these factors multiply and add leverage.   

The leverage goes the other way too.  Russians are not cowards (if anything a reputation for stupid machismo).   The invasion was the wrong thing to do.  Demoralization of Russian soldiers causes them to lose despite starting with more arms.   It would have been rash for Ukraine to rely on that.

They don't care about 'losing' villages, never mind the lives of their soldiers. It only serves to give justification among the oligarchs to funnel more money into the military this time, not oil, from which they can continue embezzling money.

They don't care, doubly so because Russian people can't speak a word against this. 

""I'm sending your husband and son to Ukraine, I legitimately don't care what happens to them, because they are the reason I was able to 'win' this military contract, and I get to pocket half of it on principle to buy my 7th superyacht. And there is absolutely nothing you can do. Fuck you.""

I guess it's the same in the US, military contract is a dream come true for any company but relative to Russia there is a working democracy over there. 

It's just unfortunate Ukranians are caught in the middle of this grand moneymaking scheme this time around, I mean, Russian oligarchs have to make even more money somehow, and I think Ukraine got the short end of the stick owing to them trying to bolster their democracy. 

There was also a great comment somewhere here on how oligarchs were 'legally' looting the Russian central bank reserves owing to currency value differences caused by the war. Anyway.

I feel like those in power in Russia simply ran out of ways to squeeze the populace out of money without starting protests. Years of looting the country resulted in a disgruntled, or even radicalized populace, and ordering them to war suppressed and scared them enough, and at the same time it's a great way to shake them down for even more ""military"" money. Two birds with one stone.

So in short, we see the Russian deaths, but it probably has more impact on Ukranian morale than on Russia's perspective on this war.

In longer: Ukraine tries to strengthen the use of Ukrainian language by requiring students to study in Ukrainian from secondary education on. This is almost certainly a reaction to Russia using ""Russian-speaking minorities"" as an excuse for annexing Crimea and attacking the Donbas. But it also affects other minorities.

This has been a source of tension between Hungary and Ukraine for years even before the 2022 invasion. Poland and Romania also expressed concern but they were diplomatic about it, while Orbán's government (and iirc some Ukrainian politicians) used it to score points with their nationalist audiences.

Now it looks like Ukraine temporarily conceded by delaying this law for a year for minorities from EU countries. Note that Russia is not in the EU, so it still works to strengthen the use of Ukrainian relative to Russian.",1686607741.0,1686569915.0,t3_147edew,t1_jnvsxut,,2,21,0,21,0,0,

Polish and Hungarian are quite large ethnic minorities in Ukraine that often complained at their treatment - how justly I cannot say.

Ukraine is not unique. Ethnic Poles, for example, face an unpleasant situation in Belarus. Germany doesn't even give Poles who lived there for generations a minority status, which the Polish government is very angry with (even though Germans do have an ethnic minority status in Poland).

Actually I do the complete opposite. If they are in that deep, then it is psychological rather than rational. If that is the case, pointing out the underlying emotions can help them realise why they think that way, because they often do not realise that.

My approach is knowing when to stop. Clashing head on repeatedly past a certain point is not useful. Rather, once I point out the emotions underlying their logic, I stop there.

>* Muzzle flash in broad daylight? 


I think I can answer that one.  

Note the camera is pointed to the ground and no sky is visible within the frame.  The automatic aperture on the camera would be more open than if it were on the ground pointing across (due to the brightness of the sky) vs in the air pointing down where it's only collecting the light reflected off the ground.

Therefore the muzzle flash is competing with the light reflecting off the dirt. 

The other effect is the sampling rate of the camera.  If the camera adjusts its ""aperture"" by adjusting the sampling rate of the pixels, then some muzzle flashes will be visible if they are caught during the narrow time the sensors were ""open"".  Same deal with CRTs how some cameras will show the scrolling and uneven lines.

Example video of an AK47 being fired and how only some of the time the muzzle flash is visible.  Can be explained by the camera sensor refresh rate or different burn rates of the gunpowder for reach bullet.

The crews of these vehicles probably survived avoiding the need for retraining and unnecessary loss of life. The vehicles themselves may be damaged to various degrees, but the entire US logistics strategy is to make things interchangable and easy to replace. Hell even for the Abrams they can just drop the whole engine out of them, pop a good engine in, and then take the busted unit back to a shop way behind the front line (or even fly it back to the US) for service. Bradleys are no different, if the tracks are messed up, throw some new ones on. If the engine blew, swap it. If the turret was trashed, pop it off and put a new one on. 

As long as they can drag it to safety with a recovery vehicle, it's probably salvageable or will be, at a minimum, stripped for parts to repair other vehicles.

This is simply not true.  The original meaning was the southern, poor, agricultural labourer one and the bandana version (like the guy below citing the 1921 battle of Blair Mountain) would require time travel.

""Redneck"" was being used in the 19th century. This is from 1891:

   'Primary on the 25th.
   And the ""rednecks"" will be there.
   And the ""Yaller-heels"" will be there, also.
   And the ""hayseeds"" and ""gray dillers"", they'll be there, too.'

The 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain, in West Virginia, in which 10,000 to 20,000 coal miners looking for the right to unionize clashed with company enforcers, and then with the National Guard, over a deadly week of fighting. “It was the largest uprising since the Civil War, and one of the most significant labor uprisings in American history,” Catte says.

Something many people seem to forget or don't know is that Russia had massed large amounts of troops on Ukraine's borders 2 or 3 times before the build up to the 2022 invasion, including putting troops in Belorussia. Each time they had eventually withdrawn the vast majority of the soldiers and tensions calmed down. Now leading up to February 2022 it is true that they had amassed more soldiers and equipment than before but the previous build ups had still been very large and presented a credible threat of an invasion.

But since before the Russian's/Putin had backed down it was understandable that the Ukrainian government thought it was quite possible the same thing would happen again. Yes some western intelligence agencies like the US detected and/or had insider knowledge that they were going to actually invade this time and made that known but knowing for sure they were right is the benefit that hindsight gives you.

If Ukraine had started digging fortifications, conscripting people to bolster their army and moving them to the border it was not an unreasonable fear that Russia would use that to justify the invasion in the first place and since they had backed down before maybe it was best not to antagonize the situation. When Russian propaganda depicts the Ukrainian government as a Nazi regime hell bent on destroying Russia even a Ukrainian army along the border for defensive purposes would still have allowed them to pretend that Ukraine posed a threat to Russia. When Russia loves to cry about escalation a massive Ukrainian army on theirs and Belorussia's border would allow them to do that no matter how much bullshit it was. Plus who knows if Ukraine had seemed more aggressive maybe there would have been less support from the NATO and other nations when war finally did break out.

Looking back it's easy to wonder ""why didn't Ukraine do more to strengthen their defenses?"" and they probably should have in a few ways that wouldn't look like it was provoking confrontation too much but it was not crazy to think this was just another troop build up by Russia that was going to turn around and go back to their bases again.

Sure. That's a lot more doable than 200 a month.

If the dismounting crew doesn't suffer casualties. Which is a possibility, because whatever killed the IFV could be a threat to the crew after they dismount.

> Maybe territorial force personnel could be moved to offensive brigades, maybe new conscripts could be used

Rear security is far more important than offensive units. One of the things Russia is doing wrong is taking their minimally trained TDF troops and throwing them into assault battalions. I wouldn't doubt that Ukraine would actually take the time to train their TDF if they did intend to use them as maneuver units. But there would be moral issues, security concerns, and it could be a misallocation of manpower. A home guardsman or TDF trooper doesn't have to meet the same medical requirements as an assaulter. Allowing a nation to stretch its manpower pool more efficiently.

> The point is, there are so many Bradleys sitting in stockpiles. 

It might seem this way. But compared to the strategic requirements of the US (needing to be prepared to fight two major wars on two different continents at the same time), it is difficult to really estimate how many stockpiled AFVs are really ""spare"".

Ukraine might not care too much if the US fails at defending the western pacific from China. But America certainly does.

There are plenty of videos and articles on the defense of Hostomel and to be quite frank: It was pretty close. There were like 300 soldiers mostly from the from territorial defense units barely trained and weakly equipped at the airport even though it was known to be *the* target. Imagine how they could have slaughtered the russians of the first wave if they actually had combat ready AA and armored units there instead of conscripts with very few Iglas. AFAIK there were by pure chance artillery units near Kyiv which stopped the russians from landing more troops and enabled a counterattack. Similarly there are quite a few reports from the overrun south that many soldiers were on leave and much of the equipment elsewhere. Otherwise russia would have never been able to invade through the bottleneck at crimea.

Ukraine's defences and non military properties where in a infinitely weaker position then. Interestingly, you can track them day to day. Since the invasion, every day on average Russia gained less ground per day. With HIMARS they got reduced to a crawl, and eventually Ukraine's military became so good compared to pre invasion that they started reconquering land back.
