For those wondering about reactions in Russia, message of Dmitry Muratov, redactor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, who already lost 6 journalists assasinated by Putin ( Igor Domnikov, Iouri Chtchekotchikhine, Anna Politkovska√Øa, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Babourova, Natalia Estemirova) :

**Tey're still russians fighting the good fight, don't forget them, they are also heroes.**  
  
Translation :  
  
""We are all meeting early today in the newsroom. We are in grief.  
  
Our country, on President Putin's orders, has started a war with Ukraine. And there is no one to stop the war. So along with the grief, we and I feel ashamed.  
  
In his hands, the commander-in-chief, like a keychain from an expensive car, spins the ""nuclear button"". Is the next step a nuclear salvo? There is no other way to interpret Vladimir Putin's words about a weapon of retaliation.  
  
But we will publish this issue of Novaya Gazeta in two languages - Ukrainian and Russian. Because we do not recognize Ukraine as an enemy and Ukrainian as an enemy language. And we will never recognize it.  
  
And one last thing. **Only the anti-war movement of Russians can save life on this planet**.""

Sanctions are a good move. Holding out on further sanctions gives us bargaining power if the situation continues to escalate. Unfortunately it will take time for the effects to be felt, but hopefully it will cause further division between Russian citizens and the oligarchy. 

Lots of people want an immediate solution but putting boots on the ground escalates things dramatically at the expense of everyone, especially those on the front line. It seems like we are still gathering intelligence and communicating with other world leaders, and I think that is a good and diplomatic move. 

The reporters asked some silly questions, how can you expect Biden to predict the future about how China will react, if Putin will move past Ukraine, what exactly he meant by a vague threat, or how the stock market will handle it? 

I'm not a huge Biden fan, but people who are on his case for smirking at the ridiculousness of the reporters need to chill. There are more important things to be upset about.

China is Russia‚Äôs only major friend and the only permanent member of the UN Security Council which has not criticised Moscow over the Ukrainian issue. This is why Beijing‚Äôs refusal to publicly come out in Moscow‚Äôs favour over Ukraine, and thus be bracketed with Russia at a time when it is facing isolation by the West, is extremely significant.

  
Hua disagreed with the idea of calling the Russian strike an invasion. ‚ÄúRegarding the definition of an invasion, I think we should go back to how to view the current situation in Ukraine.

A statement from the Prime Minister's Office said PM Modi called for ""concerted efforts from all sides to return to the path of diplomatic negotiations and dialogue"".

There is nothing that any country can do right now, short of directly attacking Russia, that will make them stop. Not sanctions, not SWIFT, not embargo's, nothing. Ukraine will be alone fighting this because any direct involvement risks starting a global war.

NATO's goal is to ensure that this doesn't reach as far that. Hence troops on NATO borders, more supplies to Ukraine, etc.

So why wait on the sanctions? Sanctions are probably our best, universally approved hand to play. If you play it now Russia still finishes off Ukraine and then based on how well they're doing economically, decides whether to push their luck further.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of... Russia.

The risks are just too high. There are a lot of WWIII memes right now, but if the west did decide to put troops in Ukraine and defend the country, that's almost certainly what would happen. I have also read that Putin sent just enough troops to take Ukraine and not any more, so I doubt any NATO country is going to feel threatened enough to intervene. Putin is sending a clear message here : it is to Europe's advantage to let him take Ukraine.

 I also don't think there is any possibility of Russia backing down. The consequences of this invasion on Russia's economy are going to be huge, so if Putin doesn't succeed, he is done. He can't stop now and hope to remain the leader of Russia, and the past would indicate that his presidency ending like this would also mean the end of his life. Because of this, I don't think Putin will ever back down, no matter the severity of the sanctions.

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

on the margin of nonsense about closing borders:  
At present, all border crossings os Slovak Republic on the border with Ukraine are in operation, except for the ƒåierna nad Tisou - ƒåop railway border crossing, where passenger traffic has been stopped.  
**Entry will be granted to all persons fleeing the war.**  
**Entry into the territory of the Slovak Republic will be made possible after individual assessment also to persons who will not have a valid travel document (biometric passport).**

  
The current waiting times at the Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© border crossing are 8 hours and at the Ubƒæa border crossing 360 minutes. It cannot be ruled out that the waiting time at these border crossings may be extended.  
PLEASE NOTE: The Veƒæk√© Slemence border crossing will be open until 10 pm on Thursday, February 24. It should be open 24 hours a day from Friday, February 25.  
In the event of an increased influx of people from Ukraine to Slovakia, we are ready to strengthen the control and service at the Slovak-Ukrainian border and increase the number of border crossings by so-called hotspots. Here, the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic will also help the members of the Police Force so that we can register the incoming people and guide them.

NATO wants Ukraine to join so it can use it's land to install nukes in Russia's backyard. How many times has Russia opposed an iron dome missle defense around Europe in fear it can be used as an offense attack on Russia?

2 possibilities:

1) China is in on it and this is pretty much a diversion.

2) Putin's goal is to swing Ukrainian politics back to being pro-Russian.  Now, invading might not seem like a good way to do this but do remember a big chunk of the pro-Russian Ukrainians ended up being in territory that didn't vote in the last Ukraine election, namely the Donbas and Crimea.

If Putin can cause a big chunk of the younger pro-EU crowd out of Ukraine and bring back in the pro-Russian people, and then toss in a few years of dissent-smashing and pro-Russian propaganda, he might be able to do it.

It's odd that we're still getting live-streams out of Ukraine.  Russia is fairly well known for their above-average electronics warfare capability.  You'd think they could avoid having border traffic cams stream their armoured columns driving through.  But, they didn't.  They didn't take out the power grid nor wipe out the internet, as you would expect them to do.  It's almost like they want everyone to see what they're doing.

Even if only 30% of the gas comes from Russia, losing that would be the equivalent of having *all* of the nuclear facilities in the US shutting down overnight, and then some.

Also, many heavy industries (steel mills, chem etc.) rely on natural gas, and some plants simply can't be switched off (they would ""break"", to put it in simple terms).

Basically, gas being denied would be equivalent to have major industrial sites being bombed without any hope for recovery.

As I see it the scenarios are:

1:  Install a puppet government and leave a limited ""peacekeeping"" force .

The problem with this is that I think Ukrainians will rebel against that regime, and many of those rebels will be ex millitary, US backed and have popular support. I don't see how a puppet regime can survive without constant, huge, Russian deployments there.

2: Annex it as part of Russia formally, deploy occupation forces long term.

Problem with this is it will be very expensive at a time that Russia can hardly afford to fund an Iraq style occupation. There will also likely be a bloody insurgency, the issue will keep being pushed into the limelight in the west everytime something happens. More sanctions, more condemnation, lots of dead soldiers and very little benefit

And obviously 99% of commenters here don‚Äôt have a clue about the full picture.

Switzerland is looking into further regulations concerning these assets and is fully backing EU and UN sanctions with a special administrative act to prohibit circumnavigations via Switzerland.

Remember one corner stone of foreign policy is armed neutrality. Maintaining some distance to the conflict parties and offering a place of dialog.

There has been a significant of arguing about the current administrative order and the difference to sanctions. I watched the point of press and was kinda shocked how often they had to explain it to the press.

The order backs most sanctions put in place by EU (exception freezing money - which they first check with experts in the field on suitability) but is named ‚Äúorder to prevent circumnavigation of sanctions‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsanctions‚Äù.

With the next EU / UN sanction package, UN sanctions are automatically taken over, EU sanctions will be assessed along the Embargo law and either copy pasted (rephrased in order to stay ‚Äúneutral‚Äù) or replaced by orders better fitting our legal system here.

Note to banks: You clearly forget the long arm of US / EU justice. As these are internationally operating companies, banks and insurances might just get fucked by US or EU legal framework.

The embargo law is a source for sanctions but for that an emergency act needs to be enacted first.

Further, if you watch the whole video, there‚Äôs a part where the government speaker is saying, that it is the governments goal to ensure that EU sanctions are not circumnavigated at all.

Neutrality probably comes with pissing some a bit off, but it‚Äôs important that the parties in conflict have a place to talk.

SWIFT processes international payments, including those related to oil/natural gas.

If you don't (can't) pay for the gas, you won't get the gas.

It's about much more than heating in private houses: electrical power in Italy is mostly (70%) generated by burning gas, for example. Even if only 30% of the gas comes from Russia, losing that would be the equivalent of having *all* of the nuclear facilities in the US shutting down overnight, and then some.

Also, many heavy industries (steel mills, chem etc.) rely on natural gas, and some plants simply can't be switched off (they would ""break"", to put it in simple terms).

Basically, gas being denied would be equivalent to have major industrial sites being bombed without any hope for recovery.

It's not like Boris Johnson is a hero and Sch√∂ltz/Draghi are cowards.

If *Russia* wants to escalate to nuclear then that is squarely on the head of Putin, and any of his cronies willing to go along with it. I simply don't care.

You know what I **DO** care about?

I care about the damn near 100 years and trillions and dollars spent on the American military. I care about the entire history that every single American on reddit has only known as being 'the world police'.

The US has spent DECADES and DECADES fucking around in nearly every single damn country on this planet. We have NO problems flat out assassinating people in the Middle East, or South America all for the sake of profit for US corporations.

This is literally the ONE opportunity the US has had, during the entire lifetime of anyone who reads this, to ACTUALLY do the right thing. To ACTUALLY be the 'bastion of moral good' that we pretend to be.

When does it stop? We just let Putin and Russia kill thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of innocent Ukrainians? ""Because they have nukes"". What if Putin wants to invade another country? Are we literally just going to give up every non-nuclear country in the world to whoever *has* nukes and wants them, you know, just because?

The possibility of nuclear war IS THE REALITY. It's the bed that we, as humans have made. We can't just run from it forever -> it's a near certainty that at some point we DO have nuclear war. Maybe that's this year, maybe it's in 100 years I don't know. But it's clear that we aren't eliminating nukes entirely, and the resources of this planet are only dwindling and the future is looking dire with climate change. Sooner or later someone *with* nukes will get desperate.

Morally, DEFENDING Ukraine is the right thing to do, by whatever means necessary.

If we had troops on the ground before the invasion, training Ukrainian troops (as they were already there and doing that), it would act as a deterrent to Putin. We fucked up pulling troops out. Hard. I agree entirely with Bolton (was an NSA Adviser) on this stance.

That said, it DOES risk the escalation of the war. Again, US Troops faced off with Putin's private army in Syria. Trump ordered strikes that killed hundreds. That didn't escalate anywhere near threat of war. So there's a fine line that has to be walked.

Unfortunately right now, since troops have been pulled and invasion already began, we're coming from a severely weakened position. Although sending troops is unequivocally the right thing to do, it likely leads to war with US and Russia.

Ukraine is not Biden's fault - he is being decisive with sanctions, has unified NATO against Russia, and put out transparent intelligence about all of Putin's plans. No US administration has previously been able to counter Putin's firehose of falsehoods as effectively. I have been incredibly impressed with how effective exposing all the plans early has been.

This is extremely misguided and frankly it's obvious that you are poorly educated on the subject. These are talking points of anti-renewable propagandists that have long been debunked. Capacity is irrelevant, what matters is average energy production. It's mathematically implausible that renewable energy production across the entirety of Europe will at any second fall below what's necessary. It's not possible for wind across the continent to just stop blowing everywhere and solar is producing energy with clouds too and of course there is storage. 

>Reliable power production to supplement it is absolutely necessary

We know that isn't true, studies of energy markets have shown the opposite.

>and today Germany uses ""natural gas"" 

[https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts)

It's 15.3%. And again, that's peaker plants, which are neither permanently turned on, nor allow for a fast response.

>Nuclear is another option that can offer independence, or at least independence from Russia.

The problem with nuclear is twofold. 1) it's the cost 2) it's the problem of end storage.

>Nuclear is also objectively the safest form of energy production.

As you noticed, we, nevertheless, continue to make our own spacecraft. And we will do them by expanding the production of the necessary components and devices at home. 2. Do you want to ban all countries from launching their spacecraft on the most reliable Russian rockets in the world?  


This is how you are already doing it and are planning to finally destroy the world market of space competition from January 1, 2023 by imposing sanctions on our launch vehicles. We are aware. This is also not news. We are ready to act here too. 3. Do you want to destroy our cooperation on the ISS?

It's mathematically implausible that renewable energy production across the entirety of Europe will at any second fall below what's necessary. It's not possible for wind across the continent to just stop blowing everywhere and solar is producing energy with clouds too and of course there is storage.

That goes at the cost of area and material demand. Meaning that you have to perform more excavations and intrusions into nature for these renewable power systems. 

Renewables in urban areas is one thing, having to destroy nature to build and place them is another thing.


>We know that isn't true, studies of energy markets have shown the opposite.


https://theconversation.com/if-a-solar-plant-uses-natural-gas-is-it-still-green-50046

>The problem with nuclear is twofold. 1) it's the cost 2) it's the problem of end storage.

https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-spent-nuclear-fuel for waste management, and I would also like to add that technology is in development to re-use nuclear waste in second reactors, to break it down even further.

But you must never forget that nuclear is the exception, not the norm when it comes to waste management in power production. Fossil plants just spew their waste straight into the surrounding area and nature and take no measurement to clean up their mess.

This also adds to the cost of nuclear (along with having the airplane safety standard of energy production.)

>All non-fossil forms of energy production are extremely safe, so this is misleading again.

You are right, but my criticism is mostly in regards to unreliability (we can't control the weather), area and resource use of renewables, and the necessity of conversion and storage of the energy they produce (when its a lot of wind you have to overproduce and then save the energy for times where there is very little wind). Nuclear is a great alternative for the required baseline and supplementary **requirement** that renewables demand, which is now currently being taken up by ""natural gas"" (still hydrocarbons that warms up the atmosphere).",False,1645735319.0,t3_t0jlsj,t1_hyab9f8,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

No, thats impossible. Because atoms are literally the most energy dense form that exists (that we've discovered at least). A nuclear reaction has one milllion times more energy than a standard chemical reaction (burning fossil fuels), and renewable energy is finite. Windturbines only operate at certain windspeeds, and solar panels have a an absolute finite value depending on where in the world you are (less atmosphere = more kW/m^^2). It still gets nowhere close to nuclear.

>That is largely not the case.

You think those windturbines, and all the electrical rectifiers and other conversion technology is purely dependant on fully recyclable resources? 

There are a lot of ""rare earth metals"" involved.


>This is not a solution to end storage. Re-using burn fuel only takes care of a small fraction of nuclear waste.

Which can probably be reduced with more research and development.  And keep in mind that nuclear waste and resource usage is absolutely minimal, because as I said earlier there is so significantially more energy in nuclear reaction as oppose to all the other alternatives, which means you use a lot less fuel and produce less waste.


>I repeat once again, that peaker plants do not provide a baseline, that is not their job.


They can however, Nuclear can also be developed to be more flexible, or you can just use it as the baseline and then use energy storages for flexibility.

Its still better than covering the entire planet in renewables in my eyes, as someone who is quite passionate about nature and wildlife epsecally. Nuclear simply uses less space and resources than all alternatives, and this is based on objective physics.

Hell, even as things stand right now, which is a very low level of threat, Estonia is already invoking article 4.

{Citation Needed} - Immigrants tend to recognize Democrats are more humanitarian and choose to attempt to seek a better life under Democrats. So yes, more empathetic? Certainly. 

>Biden's inflation levels are horrible.

Blame Trump's incompetence with (a) Defunding the WHO during a global pandemic, (b) Dismantling the pandemic task-force, and (c) saying that COVID would be gone by Easter 2020 as he routinely steam-rolled his health experts.

Further, blame the gullible uneducated conservative base of supporters who lap this up and ignored mask mandates, believed vaccines would give them microchips or some other conspiracy theory bullshit, and continued to drag out the pandemic and exacerbating the strain on our healthcare facilities (fun-fact, this past year Republicans have been dying from covid over democrats at around 4-5x the rate).

>More people died of Covid under him than Trump during the same amount of time, even with a vaccine.

This makes no sense; COVID had barely arrived by the 2nd quarter and didn't yet saturate the nation. I work in a hospital. Additionally Delta was an order-of-magnitude more deadly and infectious than the first variant. You are grossly out of your element of understanding. Don't be so foolish and gullible.

Ultimately, what you use to conclude this little factoid is utterly irrelevant.

>Student loans haven't even been touched yet.

Not true, actually. Repayment for most people have been paused. Substantive action on this issue also requires Congress which is currently being filibustered by--you guessed it--Republicans.

>Im not a Trump stan at all, didn't vote for him in either election. I don't think either are good presidents. 

You sure quack like one, though.

>Trump promoted the vaccines and created a Covid response team with people that didn't align with his views, so please hop off with that nonsense.

Give me a break, he threw the leading expert under the bus routinely. He repeatedly said that Covid would be gone immediately after he lost the election, alluding to it being a hoax. 

>And then this ""I can say that at least Biden isn't suggesting people drink bleach"" is why we can't have an honest discussion.
