Day 12 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today was way more peaceful than yesterday, but at one point there was some sound of presumably a tank shooting something and it was continuously shooting for around an hour, with each shot sound was moving closer to us and eventually it just stopped.

Thankfully today we didn’t hear any aircraft at all, there are some lone sounds of explosions but at this point unless we are getting shelled non-stop or a plane is flying right above us we don't even really pay any attention to it, it’s weird how fast you get used to it.

When McDonald's opened in the Soviet Union for the first time, it had MASSIVE lines. It was a luxury good to eat there, but everyone wanted to experience what western food tasted like. At the time, McDonald's was far more expensive than local restaurants.

In 2000, I had a birthday in a Belarussian McDonald's. My family was from Belarus, and my parents returned from the US to visit their old friends/family for the first time since immigration. At the time, they were both really broke med students, completely on federal student loans. On my birthday, they invited like 40 of their friends to a Belarussian McDonald's and paid for everyone's food. At the time, it cost them the equivalent of less than $100. In Belarussian Rubles, this was overwhelmingly huge money - the equivalent of treating your friends as if you were a millionaire. After massive hyperinflation, they literally paid almost a million rubles for everyone's food.

Maybe that's one of the reasons that McDonald's still is so popular in Russia/Belarus. Sure, middle-class Russians can certainly afford far more now than they could after the '98-99 financial crash. But, the chain could still be seen as the premier place to get ""western"" or American cuisine.

(FWIW, I think Kentucky Fried Chicken is super popular there too, now. I visited Belarus almost three years ago and people loved KFC in Minsk.)",False,1646709731.0,t3_t92wld,t3_t92wld,,0,87,0,87,0,0,

Everyone is where they should be. I am in Kyiv. My team is with me. The territorial defense is on the ground. The servicemen are in positions. Our heroes! Doctors, rescuers, transporters, diplomats, journalists...   
  
Everyone. We are all at war. We all contribute to our victory, which will definitely be achieved. By force of arms and our army. By force of words and our diplomacy. By force of spirit, which the first, the second and each of us have.   
  
Take a look at our country today.   
  
Chaplynka, Melitopol, Tokmak, Novotroitske and Kherson. Starobilsk. Everywhere people defended themselves, although they do not have weapons there. But these are our people, and that's why they have weapons.   
  
They have courage. Dignity. And hence the ability to go out and say: I'm here, it's mine, and I won't give it away. My city. My community. My Ukraine.   
  
Every Ukrainian man and woman who protested against the invaders yesterday, today and will protest tomorrow are heroes.   
  
We shout at the invaders together with you. We stand in the squares and streets with you. We are not afraid with you when the invaders open fire and try to drive everyone away.   
  
YOU do not back down.   
  
WE do not back down.   
  
And the one who repeated: ""We are one people"" - certainly did not expect such a powerful reaction.   
  
In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there. And for Russia it is like a nightmare.   
  
They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now.   
  
Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. Odesa and Kyiv. Mykolaiv. Zhytomyr and Korosten. Ovruch. And many other cities.   
  
We know that hatred that the enemy brought to our cities with shelling and bombing will not remain there. There will be no trace of it. Hatred is not about us. Therefore, there will be no trace of the enemy. We will rebuild everything. We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia.   
  
Enerhodar. Chornobyl. And other places where barbarians just don't understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it.   
  
The Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary - can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object.   
  
Today in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it - to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that?   
  
Or to destroy another church - in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862.   
  
These are NOT people.   
  
There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors.   
  
Did it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian ""Grads"". Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol.   
  
They even destroy buses that have to take people out. But ... At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that's the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense.   
  
The third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say - the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace.   
  
Exactly to peace.   
  
We must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war.   
  
Apart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now ... You don't even mention them.   
  
Almost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move.   
  
I dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general - to move to a modern, transparent office - as befits a progressive democratic European country.   
  
Now I will say one thing: I stay here.   
  
I stay in Kyiv.   
  
On Bankova Street.   
  
I’m not hiding.   
  
And I'm not afraid of anyone.

Because it is very difficult after these meetings where we listen to the persistent lies and delusion and delirium coming from that particular country. 

I think that its not only the Russian diplomats in New York that need mental assistance, but also those who posted today this text:

>FM: Lavrov: The goal of Russia's special military operation is to stop any war that could take place on Ukrainian territory or that could start from there.

*Russian Embassy in London,* retweeted by the Russian embassy.

Did anyone else watch it? Thoughts?

A brief summary is he says Russia will not stop at Ukraine and the West (and US) need to realize that. He said it's the same as the 1940s when other nations said they were sorry a genocide happened but didn't stop it- he didn't think the same thing could happen again today. He thinks Biden can do more and hopes he can do more. Also noted that he's going to stay in Kyiv but didn't quite answer about staying until ""the end"" (meaning till death was how I interpreted the question), said he hopes for a ""Hollywood happy ending.""  He said (in English) that Americans need to do more than just use their words and take concrete actions to help but then ended the interview on a positive note saying he thinks we, as in Ukraine with the help of the world, will win. Other points were about the planes, he said was not naming the names of countries but they'd asked for planes and didn't get them, he also said the Ukrainian army is ultimately outmanned however there will always be an insurgency.

I'm mostly wondering if this is getting to the point where the US will have to step in more honestly. I definitely understand the arguments not to but it feels very inhumane to watch.

The grand prize is always Kyiv, and the consolidation is surrounding areas like Donetsk, Mariupol, Melitopol and everything along the coast, linking up Crimea.

Putin would declare victory for either, I feel. 

But it's really hard to see Russia extricating itself from this mess (that they started) this time just by unilaterally declaring some sort of victory, short of getting Kyiv and capture Zelensky.

The sanctions have picked up so much steam, they're not going to unwind for years. The conflict has also gained so much attention, Ukraine will not settle and give up any of its territories this time around. NATO wouldn't want it to, either, as Russian aggression is just too apparent at this point.

So, Ukraine have enough force to mount offensive? Does it try the long game and undermine (shouldn't be too difficult) any puppet governor p Putin sets up in those regions - but that means giving up their land for.

> Honestly, the only thing I can do now is to pray and cry.
> It would seem that there are obvious conclusions: no problem can be solved by war, people cannot be judged by their nationality. But why, in a few days, has the whole world rolled back into a state where every person has a choice between fear and hatred?
> I do understand that my problems are very insignificant compared to those of people in Ukraine, including my relatives who live there. The most important thing now is to stop the blood. All I know is that the spread of hatred will not help in any way, but only cause more suffering.

People are more focused on the conflict in Ukraine because:

1. Russia is a global super power and it invaded a sovereign European nation. This represents a huge threat to Europe and to America who has long viewed Russia as an existential threat.

2. Russia is a nuclear power - the largest in the world. Lots of people are really concerned that nuclear weapons could be used as this escalates. 

3. Russia has a lot of economic power and is tied up into the economies and trade of many countries. Conflict in Russia and Ukraine impacts the global economy far more than Yemen and Syria. 

4. The conflicts in Yemen and Syria are both Civil Wars, which means that other nations are reluctant to intervene and cause wider war. This also contributes to a feeling that we, the public, can't do much to help. 

5. Ukraine has really driven the narrative on social media, translating many of their videos and posts into English, and appealing directly to Europe and America. Stories like the Ghost of Kyiv (yes I know it's not real), Snake Island, etc are all creating viral moments online. They've even gone so far as to ask civilians around the world to come and fight for them. 

This doesn't mean that what's happening in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, etc isn't also massively concerning from a humanitarian perspective. It's just that most people don't view it as a threat to themselves or their way of life. Frankly, the war in Yemen and Syria aren't going to have a direct impact on most westerners, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine is certainly a massive threat to Europeans, Americans, and any democratic nation that values their sovereignty in the face of authoritarian aggression.",1646704939.0,1646704793.0,t3_t92wld,t3_t92wld,,0,164,0,164,2,0,

The all-out war did surprise many to start with. In my opinion, it is mainly due to the fact that Putin overestimated his military might and underestimated Ukrainian's willing to resist. He might as well underestimated his counterpart leading Ukraine, believing he is just a clown.

In Putin's calculation, if Russia could swiftly take over Kyiv and dismantle current government, he would have a lot of chips on the negotiation table to get what he wants most- internationally recognized Donbas and Crimea; downsizing of Ukrainian military and thus the de-facto control of East Ukraine.

To a certain extent, Putin must know he made a mistake. But his invincible image can't be broken back in Russia. He must get something to declare a victory and then go back to the negotiation table- using the only leverage he has- nuke and oil/gas exports to get as much as he could get out of it.

In brief, Putin is not a madman. He was overconfident and miscalculated. From now forward, more likely than not, he is calculating his cut-loss plan and exit game.",1646715675.0,1646711228.0,t3_t92wld,t3_t92wld,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Similarly for their pilots. They are using US made GPS Garmin in their cockpits!!! These pilots presumably put everything into their training.

Now, most of these interviews are a few years old, so I'm just curious if that assessment still holds up (it certainly did until recently). Does the unprecedented severity and universality of sanctions change the calculus for Putin? It seems he's trying to just do the same old story by coming down harder with censorship and such, but could it at some point change his approach, e.g., if Europe stops buying gas?

I wonder if Ukraine, Russia, EU and NATO would agree to something similar to the Sino-British Joint Declaration made for Hong Kong.

Basically, everyone agrees that Ukraine remains neutral for a certain number of years, 25-50. This allows Ukraine to continue, and pacifies Russia's security concerns for at least 25 years.

Biden too on this matter and it would seem [Draghi](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/any-eu-sanctions-russia-should-not-hit-energy-draghi-2022-02-18/) as well. I have no idea what macron and Johnson are thinking right now. Still at least there are still some adults in the room.

Energy price across the world have skyrocketed across the world. For those that don’t know in the United States has now reached 4 dollars a gallon! It hasn’t been this high since 2008! Demand recovering after the pandemic and fluctuations in supply have already caused prices to rise. Russia produces around a tenth of the world’s oil&gas. As Scholz said these Russian imports are of [essential importance](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-rejects-calls-for-banning-russian-oil-and-gas/) to the European economy.

Not only that, but If Europe and the U.S. decides to place sanctions on Russian energy then supply would crater. Oil&gas are incredibly demand inelastic products meaning that no matter what the supply of the product is the demand won’t change so price will naturally rise. **Again I repeat gas has hit 4 dollars a gallon in the U.S.** The price spiral will not just be contained in Europe. American producers will sell to Europe as supply drops and prices rise subsequently causing supply to drop and prices to rise here in the U.S.

This is especially worrisome because of the marginal utility of income it will the poorest of Americans and Europeans who will be hurt the most. They will have to spend a higher percent of their income on a product they need.

I don’t know about you guys, but I believe economic justice. Too often we tell our less fortunate to lift themselves up by the bootstraps and assign poverty as an individual moral failure. Now how can I possibly call sanctions on Russian gas&oil justice when it asks that the poor pay more money they do not have for a country that is not their own.

I’m glad we have adults like Biden, Scholz, and Draghi in power right now. No wonder it’s the usual troublemakers like Poland that have been screeching for sanctions on Russian energy. They have no idea the consequences of what they are advocating for. Hopefully one day we will move past the need for fossil fuels, but that is a long term goal. Right now leaders need to shield their people from these price shocks.

I’m not talking about the shoulder launch weapons, I’m interested in what’s been blowing the turret off of the tanks. Usually that’s only happens from a direct hit from another tank or large artillery.

Edit - a lot of people saying the Javelin missile can do that. Is there any documented source of this? Interested because they are intended to be surface to air, so it’s pretty surprising that they can get through any armor, even from the top where tanks don’t have much.

Edit 2 - after reading Wikipedia, which is never wrong, it says that they have 6lbs of high explosive, not a shaped charge. I doubt that would be able to penetrate the top armor at all. I work with people currently in artillery units, and they have only blown the turret off of tanks (practice, not combat) with a direct hit from a 155, which has about 23 lbs of high explosive.


Last edit- Thanks for the feedback. The NLAW is  an anti-armor weapon that I think a lot of people are confusing with the Javelin. Again, trusting Wiki, the NLAW is a high energy anti tank (HEAT) weapon designed to penetrate armor with a shaped charge. This will most certainly blow through the top of any turret.

Ok last edit for real, which country/ Javelin are we taking about? The British version is surface to air, but the American version is anti-tank, just like the British NLAW.",1646706204.0,1646704780.0,t3_t92wld,t3_t92wld,,0,-5,0,-5,0,0,

The German people have suffered too much. Mr. Chamberlain had an opportunity to make peace. The German nation is full of resentment at what has resulted.” 

“I have not broken my word. We do not recognize the existence of the Polish State. Germany has had a real awakening. What had been taken away from us has now come back to us. The German forces are inspired. Poland was never a democracy. It was comprised of peoples of different nations. 

“The last thing we desired was this bitter war against Poland. We have been condemned as barbarians, but the world will one day realize just how powerful the German people are and how patient they have been. Germany had a feeling that this day of reckoning would come. Other nations have besmirched our name. This could not go on.” 

“We wanted a peaceful settlement with England regarding Poland, and we hajve repeatedly begged for the preservation of peace. Prolonged discussions took place, but England constantly tried to force this position.” 

“Militarily and politically Germany is a great power. We must always be given credit for this. Poland had to be taught, and she was beaten. The morale of the Poles has been broken. Eighteen days ago, we decided to act, and we have harassed the poles with our might. Their army has been broken. We enforced right where injustices have been done. The German soldiers have been inspired by Devine right.”

“We will replace the Polish organization with a more intelligent one. People do not know the dirty indignities that had been perpetrated against us. It was almost bestial. The poor Germans had bene subjected to barbarous treatment. England would have nothing else, and cannot have anything else. My patience came to an end. We were determined to make it a blitzkrieg (lighting war).”

1. Russia can and will shell cities to rubble, killing hundreds of thousands.  They can hold cities hostage and wait to see what it will take to make Zelensky blink.  This is what they've done in the past in other places.  
2. They have a ton of soldiers and armor still in reserve in Russia that they can commit to the fight, although it will take them a while to get them to Ukraine.  The soldiers they do have in Ukraine are learning the hard way on what to do and what not to do, and sooner or later they'll get their shit together.  If they accomplish certain objectives like capturing railway terminals leading into Russia their fight will get immensely easier and the Ukrainians will have a MUCH harder time.  

The reasons people are hopeful is:

1. The sanctions are hitting HARD, the ruble has dropped by 50% already.  They have a matter of weeks before the earliest measures of the economic collapse become evident.  The ukrainians just have to hold out for a little while longer before Russia collapses internally.

On one hand the sanctions are supposed to weaken the overall economy and prevent Russia from supplying the war, but I’m worried about the effects it will have on the average Russian.  Most don’t support the war.  The sanctions and hatred towards Russia will only drive the average Russian into poverty and resentment of the rest of the world. Only Russians can stop Putin but people living paycheck by paycheck will NOT rise up against their government - their only focus is on living.  Only the rich and “middle class” have that luxury.  And those with a comfortable life probably aren’t going to rise up anyway.   If anything it will be easier to hire secret/riot police due to guaranteed income.  

Just look at North Korea.  Completely cut off from the world, many starving and in poverty yet they remain highly militarized and tests rockets all the time.  The poorer the citizens become the more power the government has over them. I don’t understand cutting Russian athletes/musicians/performers off from the rest of the world(unless they support Putin).  It doesn’t help sanctions… it’s done just to “send a message.”. Russian gamers are blocked from many online games and for what purpose? In hopes that they will rise up? I think there are ways we could be respecting the Russia people a bit more instead of demonizing the whole country.

I do believe that Russia sent some of their troops in without telling them where they were going or what they were going to do.

The Ukrainians, on the other hand, knew exactly what they were going to be doing.

If you don't have the mindset that you are probably going to die or be wounded, then you're putting yourself and your, I don't want to say comrades so..., battle buddies in danger. Any conflict has a chance of injury or death.

Now, imagine you literally thought you were going on military exercises and then your buddy gets shot in the face and the tank next to you blows up.

It's a huge difference in mindset but it makes for a world of difference. In the case where you know you're going to fight and you know you might die, you're prepared. You have the intestinal fortitude to keep going and do bad things to bad people. In the other case, you're getting emotionally gut punched. You aren't prepared at all.

Now, those troops who know what they're doing and are prepared. They're going into Ukraine and they're getting slaughtered. Going past your own burning equipment, seeing the bodies of the people on your side. That's tough. I've never had to do that, but I've stood in a burned out building after a riot and watched people get hit by rockets, they weren't my people, but you can't help to put yourself in their shoes.

You know that the people you're fighting are well-armed, determined, and that they HATE you. They don't dislike you, they loathe you and everything you stand for. This can make you want to fight harder, or it makes you more worried, more fragile.

I'd guess the Russians are, for the most part, the latter. And driving past their burning gear, destroyed equipment... that doesn't help. They know that their units were there and that they were destroyed. Yea, there can be some unit pride, like, ""those pansies in the 82nd got fucked up, we'll show them how to actually fight"" (nothing but respect for the 82nd btw) but a lot of that is bravado, not bravery.

So, yea, long story short, it would fuck up your morale.

Edit: when I was in, we would have done the latter thing here, and it would have been bravado, but we were also well trained, well equipped, and knew we could fuck shit up.

So far Russia has done poorly because their decision making has been very very very stupid.  So far there hasn't been any indication that will change, but there's no guarantee it won't.  Warfare has a way of weeding out incompetent leadership.

There's also a danger that by pronouncing that Russia is going to lose for sure that the feeling of urgency to keep Ukraine supplied will fall and weapons/support begins to slow down.  That would lead to a perverse situation where the prophecies are the opposite of self-fulfilling and Ukraine falls because the rest of the world didn't keep the pressure on.

Very interesting perspective.  

The reality is Russia is a bit player, a “gas station” to the western and globalized world.  Even if they better integrated into the west their poor demographics and fundamentally corrupt and impoverished position coming up from the 90s collapse would make it so they would never be much more than that.  Being the next Germany or China wasn’t in the cards through the global system.  But, if they could disconnect and blow up the global order and try a different path, maybe it could jump start them.  IMO it’s one of those risk reward moves, highly risky but with a tiny potential of success (imagine that Russia is its own world, resource wise it might be possible).  Or they could continue trying to win in the global system while everyone competes better than them.

Ruled by feudal lords while England was having a scientific revolution (as an island of course and devloping new principles of universalism such as Thomas Moore's Utopia). They have had it hard for millenia, and it's not our fault. I suspect it goes back to the issue of migratory populations -  they have always been harassed by invaders,  which led to the autocratic warrior mentality. The agressors being the  Monguls, Hun's and so on. People with no solid state but great capacity to disrupt,  ability for war - and no respect for their self defined land boundaries.

Basicaly,  there's these huge steppes where nomadic people amass without defined borders constantly sweeping through early civs. And tough as hell.  Idelogies of unification arise, and  are often the result of defense or imigration issues. Reconcilation or war against the invader. Usually the country and nomadic culture finds some principal of union if they swamp them, like proto-India, and invaders ""Indians"" or  Ayrians with natives, usually  around some kind of transcendent religious belief,  a cosmic One that includes all parties.  Such as Hundusim and succesors.

But Russian speaking peoples may have felt this threat so much,  that they couldn't develop a universalism earlier.  And the later ones they developed were immature responses. And more nationalistic than spiritual. Quasi spiritual,  in that the godhead is the state. Which is far more unstable,. The unifier needs to be more than the nation almost always and needs deeper underpinnings that are not reactive. Nationalism leads to conflict somewhere along the line without something more that transcends opposite civilisations, ethnic groups etc.

These things where formed in deep time. But of course they are humans too, so one part of the picture, and such long term factors apply to our mentality as well.",1646700671.0,1646698567.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzrvfnz,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

As such, the Rissians prioritized ammo over food and fuel which has forced the military to resort to ransackinh civilian establishments for supplies, further embroiled them in conflicts with civilians.

Many Russians believed they were liberators and did not expect civilians to be hostile. The first troop deployment expected to basically move to the capital unimpeded. They are often using paper maps, so the destruction of bridges and sinage has cause a massive logistics problem. Their missiles each require a truck to move to their lauching platforms. Unarmored supply trucks were destroyed by civilian resistance causing the first armor divisions to out run their supply lines. Fuel is now being moved by heavier armored Troup transports, so their armor is moving again, but the 40 mile stalled line of divisions is a massive logistics problem to untangle.

Net Pluses:
It’s an opportunity for a new detente with the west since there’s a new (old?) big bad on the block, and they might be able to extract some concessions (ending the trade war for example) *or* to extract as much as they could from Russia. China even conveniently has a somewhat legitimate claim of Vladivostok and Outer Manchuria since Russia took it from the Qing dynasty; in case of a total Russian collapse (unlikely) that might be something they can act on.

They can also be more conservative, which is far more likely, and try a balance act between Russia and the West. They’d try to keep Russia from collapsing and becoming a humanitarian disaster on its own, expanding its influence there while not enough to make the West mad or for Russia to triple down in the war and become a liability. If they could successfully help to end the war — say by brokering a peace between Russia and Ukraine using their influence, they would regain much of the goodwill and reputation lost in the last decade while gaining access to Russian resources.

Net Minus:

In any case a military invasion of Taiwan is immensely more risky now.

Either of those approaches can backfire. The West might refuse to grant any concessions to China and force its hand so it has to condemn Russia for basically nothing. In case of a total Russian collapse, Russia itself might become western aligned, making any move on them hard to execute. 

Even with a conservative approach, if Russian economy does collapse, it can become a severe drain on Chinese resources. A refugee situation might appear and China does not want to deal with it. It can also fail its balance act and lead to isolation from both Russia and the West.

Ukraine also contains a fair amount of Chinese investments and they were a military supplier for China before the war. There’s a high chance this relationship cannot be preserved and in either way China already takes a huge loss here.",False,1646703342.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzs3e4v,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

This movement was opposed by Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation, which argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian States had—but was part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede.""

Christian schism between the bishops of Rome vs Constantinople is one. This also resulted in a sort of considering the Byzantine emperors not true Christian emperors. The western kingdoms were at times jealous and also wary of the Byzantines. The 4th crusade shows that where they literally sacked Constantinople and establish a crusader state. 
Russia was within the eastern Orthodox sphere so where a bit outside what the medieval word considered Christiandom. Note the difference in religion and adopting the cyrrlic vs latin alphabet. 
Much of what we consider Russia was under the control of turkic steppe nomads for centuries before moscovy rose to power and eventually became more envolved in European politics in the early modern era. 
Finally, and the obvious one, is western powers hatred of the soviet idealogy (and more understandingly the authoritarian govt). Pre and post cold war habits die hard so here we are.

On some level I think Putin feels like he has no choice but to take Ukraine at this point, keep the border between him and the west as far from Moscow as he can. He's always been super paranoid about NATO/EU/Baltic League strengths. He's seen their existence as an insult and a threat from the beginning. It's clear he hoped to blitz Ukraine in a move of power so great that it leaves the west quaking, sets china up to conquer Taiwan, and establishes USSR 2: Nuclear Boogaloo.

On the other hand he has to realize the situation that he's putting himself in if he actually does try to see this through. This will be his second failure to blitz a much smaller military force, the first being when he failed to take all of Georgia and had to settle for a few regions. Nobody was looking back then, so he could hold his dignity, but this time everybody is watching how his military isn't up to the standard beheld of a so-called World Super Power. 

He's now stuck between his own ambitions and a western coalition setting to war against him. He's trying to hold onto that rope of ambition while holding off the wolves, but eventually one has to give. Either he gives up on Ukraine and loses the next war before it even starts, or he takes Ukraine and has to face down the next war with a massively weakened military, his people going into full revolt, with full knowledge that the only way he might be able to win is to try to go nuclear.

I feel like their insanely bad logistics they had fielding only 200,000 is going to be the same shitshow when they try to ramp up more troops.

Ukraine also has 80,000 to 160,000 foreign volunteers coming their way in addition to the 900,000 reserves they're in the process of mobilizing.

Considering two weeks in Russia has suffered this much loss with only 200,000 troops, I don't think they're in as good a place as their purely numerical advantage seems to suggest.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

They most likely planned to go down E95 Highway from Gomel in Belarus down through Chernihiv to Kyiv, which is the shortest and most direct route with the best roads. They got blocked in Chernihiv, tried to bypass it, got blocked again.

They then tried going from around Sumi West on the M9 highway, bypass Konotop but got stuck like 20 miles West of Konotop.

Out of desperation they got off the highway and went SW through the Ukrainian countryside and made lightning progress, dashing to the Eastern edge of Kyiv in like 2-3 days. But they got ambushed hard in 2 big ambushes near Sribne and Purluky and lost a decent amount of tanks. They then tried to consolidate their hold on that axis of advance by bringing more manpower to hold the towns and villages. They just lost a 6 tanker convoy near Purluky yesterday, that was precious fuel they needed.

Supposedly their combing through towns and confiscating cellphones, other rumors their literally just taking out cell towers or starting to jam them. They have been slowly bring up men and material to the villages just east of Kyiv but their struggling due to the distance from Sumi that they have to go.

The issue is their making progress going West on M9 the last 3 days and might not even need to cut through the country side. If they can get to Kipti, it's only a stones throw south on highway E95 to Kyiv and they would cut off Chernihiv. They could then encircle Chernihiv after cutting it off from Kyiv and allow them to take the E95 highway down from Belarus stopping at Chernihiv for a detour around it and then back on highway down to besiege Kyiv.

So they have to block the M9 highway push and their trying to do that, probably trading concentrating forces east of Kyiv to block the push through the country side for blocking their push down the M9 highway and keeping a lifeline to Chernihiv. Because if Russians have to attack East Kyiv, going SW all the from Sumi to East Kyiv is the worst way to do it due to a long stretched out logistics trail vulnerable to attack versus just going west on the M9 highway.",False,1646712359.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzsnd0c,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

In my opinion, it likely comes down to simple geography. Ukraine is a European nation and Ukrainians are fleeing into neighboring countries. I imagine there is some reluctance to accepting refugees from nations that are much further away, simply because they had other options along the way. 

[Here's a map.](https://geology.com/world/middle-east-map.gif)

Refugees from Yemen could go to Oman, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, or Egypt as a ""first"" stop. Obviously some countries are more preferable than others. 

Refugees from Syria could go to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, or even Armenia or Greece without traveling too far.


Now let's look at the map of [Ukraine](https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/ijq00q26hdu3l6mufiDVaDo3hc4=/735x0/EasternEuropeMap-56a39f195f9b58b7d0d2ced2.jpg) and [here are some of the latest refugee numbers by country.](https://twitter.com/deirdreheenan/status/1500798793385746433)

885,000+ refugees have gone to Poland, the country directly to the west of Ukraine. 

169,000+ refugees have gone to Hungary, the country bordering the southwest of Ukraine.

113,000+ refugees have gone to Slovakia, the country bordering the west of Ukraine, in between Poland and Hungary.

84,000+ refugees have gone to Moldova, the country bordering the southern side of Ukraine.

71,000+ refugees have gone to Romania, another country bordering the southern side of Ukraine.

Another 150,000 refugees have gone to other parts of the EU. 

So just using this sampling, only 10% of refugees went beyond the countries bordering their own, and almost all of them have remained in Europe (the region that Ukraine is part of) rather than trying to go to America or Asia, etc.

Also to be clear, the vast majority of refugees from Syria and Yemen are also fleeing into neighboring countries.",False,1646709379.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzsgx4m,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Many polls from many outlets including western ones that don't have a history of pro Russia bias in any way did show they were happy to be part of Russia. Crimea is very ethnically Russian and has many cultural and historical ties to the Russia federation. 

This same phenomenon was not the case in the Donbas regions. And it is certainly extremely far from the case in the rest of Ukraine. 

Crimea is more like Alaska and Donbas is more like, idk, Alberta I guess in terms of canada-US parallels for a sort of forced analogy.

 Or Donbas is more like Quebec to France maybe? They are seperate from country historically tied to (Russia/France) but share a language (Russian/French) but they are culturally distinct even though they borrow from the original country and have made their own culture. Ultimately they want to have some sense of independence and protections of minority language rights.

I think maybe that's a good comparison?

In the end I don't think we should act like Crimea's annexation is anything like this. Because the will of the Crimean people was mostly in line with Russia, but even in this conflict the eastern Ukraine regions still don't want to be invaded.

 >Brinkmanship (or brinksmanship) is the practice of trying to achieve an advantageous outcome by pushing dangerous events to the brink of active conflict. The tactic occurs in international politics, foreign policy, labor relations, contemporary military strategy (by involving the threat of nuclear weapons), and high-stakes litigation. The maneuver of pushing a situation with the opponent to the brink succeeds by forcing the opponent to back down and make concessions. That might be achieved through diplomatic maneuvers, by creating the impression that one is willing to use extreme methods rather than concede.

He said Moscow only would tap its nuclear arsenal if early warning systems spotted missiles heading toward Russia.

>“Only when we become convinced that there is an incoming attack on the territory of Russia, and that happens within seconds, only after that we would launch a retaliatory strike,” he said during a panel discussion at the forum.

>“It would naturally mean a global catastrophe, but I want to emphasize that we can’t be those who initiate it because we don’t foresee a preventive strike,” Putin said. “The aggressor should know that retaliation is inevitable, and he will be destroyed.”

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

That's the 95%-100% being discussed, not the total.  But that represents less than a quarter of Russia's active armed forces.  The rest are stationed at other bases or are not on active duty.  

Russia's painted this as a 'special operation' obviously for PR reasons, but it is backed by the germ of truth.  Putin deliberately wants to avoid declaring war, which would also trigger a mass mobilizaiton of all active and inactive troops.  It would put over 2 million support and combat soldiers at his disposal, but it would deny him the deniability he seems to think he still has with the general population.  Hence the conscripts and minority brigades at the beginning and the call for mercenaries now that the initial deployment has proved insufficient.  

If he exhausts these auxiliary groups, he'll have to either commit to a declared war he can't hide behind (as silly as that sounds), or withdraw.  Or find some some loophole to escalate it.  

I think it'll be option 3, but it'll be increasingly impossible to pretend half the shit he's fed his public about if that's the case.

Granted Russia has been especially moronic in how they've used them, but it does seem like the days of gulf war style armored columns and manoeuver warfare are numbered.

The major advantage of that kind of warfare was the mobility and protection of tanks made it easy for attackers to bypass prepared defences, sapping morale and leaving defenders constantly uncertain where the columns are headed and unable to get anti armor weapons to where they are needed.

There are two game changers over the last 20 years which have made that sort of warfare far less effective in this war-

- drones and access to real time satellite surveillance means it is far easier for defenders to track and predict column movements- particular if they are sticking to roads- so armored columns lose their biggest advantage.

- widespread use of man portable guided antitank missiles and offensive drones make it far easier for defenders to cause heavy losses when they do hit columns. The fact attackers aren't safe from drones when they stop overnight, and the fact that any infantry that get within 1-2 km of a battle tank can wreck it with a javelin really changes the value of a tank the same way barbed wire and machine guns made horse cavalry ineffective in WW1. Sure there are circumstances where they are still valuable but commanders are going to have to be far more careful about how and where they use them.

It's interesting to imagine what would happen if the american invasion of iraq was fought again with identical coalition forces and tactics to what they had in 2003 but with iraqi defenders who had access to large quantities of stingers, nlaws and javelins, and recon/offensive drones and satellite surveillance.

My guess is the US would have still won, thanks mainly to their far superior logistics  and better cooperation between their armor and  close air support than Russia, but their casualties, and APC and helicopter losses would have been far far higher- no way they would have got out of there with ~200 killed and wounded.",1646702245.0,1646702031.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzrsoby,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

But their is also another fear for Putin what I don't think he is seeing that well, civil war, even before a war with NATO or any other western countries he has to calm down Ukraine or if another war broke out Ukraine would likely fall into NATO's hands within a few weeks forcing them back due to that Ukrainians have proven that they will not go quietly and prefer going down in a fight, starting a war with NATO would push civilians to raise again if they should fall during this war.

This is a reason why I think after Ukraine he will go quiet for a while, he will need to build up his troops and try to restore his economy on top of that try to get control over Ukraine and ensure civil war won't happen, but at the same time this war could have some effects on the west, it is possible due to fear especially in Eastern Europe what are so close to the war, these countries will start building up more military forces making the west even stronger.

 >Fragging is the deliberate killing or attempted killing by a soldier of a fellow soldier, usually a superior officer or non-commissioned officer (NCO). The word was coined by U.S. military personnel during the Vietnam War, when such killings were most often attempted with a fragmentation grenade, sometimes making it appear as though the killing was accidental or during combat with the enemy. The term fragging is now often used to encompass any means used to deliberately and directly cause the death of military colleagues.

There's a lot that goes into it.  The launch vehicles themselves require meticulous maintenance and upkeep, as many of the avionics and parts are very much the same kind of thing you'd use in an orbital rocket (though US ICBMs use solid fuel rather than the traditional liquid-fuel; more similar to a Shuttle SRB).   Solid fuel and engines are far simpler and more ""solid state,"" or reliable, but that's only a single component of a sophisticated launch system.  Keeping any kind of rocket in a state of readiness with an expectation of reliability at any time requires constant inspection by trained experts that actually know what they're looking at, and that in and of itself is expensive.

&#x200B;

But on top of that, the warheads themselves are very delicate and complex.   Nuclear warheads aren't like traditional chemical explosives that are inherently volatile and can explode at a moment's notice.  In fact, that's why US attempts to put them in a ""bunker busting"" type weapon failed; because that sort of impact just *ruined* them.    What causes a nuclear explosion is a very precise sequence orchestrated by a number of parts, and many of those parts (such as the radioactive fuel or conventional booster charges) degrade over time and need maintenance.   The mechanisms themselves require similar care.  If, when attempting a detonation, anything is off or the timing isn't right or the charges are too degraded, the explosion may be orders of magnitude less than rated, or may not even happen at all.

&#x200B;

In general, everything about an ICBM is something you can't just stick in a silo, and forget about.    Every part of them, from the launch vehicles to the warheads themselves, to even things I haven't talked about like the targeting and guidance systems, require constant care by professionals.   Any of these things not working as intended can result in a failed launch, a launch that goes off course, that can't boost all the way up to the terminal phase, or reentry vehicles/warheads that don't deploy or detonate as intended.   It really *can't* be half-assed, which is why only a handful of countries even know how to do it all reliably.",False,1646702086.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzs1db2,,4,11,0,11,0,0,

I totally agree that if he takes Ukraine the citizens will wage an IRA style civil war. There's already that kind of action happening, a few days ago a video of citizens doing a drive by with molotovs against a russian tank unit made the rounds on Reddit.

It will be Putin's equivalent of the Vietnam war if he takes Ukraine. A terrible tragedy, one that I have no doubt will ultimately throw his people into rebellion. Both Russians and conquered Ukrainians. Autocrats only have one way out of the throne when they fuck up.

The military is only so effective when turned on their own people. Russian soldiers already don't seem to like invading Ukraine. I have little doubt that Putins already middling military power would diminish as people deserted rather than turn against their own people.

And the sanctions from the west will only increase. The russian economy relies remarkably on the west buying their exports. Maybe China and a few other places that depend on Russian imports, or have political ties, will still buy from them, but it won't be enough.

The only way for Russia to recover economically is to pull out of Ukraine, and help rebuild. The longer the war goes on, and if Putin starts to succeed, he will drive his economy to North Korean levels of isolation, which will be entirely unsustainable for a country of that size.

Eventually this will undo Putin's Russia if he wins. I don't think he was ready for the west to turn on him so quickly, which is why he keeps bluffing against the west. He's terrified of an isolated Russia right now. Left alone, with no money coming in from the west to pay his military to fight a foreign or domestic war, he has no hope of holding his ambitions together when it's clear that this will be the only step he's allowed to take, and it has been like stepping on needles.",1646709037.0,1646708330.0,t3_t92wld,t1_hzs7wlm,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

They do zero training, they don't have a unit or job. Mobilizing them this late to try to get them into any sort of actual fighting force for *offensive* operations is going to be very slow at best.

----------

Anyway, you should go look at the actual distribution of those military forces. Even with a very charitable view where everyone in certain groups is a front-line soldier, they have no more than around 350k troops actually suited for ground combat. (Ground Forces, Airborne/VDV, Naval Infantry)

Telling the ship mechanic ""you're an infantryman now, good luck!"" is not going to go very well.

They're also obviously not going to leave the entire rest of the country literally undefended, and certainly aren't going to leave the occupations in Georgia, the Kurils, or Nagorno-Karabakh undefended either. So the real number is lower than that.

Once corporate lobbying and financial interests interfere, the moral compass of the average politician is thrown out the window. The lack of actual boots on the ground going on in Ukraine is largely due to the fact that the general consensus is no one wants another world conflict, a lot of people stand to lose money in the event of another war time era hitting the globe. 

Just getting on board for renewables when a crisis hits is not a way to start and maintain a global supply of energy. 

We've been talking about this for 20 years but now Russia has a strangle on western Europe and, at the expense of the consumer for an undetermined amount of time, now we see the determination for said renewables. 

I wish the world was different and I wish people weren't corrupted so easily.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

Only the insane do the same things over and over again expecting different results. Russian leadership may be stupid, but they aren't insane. If you and I sitting in front of our keyboards can see that they have a logistical problem then the Russians can see it, too.

That's why we're seeing armored trains(!) and Russians impressing civilian transport into supplying their forces. The Russians knew they were going to have supply problems before the war even started, but they invaded anyways on the assumption that the Ukrainians would welcome their new Russian overlords, or at least they'd be able to blitz the capital and several of the major cities if they decided to resist.

That was a mistake and they're paying for it.

Don't expect them to make the same old mistakes over and over again. Humans adapt, even blissfully ignorant ones in the Kremlin. The Russians are looking for solutions to the problems given to them by the Ukrainians, and they have a *lot* of equipment they can use to experiment.

>	The writer is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University

>Of all the sanctions the west imposed on Russia last week, sanctioning Russia’s central bank is by far the most fateful. “We will cause the collapse of the Russian economy,” said Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister. This is not hyperbole. And if managed smartly by the west, these sanctions can also stop the war in Ukraine and beyond.

>The possibility stems from an unsung feature of any modern central bank. The Russian central bank is, like others, not only the lender of last resort to commercial banks in its domestic currency, the rouble, but also the lender of last resort in foreign exchange. FX reserves support the exchange rate and the value of the rouble, ensure the stability of the banking system and its deposits, prevent runs on banks, bail out the foreign debt of state and private corporations and manage the sovereign wealth fund.

>Western sanctions strike at these foundations of the Russian economy. And this has become possible because of the digitalisation of international finance.

>Unlike in times past, most components of FX reserves are not physical certificates of government bonds or piles of cash in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. In the 21st century, they are electronic book entries on the computer ledgers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the European Central Bank, European national central banks, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and Swiss commercial banks.

>This digitalisation separates ownership and control of FX reserves. Russia owns them but western issuers and computerised holders of these assets control access to them. At the end of February, they collectively closed Russia’s access to these assets, froze them and banned all private transactions with the Russian central bank so that it cannot sell securities and cannot withdraw cash from western banks. From a source of economic strength during peacetime, FX reserves turned into the source of a crash during war.

>Within a fateful 24 hours, the Russian central bank and Russians lost access to 60 per cent of FX reserves, $388bn out of a total $643bn. They lost access to entire arrays of assets: securities and deposits in western central banks ($285bn) and in western commercial banks and brokerages ($103bn). The Russian central bank is left with $135bn worth of gold in its vaults, $84bn of Chinese securities denominated in renminbi, a $5bn position in the IMF and a residual $30bn in actual cash, dollars and euros. (These are my calculations from central bank data).

>With 60 per cent of FX reserves out of commission, Russia has to rely on the remaining 40 per cent, but there is no freedom to operate there either. The central bank cannot sell gold for dollars and euros because all transactions with it are prohibited and foreign bankers and dealers do not want to invite western wrath. The IMF reserve position is untouchable. Some $84bn in Chinese securities could, hypothetically, have been sold back to China, with a discount, to be paid in dollars, cut to $50bn, but China’s state banks have already refused financial deals with Russia. Which leaves only $30bn in cash — too little to prevent financial and economic ruin.

>The rouble is already in freefall and the run on banks in full swing. Russian corporate and individual depositors have $280bn in dollar and euro denominated account balances with Russian commercial banks. Banks cannot have that much foreign cash on hand and the central bank doesn’t have cash to save them. Now people want to withdraw rouble deposits, not because they are afraid that next time the roubles won’t be there but because they expect that next time their bank won’t be there. The Russian people saw bank failures during the default of 1998 and expect no less.

>The final implosion will be over supply chains. Businesses will demand dollars for payments. The successful part of the economy, producers of natural resources and high-value goods, will operate in dollars. The rest will have to resort to barter and endure supply interruptions, work stoppages and unemployment. The government may ban foreign currency transactions and demand that businesses trade only in roubles. This is unenforceable. The economy will break and a GDP contraction follow.

>These developments will weaken the Russian war effort but, alas, may not be sufficient to stop the war. But something else may. The west can offer the Russian government a deal: cash for peace. This is akin to the IMF practice of conditional loans. The west has frozen $388bn in Russian assets. We can offer to unfreeze assets in tranches, say, $50bn a piece to save their economy in exchange for withdrawing forces from Ukraine, pledging not to ever use nuclear weapons and, generally, starting a return to humanity.
