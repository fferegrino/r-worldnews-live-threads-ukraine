That doesn't make any sense.

Starlink uses beam forming to make a very narrow cone of energy from the flat panel dish, so you have to be virtually directly between it and it's destination to get a strong detection. Plus, due to the low orbit of Starlink satellites, they are constantly moving relative to the ground. This means you can't have a helicopter randomly get a signal detection and then double back on its course to get it again because by the time you do, the Starlink dish is pointing it's beam in a completely different direction.

Even if the Satcube antenna have the same sort of narrow beam, the fact that they point at a geostationary satellite means they always point at the exact same spot in the sky, so doubling back can allow you to find them far easier than with Starlink.

Meanwhile jamming doesn't have anything to do with the altitude of the target satellite directly. If anything, a geostationary satellite will have more problems because all russia would need to do to ""jam"" it is point a dish of their own straight at it from the front and just blast it with energy. Since it doesn't move, the jammer is set-and-forget.",False,1691565566.0,t3_15m49n7,t1_jverrnf,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Things are moving slowly, because of a huge combination of factors.

Public approval regarding actions that cost money; that matters a lot to democracies.  If it starts to cost too much, if we have to raise taxes to support Ukraine, the entire big business community that doesn't benefit from war spending will be up in arms, turning media companies against the government's course of action.  They have to feather the throttle, because resources are in fact, finite.  We can't borrow vast sums of money at 1% APR anymore.

He's extremely risk-averse, to the point that he indirectly causes worse outcomes by avoiding all risk over the short-term.  He's going to slow-walk everything.

Things move slowly, because western weapons systems are just giant paper weights unless you have soldiers that know how to operate them.

It makes sense if you consider the [Friis transmission formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_transmission_equation).  The power received is proportional to the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP = P_t G_t) times the inverse of the distance squared.

P_r = P_t G_t (λ/4πr)² 

Starlink has a much shorter altitude (r) that is 550 km versus 35,000 km for geosynchronous as well as beam forming for a higher gain (G_t).  However the Satcube compensates by significantly increasing power, while decreasing the bandwidth.  This results in a superior [E_b/N_0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eb/N0) which makes the received Satcube signal more resistant to jamming than Starlink.

In short, Starlink attempts to significantly reduce on-board power while maximizing bandwidth, which requires a large constellation of satellites providing spot-coverage at a low altitude.  The Satcube approach is a single high-power, low-bandwidth geostationary satellite.  The US has a commercial version of this called INMARSAT.",1691567090.0,1691566838.0,t3_15m49n7,t1_jvev60e,,2,40,0,40,0,0,

It can only achieve gains if Russia ignores it, which for now, appears to be the case, but those gains could easily be lost if Russia were to flood the area with troops.

Yes, you can make up this margin with lower bandwidth, but this scales (inverse) linearly with IBW, versus the square of propagation distance.  Starlink satellites also use active beamforming on both ends, which I doubt is being done from geo sats.  Lower IBW per watt also makes the detection margins less favorable, and only really improves J/S against naive jammers.  It is also relatively easy to just attack and saturate the transponder of a geo satellite with your own enormous aperture, from anywhere within the (much larger) spot beam.  The thing which makes starlink so hard to jam is that the beams have a small footprint, so transponder attacks are quite difficult.       
  
I have been working in this field for a while, and I am pretty skeptical of these claims as well.

But don't you get an advantage on the receiving side when the incoming (jamming) energy isn't coming from the direction you're intending to listen to? (Given the beam steering nature of the array.)

I suppose the more pertinent thrust of my first post is, wouldn't the functionally static position of the Satcube in geostationary orbit mean that a russian antenna could (somewhat locally) overwhelm it's receivers to within the angular resolution of the satellites receivers to ignore signals off to the side?

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG-7

>A 1976 U.S. Army evaluation of the weapon gave the hit probabilities on a 5-by-2.5-metre (16.4 ft × 8.2 ft) panel moving sideways at 4 m/s (8.9 mph). Crosswinds cause additional issues as the round steers into the wind; in an 11 km/h (6.8 mph) (3 m/s) wind, firing at a stationary tank sized target, the gunner cannot expect to get a first-round hit more than 50% of the time at 180 m

That sounds bleak.  However, higher up in the article it gives the lethal radius of 7m against body armor for the fragmentation.  Six rounds of 7m radius in a hexagon kills everything in a 10m radius plus a bunch if stuff nearby.

The F16 won’t change anything drastically, at least not in the short term.

The country is saturated with AA-threats to which the F16 really isn’t exceptionally better equipped to deal with than their current fleet.

Satellite Internet is usually through a single satellite covering about an entire hemisphere for thousands to tens of thousands of customers or even more simultaneously from what I understand.
