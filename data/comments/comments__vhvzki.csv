He told the people that the government would not let them fall.

Note: Czechs are getting pretty uncomfortable, shit's getting expensive and they are getting spammed by Russian propaganda. Overall, the mood is good and the population is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian. Still, it was a good timing on Fiala´s side.

Today it was not much better than yesterday, shelling still continues, and it is still very deadly. They killed 10 people in Kharkiv’s oblast today. What is even the point, to make people fear them? That won’t work then, what it does is make everyone here hate them with passion, and this hate won’t disappear for generations.

I don’t think that they understand what kind of war this is. They can’t hide their crimes from anyone this time. It’s one thing when it’s something like Holodomor, where you can read about it in a book, most likely with not many photos (if any) from that time period. But it’s a completely different thing when you can, not just read about their crimes, but literally see them caught on videos and photos.

They think that the war will end, and everyone will just forget about it after some time, as if nothing ever happened, but it’s different this time. Even 100 years into the future anyone will be able to just see this war for themselves, documented by the regular people, not some government, it will be on the internet forever, and they won’t be able to hide it.

“It’s a heavyweight boxing match. In 2 months of fighting, there has not yet been a knockout blow. It will come, as RU forces become more depleted,” he said.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 22 June 2022
 


- Heavy shelling continues as Russia pushes to envelop the Sieverodonetsk area via Izium in the north and Popasna in the south. Russia is highly likely preparing to attempt to deploy a large number of reserve units to the Donbas.

- The Russian authorities have not released the overall number of military casualties in Ukraine since 25 March. However, the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) publishes casualty figures for DPR forces. As of 16 June, the DPR acknowledged 2128 military personnel killed in action, and 8897 wounded, since the start of 2022. The DPR casualty rate is equivalent to around 55 per cent of its original force, which highlights the extraordinary attrition Russian and pro-Russian forces are suffering in the Donbas. It is highly likely that DPR forces are equipped with outdated weapons and equipment. On both sides, the ability to generate and deploy reserve units to the front is likely becoming increasingly critical to the outcome of the war.

The arrival of Western weapons begins to reshape the battle off Ukraine’s coast.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/world/europe/recent-ukrainian-strikes-in-black-sea-suggest-it-has-received-powerful-western-weapons-analysts-say.html)



KYIV, Ukraine — As Ukrainian forces launch a renewed assault on Snake Island in the Black Sea, recent strikes suggest that they are using powerful Western anti-ship weapons in an effort to undermine Russian naval domination.

The Ukrainian military’s southern command said late on Tuesday that it was using “various forces and methods of destruction” to attack Russian infrastructure on Snake Island, a speck of land south of Odesa that is critical to efforts to control the Black Sea. On Wednesday morning, the military said it had destroyed a Russian air defense system, radar installation and vehicles on the island.

Russia’s defense ministry said it had thwarted the attack, which it said had featured 15 drones and long-range missiles, and was intended to land Ukrainian soldiers on the island. “The unsuccessful fire attack forced the enemy to abandon the landing to Snake Island,” the Russian military said.

The Russians said that “after being convinced that the attempt to seize the island had failed,” the Ukrainians had used long-range anti-ship missiles and drones to attack Russian gas infrastructure facilities in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.

The details of the battle offered by the two sides could not immediately be verified. But Ukrainian officials defended the targeting of Russian offshore drilling infrastructure, saying that Moscow was converting its drilling platforms to military installations by installing high-tech surveillance and communications systems on the rigs.

The current round of fighting around Snake Island appeared to kick off on Friday, when the Ukrainians struck a Russian naval tugboat as it was on a mission to deliver weapons and personnel to the island.

On Tuesday, the British military’s intelligence agency said that Ukraine had “almost certainly” used newly delivered Harpoon missiles in the attack — their first demonstrated use. Ukrainian coastal defense capabilities have now “largely neutralized” Russia’s ability to project maritime force in the northwestern Black Sea, the British analysis said.

Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, said that Ukrainian weapons had hit a former natural-gas rig on Monday where Russian forces had placed radio-jamming equipment, blocking Ukraine from getting an accurate picture of the area. Mr. Zagorodnyuk said the strikes might be an indication that important naval weapons Ukraine has been seeking from its Western allies had arrived.
The Russians said that the Ukrainian attack on the drilling rig had resulted in an intensive fire and could lead to “an environmental disaster.”

The strikes at sea come amid an intensification of bombardment across southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has reported more than two dozen Russian missile attacks in recent days. Serhii Bratchuk, the spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration, said a Russian missile barrage on Odesa on Monday had struck targets including a food warehouse and a cemetery.

As both sides duel in the Black Sea, the world is wrestling with a global food crisis caused by a Russian naval blockade that is keeping Ukrainian ships from leaving port with millions of tons of grain.

Snake Island — which covers just 46 acres of rocks and grass — is vital to both the Ukrainians and the Russians. If the Russians have control of the island 180 miles off the coast of Odesa, they can control shipping lanes in the northwestern corner of the Black Sea.

After a series of attacks in May by Ukrainian forces in and around Snake Island, Russia has reinforced its outpost there with multiple surface-to-air rocket systems, according to satellite imagery and Ukrainian officials.

Mr. Bratchuk said the Russians were trying to turn the garrison on the island into “something that could be the analogue of the warship Moskva.” The Ukrainians sank the Moskva, the flagship on the Russian Black Sea Fleet, in April. Although at that time Ukraine had a handful of domestically made anti-ship missiles, called Neptunes, powerful Harpoon systems appear now to be arriving in the country from the West.",1655906798.0,1655906606.0,t3_vhvzki,t3_vhvzki,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

>1. **Russian messianic mindset** - Russia has an inherently messianic view of its own role in the world. Russia believes it is the center of Christianity and its true standard-bearer ever since the collapse of the Byzantine Empire. This messianic thinking manifests itself in a variety of ways, such as seeing themselves as the leaders of pan-Slavism and, in the 20th century, as leaders of the global world communist movement. Various movements but all with the same core view of themselves as better.

>2. **No knowledge of democracy** - Russia has never had a true experience with democracy. At best, only ever a minority of Russians have known it and even fewer understood it. When given the chance, Russians always take the subservient (serf) role to the state/Tsar.

>3. **Different concepts of morality** - The West has and continues to mistake Russian morality. russia has a different concept of morality that simply cannot be measured by the standards of modern democratic societies... Russia will always act Macchiavelian, will always lie, and will always take advantage of others in any situation (often times not even for a better outcome for themselves but purely for the sake of 'winning'). And Russians see no problem with this predatory view.

>4. **Security paranoia** - Russia is always paranoid about its own geographical security, even as it has been expanding continuously and aggressively for nearly 500 years. An old Russian saying goes ""our borders are only safe when our soldiers stand on both sides of them"".

>5. **Inferiority complex** - Russia has always been technologically and developmentally behind most of the rest of the world. Other than St. Petersburg and Moscow, it is part of the developing world. This drives deep resentment among Russians which is a core part of their psychology.

>6. **Suspicion** - Russia looks at the rest of the world with deep suspicion and skepticism. russia will always feel the victim even as it has relentlessly and aggressively colonized dozens and dozens of states and cultures for centuries.

I hope those naive illusions are gone now. Disarming democracies doesn't magically make authoritarian states also disarm. We've seen that when authoritarian states like Russia see an opening, they're very happy to invade, destroy, rape, pillage, massacre to get their way and try to destroy democracy. Imagine if we hadn't expanded NATO to the baltic states and stationed NATO forces in bases there, as some apparently would have preferred, where would we be now? What would've stopped those states much smaller and weaker than Ukraine from being bullied or invaded?

Like anyone I want to see as much peace as possible, I'll always support diplomacy first and I want to see a world without war or weapons and armies at all, ideally.

A feature of the conflict in recent weeks has been the military stalemate that has developed - and Vladimir Putin's apparent inability to impose a strategy that will give Russia a definitive upper hand.

Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies King's College London, has released an essay this morning which suggests the president's relative inaction is a reflection of the ""gradual erosion"" of his authority in Moscow. 

""It is now widely assumed in the West that he will not back down in the war with Ukraine and, if things go badly, he will lash out,"" he writes.

""Such a man must not be provoked. Yet the image is starting to fray at the edges. Behind all the braggadocio his power is slowly eroding.

""The symptoms of this are to be found not in a readiness to compromise on the war, which remains absent, but instead in a policy paralysis, pressing on with his established strategy because he can think of nothing better to do.""

He goes on to say that recent developments in the conflict - including Mr Putin's speech last week in St Petersburg and the current flashpoint with Lithuania over Kaliningrad - ""fits in with the gradual erosion of Putin's authority in Russia"".

""Russian elites are struggling to come to terms with a war that Putin began without consultation and which he does not know how to end on favourable terms,"" he says.

""He is unwilling to take the even greater risks required to secure a military victory (assuming that these could succeed) yet unable to accept anything that would look like a defeat.""

Professor Freedman said ""no one amongst the elite has a clue how to escape this conundrum or, even if they did, has the political courage and opportunity to move against Putin"" - meaning a coup to overthrow him was unlikely.

And he concludes that the entrenched position of both Russia and the West means a paralysis in the conflict is unlikely to be disrupted any time soon. 

""...Russia is now facing the possibility that it really has bitten off more than it can chew,"" he says.

""None of this means an early end to the war. Nor does it mean that things will get easier for Ukraine.

""Putin's default strategy is always to inflict pain even if he can achieve little else. The risk of more reckless action cannot be precluded.

""Nonetheless we should not assume that Russia is inexhaustible or, just because we cannot pick a winner in the battle at the moment, that the war is destined for a prolonged stalemate.""

* early on in the war, like really early on, Russia set up artillery about 15 miles from the Polish border (also very close to Lviv but nobody mentioned that.) Fear-mongers said that this meant there was a real serious threat of Russia attacking Poland. Look how that turned out.

* early on during the first round of negotiations, a Russian spokesperson said ‘the future of Russia is at stake’ at that point in the war. Fear-mongers said that this was to be used as a justification for the imminent use of tactical nuclear weapons on Ukraine. Look how that turned out.

* early on in the war, Putin famously ‘put his nuclear deterrents on high alert.’ Although this was clearly bullshit, fear-mongers went APOPLECTIC over this, saying that a nuclear exchange was imminent. Look how that turned out.

* a month or so into the invasion, there were reports of chemical attacks in Ukraine. Fear-mongers said that this was going to be a red line for NATO and that NATO were going to intervene.

* a ton of people were playing up May 9th as the date where there’d be a major and worrying advancement in the war. People laughably bought into these fake ads for ‘conscription supervisors’ on Russian websites that were posted on Twitter. All for naught, of course. Look how that turned out.

One should re-check one's assumptions. (ie. maybe Putin is not really a monolithic dictator 100% in control - Putin is actually irrelevant, because what we're dealing with is a Nationalistic Cult, with a broad consensus on national strategy. It's Putin. It's an inner-circle of elites and military leaders. It's oligarchs. It's their political-academics. They're all deeply invested in a Russia with Imperial/Expansionist agenda).  It's convenient for Russia to project a single-human-personality onto the aggregate national behavior. But that's not a good fact-based model for what's actually happening.

This narrative that Putin is ""unstable"" and ""may lash out"" serves Putin's interest: because it helps him to further leverage his nuclear weapons stockpile to intimidate the west to get what he wants. It not only weakens the alliance of the west, but it draws out the conflict and causes more needless suffering (and drives up the economic costs that everyone is going to have to bear, in order to sustain this war). 

This ""Putin is irrational"" narrative is only an assumption; with no basis in-fact. It may be true. But it's equally likely that it is NOT true. And while it's a possibility that must be considered, it is also dangerous and stupid to just go along with this assumption as if it's fact.

The other consideration is that in either case: (putin is rational, or putin is not rational), Russia has only demonstrated that they will back down when forced. Therefore, more force must be applied.  Therefore, heavy weapons MUST be supplied to Ukraine to the highest level physically possible. 

>Putin's default strategy is always to inflict pain even if he can achieve little else.

I agree with this statement, and it's clear that even if Russia is forced-off of Ukrainian territory to pre-2014 borders; Russia will continue to harass Ukraine, probably with missiles. It's an Israel/Palestine situation all over again - which is a conflict that has sustained for more than 50 years. Only in this case, Russia has nuclear weapons and advanced cruise missiles.  

Either the west must inflict intolerable pain against Russia; or the west must disarm Russia (remove this remote missile-strike capability from them). The only other alternative is to allow Russia to continually wage this war on Ukraine indefinitely.",1655908883.0,1655908656.0,t3_vhvzki,t1_idayt11,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Now that Russia is at war with NATO in Ukraine, any Russian that comes to power will see this as an existential conflict.

From Obama era ambassador:

“Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin’s sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.”

Then the Sandia US national energy laboratory did a geothermal-technology initiative to see if they could come up with inventions that could help it work better. And they did! They invented new drilling technologies that let us drill much, much, deeper, and hotter, than we ever could before. The oil industry snatched that technology up almost immediately, and are using it today. But the skepticism among investors remained.




One big advantage with geothermal is that, as we move away from fossil-fuels, we’ll still have all of that old oil-well drilling equipment and expertise, and there isn’t much difference in drilling a geothermal hole or an oil hole. Energy companies should like that. Halliburton should be able to transition in to a clean-energy infrastructure company without too much trouble.

For example, reports by ISW that Russians are starting to be able to nullify drones on the eastern front, which has been one of Ukraine's top advantages

edit: while I'm here a question if anyone has knowledge of this. On Amazon there are drones that are larger than the usual playthings and only a couple hundred bucks, maybe $500 for some. Presumably they are not designed to minimize radar signature as much as the expensive military drones, so would still be picked up by radar. I have no idea how much a SAM missile by itself counts... But is it a crazy idea to send thousands of these to Ukraine? Either they actually get info or they waste a SAM missile for basically nothing (also I get it, they are probably not short on these missiles, but I imagine a missle designed to be able to stay tracked on an evasive state of the art jet, surely they can't be cheap.

This is the part I'd consider biased. Both calling it a semi-war but also that there's some long list of American weapons underperforming.

But like you said, I've also read about Ukrainians preferring other commercial drones to them because they have longer range + recon and more effective to use something that's not a one-way trip + can use anti-tank grenades + easier for people to train on and get good on and so on.

The switchblade seems like something that was designed to be a fancy frag grenade and probably to exist in a scenario where commercial drones would be shot down instantly but as we know that's not the case so the 300 just seems very missmatched to what Ukraine needs + too cumbersome.

What hurts it from working in America is because it's done by local municipalites and they pay a fraction of the value of the firearm.

Security paranoia, gun distribution, police ineptitude/corruption and the biggest military budget by far. I would say the US qualifies.

They're corrupt, weak and with illusions of grandeur, the very fact that Putin stands in his role for so long, shows just how fragile it is politically. 

But this has less to do about culturally predepositioned to being a serf, and rather an result of historical events. 

A disillusioned and troubled population can be incited or lead in any nation or region, by anyone who hits the flow of the wave correctly. For Trump it was the anti-establishment groundswell which he managed to ride upon. For Putin it was positioning himself to replace a controversal figure, at a time when the economy came back on track and his government reacting to events sufficiently to consolidate power. 

Much like how Hitler hit a wave and rode it with numerous unexpected political victories, his opponents were silenced and opposition crushed. And the german people all seemed united behind him, and his actions were seen as acts of a 3D chess player. Until it didn't, until it was undisputed that the british still managed to blockade Germany as in the first world war. That he failed in invading the Soviet Union, that the US were not kept out of the war. 

Now we're seeing the same with Putin, he went too far, his great 3D chess, was simply reactions to an evolving situation. Puddle deep in complexity, and with effects outside their calculations. 

Russia's economic policy was the first mistake, their acceptance of corruption from the very top to the bottom. Their ambitions militarily on both the seas and land, a decent second mistake. Their political manouvering in foreign affairs, poisonings, use of military brute force in internal and border affairs, a third mistake.

But i digress, their biggest and most monumental geopolitical mistake, was integrating Crimea into Russia. It seemed like a ''win - win'', Russia removed a historical mistake, and the political leadership got popular on the basis of their grand victory.

But their national security was in the worst spot since 1917, their objectively most important former Soviet Union member state, had been carved pieces of land from, and turned from a friendly alinged bufferstate to an military opponent. And soon NATO planes would be flying in Ukrainian airspace. This had no easy fix, either as the damage was done, Ukraine was now lost forever.

And so they needed to ''fix it'' and military power was their go to tool. And now, they're in even a worse spot than ever before. This all caused by the political leadership, shaped by an leadership culture which weakened their decisionmaking, and consequently still surprises us with how inept they are in calculating the effects of their own actions.",False,1655903296.0,t3_vhvzki,t1_idar1hm,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

How do you reach a compromise with a country that says your nationality doesn't exist, that you've been brainwashed to believe you're not bulgarian, that your language is made up and what you're actually speaking is a form of bulgarian.

What should we call ourselves instead of macedonians then? North Macedonians? West Bulgarians? Bulgarians? What about our language? West Bulgarian? Bulgarian? Should we then switch to Bulgarian as an official language?
If we are Bulgarians speaking Bulgarian, does that give Bulgaria the right to invade and occupy (read liberate) us?

The one they are building in Germany is similar to a household Geothermal HVAC.  It's grabbing the heat from the ground water, and then sending the heat out to the homes, probably as steam.  It's highly efficient but has a big limitation.  Some cities were designed with distributed steam heating systems, with a central coal/gas furnace producing the steam.  That centralized plumbing to every building in town has to be preplanned.  It's not something that can be ~~easily~~ cheaply added to a town.  And over a wide area the steam would lose most of it's energy, so it doesn't work in suburbs or rural areas.

The Nevada system converts the energy to electricity at the plant.  Then it can be distributed over a much wider area.  But in that situation you end up losing power to the conversion from heat to electricity then back to heat.

Taiwan is one thing, seeing as China does not want to compete on the market for superconductors, 

but the Chinese are sitting on a mountain of both internal and foreign debts, which they have been trying to stall for time on, by debt trapping other nations and taking out more of their own debts, while frantically trying to improve their industrial sectors, while handling a rapidly aging population and an artificially stagnated birthrate, that could see their population fall by over 400 million by the end of the century.

the Chinese economy is massively debt heavy, and is going to pop at any minute, in my opinion, and will make Russia's recent financial woes look like a storm in a teacup.

.
.
.

If you are in the Chinese government, do you see your state miss its growth targets amongst rocketing Debt-GDP, and gamble on a Russian ""win"" using your hardware and manpower, that drags Russia into your orbit at the cost of pissing off the United States and costing you money in the short term,

or do you take the longer path, of having Russia fight on their own, get the crap beaten out of them, and then you come in to pay for Russia's reconstruction by Chinese investment firms?

Can your debt problem be kicked far enough down the road, that you don't go bust while waiting for Russia to fall into your clutches, or do you ""help"" them militarily  at the cost of Chinese blood and gold, in order to buy them out faster?

One option is a ticking clock, the other is an expensive gamble, both lead to China either going bust or getting the Siberian oil fields and the Russian banks.

Same philosophy still applies today. And I believe it also applies to front lines, but I'm not a general so who knows :/

Where they faired about as well as Russia is now, I might remind you. The parallels are remarkable. They got pissed off at Vietnam, invaded largely ineffectually across a mountain range and nearly impenetrable forest, redeclared their objectives so they could declare victory and withdrew. Vietnam remained in Cambodia for another decade, so no, it didn't work. 

They used an untested army to attack a country that had been in a state of near-continuous war since WWII. Granted, Ukraine has only been getting ready since 2014 but still the untested army part is quite similar, as is the highly motivated defenders. 

They tried again several years later with even worse results, getting their ass handed to them. 

China, in those affairs, was upset that Vietnam had gone in and overthrew Pol Pot, and it need to be noted was not the modern China we see today. It was not suffering a manufacturing setback, but was directly competing with Russia for the communist sphere of influence. And they themselves were much closer to the Cultural Revolution that they were trying to effect in Cambodia, and had just been thwarted at. I would say the motivations were political, not a ruse to placate the populace, and I would say their track record is not particularly good. Yes they were successful in Tibet, but Taiwan is quite different. 

They need the semiconductor fabs as much as we do, and all that microcode is encrypted hard, and the codes aren't even in Taiwan. This is a very complicated dimension to their Taiwan problem that has no parallel. Invading Taiwan would be very similar to mutually assured destruction.

They didn't cut off Germany completely. They reduced the flow so that they can't build up a storage for the winter so Russia can then turn it off when they need it the most to create a lot of harm. If they didn't care about the money they would've cut the gas since the early days of the war.

To me this just isn't a new escalation. I can understand things like being careful about sending ATACMS that can strike the Kremlin to Ukraine but also I think a big worry that led to not sending more heavy gear early was also that most western analysts expected Ukraine to be defeated fast and most of the fighting would be in the form of an insurgency.

Will it take some time? Absolutely. Will it take a decade or multiple decades?

Not really at this point. Mobilisation would mean they'd have to deploy from Moscow since that's where the rail network meets up. That's how the Tzars got murdered.

Are you joking? US pushed oil over $100 a barrel because they invaded Iraq, continued on in Iraq and Afghanistan even during the great recession, and doing the same with Russia with no US troops on the line isn't even a question. Anyone who thinks otherwise has no understanding of things.",False,1655927567.0,t3_vhvzki,t1_idcd1dv,,6,5,0,5,0,0,

A war for which they had months to prepare.

Obviously not, not even Russia thinks that. They might have tried it with the Baltics, but obviously they don't have the resouces at the moment. But part of their military doctrine is 'escalate to de-escalate'. So they could close the Suwalki gap. NATO will have to intervene. All our attention will be focused there instead of on Ukraine. Russia can try to make a breakthrough in Ukraine. Again, this is not my opinion, but the concern of actual experts.",False,1655920677.0,t3_vhvzki,t1_idbejvq,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia knows this too, last year they did military exercises practicing this exact scenario. This was all spelled out in the articles that I linked and you clearly didn't bother to read. 

Again, it is not me saying this, but the general agreement of military experts and NATO officials.
