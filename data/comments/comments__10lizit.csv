> The heaviest fights are taking place around Vuhledar and Bakhmut. Today the Russians started storming Vuhledar itself, and in the first half of the day, the Russians maintained the initiative. However, the Ukrainians made a smart decision, and instead of fighting them from the city, the Ukrainians pulled their tanks from behind the hills and entered the countryside that the Russians were leveraging. This forced the Russians to stop attacking Vuhledar immediately and devote all their resources to resolving the problems at hand.

> The Ukrainians regrouped and started counterattacking the Russians already yesterday. And today, the intensity of Ukrainian counterattacks has only increased. In order to undermine Russian defenses and push them away from the edges of the northern countryside, the Ukrainians advanced on tanks from behind the hills, moved halfway along the tree belts, and fired at Russian-occupied fortifications. Under cover of heavy fire, a mobile Ukrainian attack group rapidly crossed the field and established their positions near the first blocks. From here, they managed to expand their control over the area, and now the control over the settlement is split 50/50. This is very bad news for the Russians because they can no longer continue pushing along their main axis of advance.

Offers specialist training in Norway for Ukrainian soldiers

News | Date: 26.01.2023 | Ministry of Defence

- Norway will train Ukrainian specialists in sanitation, sharpshooting and team leader training, says Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram (Sp)

Norway is already contributing to the training of Ukrainian soldiers through Operation Interflex in Great Britain. This effort will continue in 2023, and the number of instructors will increase. Norway also contributes financial support and instructors to the EU's training mission, and Norway will help train Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal officers.

The training of Ukrainian specialists will be carried out in Norway. According to the plan, it will start this spring and be carried out in several rounds through 2023.

- The training will complement the other training initiatives. Our contribution will strengthen the overall training effort and will be welcomed by both Ukraine and our allies. We will help quickly increase the capabilities of Ukrainian soldiers and increase the total number of soldiers western countries can train, says Gram.

Ukraine will have a significant need for military support going forward and training an important part of this support.

- Ukraine needs more and better trained soldiers to fight the Russian invasion forces. In addition, they need to increase their competence in several professional fields. It is important that Norway takes its share of this and contributes where we can, says Gram.

The government will continue to support Ukraine as long as necessary.

- Work is ongoing with more donations and contributions, both directly from Norway and through collaboration with other countries. The government is planning a larger aid package for Ukraine that will last several years, says Gram.",False,1674733969.0,t3_10lizit,t3_10lizit,,0,85,0,85,0,0,

Russian Vuhledar offensive is in its third day. The front line has not moved but the gray area is littered with dead Russians and burning vehicles.

Vuhledar is a small Soledar-sized town. The main draw for Russia is PR. It's one of the best fortified Ukrainian strongholds and a gateway into the non-occupied parts of the Donetsk oblast that Putin's genius already declared Russian territory. 

This is Putin's Winter Offensive, take three. Take one was Bakhmut and it turned into a wet fart. Last week's Orikhiv offensive 100 km to the west cost the Russians a few thousand casualties but failed to make any progress. 

It's hard to imagine that Putin's braindead commanders could react to the failure at Orikhiv and pivot towards Vuhledar as quickly as they did. That suggests that Orikhiv was a feint to divert Ukrainian attention before the real attack at Vuhledar. Either way, Orikhiv failed either of the goals. Orikhiv stands and Vuhledar is ready. 

Mostly static front lines at Vuhledar disguise the amount of effort the Russians are putting into trying to move them. They've got a lot of troops there, the absolute best Gerasimov has. The spearhead is the freshly reconstituted 40th and 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigades, the sorry descendants of WWII badasses from Stalingrad. They were here before. Back in November the Black Berets took heavy casualties [standing around an open field near Pavlivka](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/zt144w/russian_soldiers_charge_across_open_field_with/) (the video uploader incorrectly captioned it as Bakhmut):

> By 9 November 2022, the 155th Guards Naval Infantry and 40th Naval Infantry Brigade participated in an attack on the Ukrainian military garrison in Pavlivka. Members of the unit claimed to have taken roughly 300 casualties, with many of these complaints shared with notable Russian media figures and the unit's garrison. The members went further stating the attacks took place due to their commander's desire to earn bonuses and distinction through awards.

Pavlivka was eventually taken by the Russians, and they are now mounting some of their attacks on Vuhledar from there. Helping the Black Berets this time around is the Dagestani 136th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade. One of the least terrible DPR militia units the 123rd Rifle Regiment is also there. In short: the best troops Gerasimov can muster are fighting here, today. 

Videos from the first day showed immense Russian biomass spread around open fields that was getting [pulverized by accurate UA artillery](https://twitter.com/GloOouD/status/1617960204318167040). Yesterday Russians brought out a TOS-1 and [nuked a civilian neighborhood](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/10kxbyz/reportedly_footage_of_ukrainian_town_vuhledar/) with the hospital at the center, which allowed them to advance by as much as 400 meters before being pushed back to the starting point later in the day. 

Today Ukraine is publishing more videos of bullseyeing Russian vehicles, including [those of the famed 155th](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1618685215425302528). Even Russian propagandists are not rushing to claim victory. The most optimistic Russian maps simply paint the [contested grey area](https://deepstatemap.live/#14/47.7684/37.2546) red. 

We can expect Russia to continue to burn through their best units, and for Ukraine to slowly pull back and utilize their superior recon and artillery to inflict outsized casualties on the attacker. By this time next week, regardless of whoever holds Vuhledar, indiscriminate Russian shelling will likely turn it into yet another hellish moonscape.",1674766994.0,1674766478.0,t3_10lizit,t3_10lizit,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

As a Wagner mercenary, he gets $5,000 plus allowances, which brings him up to $7,000.

>  
>\- **Germany aims to have the Leopard 2 tanks integrated on the battlefield by the end of March**, the Defense Ministry said, helping arm Ukraine for a potential spring offensive. That leaves a tight window for logistics and training, which will begin in Germany “basically immediately,” said ministry spokesperson, Arne Collatz.  
>  
>\- **The M1 Abrams tanks are unlikely to arrive by spring when both Russian and Ukrainian forces are set to begin new offensives**. They will be ordered from manufacturers rather than transferred from existing U.S. stocks, officials said.  
>  
>\- Russia condemned the moves to send tanks to Ukraine. “This extremely dangerous decision takes the conflict to a new level of confrontation,” said Russia’s ambassador to Germany, Sergey Nechayev. In Moscow, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision left little prospect for a “diplomatic way out” of the war.  
>  
>\- **With tanks on the way, top Ukrainian officials have their eyes on Western aircraft**. “We have new tasks ahead: Western-type fighter jets, sanctions, Peace Formula implementation,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday. The need for newer weapons was also raised by Zelensky after he said he spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “We have to unlock the supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine; it is important for us to expand our cooperation in artillery. We have to achieve the supply of aircraft to Ukraine,” Zelensky said during his Wednesday night address.  
>  
>*Battleground updates*  
>  
>\- **A senior French official expressed concern Wednesday that Germany’s Leopard 2 tanks may not be operable in Ukraine in time for increased fighting in the spring**. France announced earlier this month that it would send its light AMX 10-RCs combat tanks to Ukraine. “Training for tanks takes a long time,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters. “Even if the Ukrainians have shown great agility and a very uncanny ability to absorb new equipment, it will necessarily take time.” Poland, which plans to send 14 tanks, aims to have its delivery on the ground in Ukraine by the end of March, a Polish security official confirmed to The Post.  
>  
>\- **Zelensky said the number of tanks and how long it will take to deliver them to Ukraine is “critical.”** In an excerpt of an interview with Sky News, slated to air in full Thursday, he thanked Germany, Britain and the United States. “But speaking frankly, the number of tanks and the delivery time to Ukraine is critical,” he said.  
>  
>\- **Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern city of Soledar**, military spokesman Sergiy Cherevaty told The Post on Wednesday. Ukrainian forces “withdrew in an organized manner and nothing chaotic. They withdrew and took up defense,” he said, adding that they had inflicted “colossal losses on the enemy.” The Post could not independently verify his claims. Cherevaty declined to say when the withdrawal took place.  
>  
>\- **In the Donetsk region, Ukrainian troops face “dozens of enemy attacks every day**,” Zelensky said Wednesday. “This is where Russia is constantly trying to break our defense.” One of Russia’s objectives is to capture the entirety of the Donetsk region, territory claimed by one of its proxies in Donbas, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank.

>Vladimir Osechkin, an influential human rights activist and journalist, has long been a thorn in the side of many powerful Russians. After founding Gulagu.net in 2011 – a collaborative human rights organization targeting corruption and torture in Russia – he has overseen a string of high-profile investigations accusing Russian institutions and ministries of crimes. One alleged the systematic rape of male prisoners in Russian prisons.  
>  
>But it was Gulagu.net’s work since Russian tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border in February that gave the organization newfound international relevance.  
>  
>The prison investigation inspired one group of officers from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) – the successor to the Soviet Union’s KGB – to turn whistleblower, driven by what the officers said was their “disgusted surprise” at Gulagu.net’s findings, Osechkin said. This led to #windofchange, a series of letters purportedly from FSB personnel shared with Osechkin’s organization. Published online by Osechkin’s team, they detailed their dissent with Russia’s direction and war in Ukraine.  
>  
>Putin’s so-called “special military operation” wasn’t the only movement of Russians after February 24. It also sparked “a big wave” of Russian officials leaving their homeland, Osechkin said, dwarfed only by the flood of men fleeing the Kremlin’s “partial mobilization” order in September. Now, he told CNN, “It’s every day some people … ask \[for\] our help.”  
>  
>Many are low-level soldiers, but among them are far bigger prizes: Osechkin says their number include an ex-government minister and a former three-star Russian general – CNN has confirmed the identities of an ex-FSB officer and Wagner mercenaries.

Wappie has been an insult in Dutch (so Netherlands and Flemish) similar to idiot/dumb. But pretty weak and not used much.

Now when covid came along and you got those antivaxers and the likes, we started to call them wappies. The weakness of the insult actually plays through. Antivaxers makes things edgier. A wappie? Oh you ignore and don’t pay attention to.

I believe myself many of the narratives from wappies have been pushed or at least helped by russian disinfo influence. Not limited to antivax and covid conspiracies, but it is the core of people who we as Dutch call wappies.

According to analyst Alexander Gabuev, Putin is becoming increasingly emotional and reckless, and this is reflected in Russia's policies, Sky News reports.  
Gabuev refers to recent statements by Putin in a few tweets. In an interview on Russian television, he stated that Ukraine has set up special battalions full of nationalists to shoot 'retreating deserters'. Remarkable, because the Soviet Union did have these types of battalions during the Second World War.  
This statement, according to Gabuev, shows that Putin has worked himself into a so-called fact trap and may only receive edited messages about developments in Ukraine.  
He says this is worrying because a lack of complete information may influence the decisions the Kremlin makes.  
Gabuev therefore wonders whether Putin believes in his own lies and to what extent the West takes this into account. He calls Putin an ""emotional and reckless,"" president who makes decisions based on emotion rather than facts.

We saw Wagner basically charge Soledar and possibly burn themselves out of the fight in doing so. And lately Russia is sending lots of recon squads all along the front lines, probing for weak spots. Trying to flank here and there. And then as soon as they sniff a chance, they put their troops in a grey zone and push. Very aggressive activity. Apparently huge losses for Russians. I've heard over 3k dead just yesterday. So it's tough on Ukraine, too. The lines are reportedly holding though. And all across the line, attackers will pay a heavy price right now. Like guys just charging across a river and uphill. That video of unsupported infantry just walking basically naked across an open field. It sounds crazy. And I don't think Russia has the stuff to do massive pushes, so they are just trying to see if there's anything anywhere they can exploit right now to get momentum. I think the conjecture is Ukraine would rather not launch an offense right now and risk weakening their lines somewhere else, so they are content to sit and hold for a bit until conditions change / get new equipment / etc.

If these reports are true though, those losses aren't sustainable. The Russian military might be burning itself out like Wagner did in Soledar. But they might start doing that en masse. They could wait for more equipment, but at this point, the Western equipment might arrive about the same time or sooner So they might be doing one last crazy series of pushes, aggressively trying to make something happen. I wouldn't be surprised if we see Ukraine have to step back here and there, like they did in Soledar. They can play to their long-term advantage. The clock is ticking for Russia, they know it, and the generals are making all kinds of political considerations on top of that.

Think of Russia as a village where on 3 out of 20 people are able bodied.

Losing 1 of those 3 able bodied people is a disaster.

If Russia loses 1.8 million of its 18 million people able-bodied people the whole 140 million person country breaks down.

There is a rule that if a country suddenly loses 10% of its workforce, the whole economy breaks down. Virtually every production line in the economy will experience a critical failure. A good example was Ireland in the potato famine.

Due to it being largely poor and highly patriarchal, Russia’s society and economy relies almost entirely on its 18 million able-bodied men.

Losing 1.8million is disaster. Between people leaving, casualties and mobilisation, Russia has already lost 1 million from its economy.

To be conservative I say another 900k will lead to societal collapse.

It may be even less than that for 2 reasons. Firstly, I’m assuming Russia is suffering only 1.5 WIA for every 1 KIA. Secondly it assumes mobilisation and loss of able-bodied people is uniform across the country.

It’s actually possible that right now Russia is only another 500k casualties away from societal collapse.

First of all, about power: he is not an OG oligarch, nor is he a member of the silovik club. He is a ""new"" oligarch whose wealth and status was given to him by Putin because he served Putin in useful ways, and still does. But he does not have much political power at all. He is an outsider to the FSB, which is the faction in Russia that has the most real tangible power (they have all the dirt on everyone, they are the ones who make people fall out of windows, they watch and keep tabs on anyone who is remotely important or potentially dangerous). The FSB will not want Prigozhin in power, because Prigozhin would not want former Putin loyalists in such a powerful organization if he became president - in fact that would be incredibly dangerous for him. As what happens in any dictatorship, the new leader's first task is to purge anyone who might start to ""miss the old days"". So the FSB will do everything they can to prevent Prigozhin getting the seat. They will only back one of their own, or if it is an outsider, it will be some technocrat who puts a harmless face on the country but ultimately answers to the FSB. 

I mean, Patrushev and Bortnikov are fuckloads more powerful than Prigozhin. 

As for military force, Wagner has about 10k actual military contractors. The rest of the 50k are convicts according to the US intelligence report and anyway they've already lost some 20-30k of that force trying to rake Soledar. They complain about being poorly equipped and not getting the equipment they need. So what help is a few tens of thousands of poorly equipped gopniks going to be? Absolutely none. 

The Kremkin has got 3-400,000 Rosgvardiya and OMON national guard, and on top of that there are some 1.2 million policemen. That's not even including the military which is still inside Russia - obviously not at full strength, but it still exists. Prigozhin would need to get at least two out of those three groups on his side, and there's just no way. The siloviki have no reason to support him, and plenty of reasons to be strongly against him. 

If Putin dies before Patrushev, Patrushev will most Kiely be the kingmaker. Of course there may be in fighting, but if Patrushev (security council chief, former FSB director, and close personal friend of Putin) has the support of Bortnikov (current FSB director), I'm quite sure it wouldn't be long before they ""persuaded"" Zolotov (current National Guard chief) to get on board, Shoigu will easily fall in line, and at that point there really aren't many forces who could go against him. Bortnikov might be a candidate, but it's also quite possible they decide to put a harmless and controllable technocrat like Mishustin or Nabiullina in charge, especially if their aim is to try and blame all this war on Putin and do a U-turn on Ukraine. 

In any case, Prigozhin is almost a nobody. He's never becoming president of Russia.",False,1674773093.0,t3_10lizit,t1_j60e177,,5,0,0,0,0,0,

The fact that they're *still* fighting to control Ukraine after nearly a year is a sign of weakness not strength.

No, that's what you *thought* the point was.

>I have explained why I believe the claim that Catalonia's independence movement was instigated by Russia is highly dubious and therefore requires evidence.

This is what you should have said *at the start*.  This is what we meant by bolstering your argument with evidence.  You cannot prove a negative, but you can explain *why you believe what you believe*.  When you decline to do that, why would anyone believe you over the person who also stated their unsubstantiated belief?

*THAT* was the ""whole point"".  But you completely missed it, until you were *this deep in the comment chain*.

Stating this *at the start* would have avoided the whole comment chain, but you decided you're *so smart and we're so dumb* that we clearly missed something and you needed to educate us.
