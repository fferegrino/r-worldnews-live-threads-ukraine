Lyubov, 57, whose last name was withheld and face was not shown, worked as an accountant and lived under Russian occupation for more than a year. 

“In January of this year, they came for me,” she told the House Foreign Affairs Committee via a translator. Lyubov said that Russian soldiers forced their way into her house, claiming they were looking for weapons, and confiscated ""a map of Ukraine, the flag of Ukraine, souvenir magnets with Ukraine images, and a token with blue and yellow ribbon symbolizing victims of World War II.""

“Those were their evidence against me,” she said.

She was taken to what she called a ""torture chamber"" and held for five days, where she was beaten, forced to undress, cut with a knife, and threatened with rape and murder.

""I also was taken out into the field and they beat me again and they were putting a handgun next to my head and shooting as if, as if executing me,"" she recounted. ""Also forced me to dig my own grave.""

She said she saw other people being tortured, ""taken out with black plastic bags on their heads.""

""I worry so much for them. I would love to find them one day but I am not sure if they’re still alive,"" she said.

Lyubov said the soldiers let her go, “but they said they will come back.”

When she returned to her house, it had been looted, and they had taken away medals that belonged to her father.

She was able to flee Kherson and made her way to the United States to be with her daughter, but she hopes be able to return to Ukraine.

""I'm telling you my story, and there are other people who are getting robbed and raped and beaten in those territories now,"" she said. ""These terrible crimes need to be stopped.""

Sweden's foreign minister Tobias Billstrom says there are hopes that his country can join NATO by the time of a summit of the alliance in July.

Speaking during a meeting with his Serbian counterpart Ivica Dacic in Belgrade, Mr Billstrom said Sweden ""will be a security provider for the organisation and it is clear that we are welcome"".

""We are very, very hopeful for the inclusion of Sweden into NATO at the Vilnius summit.""

Sweden and its neighbour Finland both applied to join NATO in May 2022, setting aside years of military nonalignment to seek protection under the organisation's security umbrella.

Finland officially became a member earlier this month after its application was processed in record time.

But Sweden's bid is still on hold due to opposition from Turkey and Hungary.

The two countries will be encouraged by the US to ratify Sweden's accession, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said during a visit to Sweden today.

He said the US looks forward to welcoming Sweden as a NATO member before the July summit.

They provide multiple articles that the Russians published at the time, saying similar things.  Then reviewed their own sources in Ukrainian military.

Here’s a portion of what they write:

> Back then, we didn’t have any information about such a large-scale operation by Ukrainian forces. Further, the Ukrainian and Russian military denied that such a landing or battle took place. After the publication of *The Times* piece, we spoke with the same sources again that we had contacted in October 2022. Both the Russians and Ukrainians once again confirmed that there was no three-hour battle or a landing the size of a reinforced battalion in October. 

> *“That would be a major operation, and I would have known about it. That was not prepared or carried out. During the September thru November period, the Special Forces were regularly around there, but in small groups—going near ZNPP and around Energodar, landing there at night in small groups, tracking the movements of Russian troops, monitoring the nuclear station, and working on communications behind Russian lines,”* says the Ukrainian officer. 

> *“I was in Energodar myself back on October 21; no one said anything about an attempt to land bad storm then. Yes, there were skirmishes with the Ukrainian Special Forces coming up on our shore, but no, nothing like with such force.  There was a danger every day, because Ukrainian forces constantly trickled onto our shore,”* says a Russian officer.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,12rg3v5,jgydr3c,"Yesterday, one of the pro-Ukraine Donbass sources, who has maintained excellent sources with locals in occupied areas, 
posted this on **Avdiivka, the line of contact, and Russian readiness**:

> The current situation regarding the Line of Contact:

> About two weeks ago, Russian troops launched assault operations from Opytny towards Avdiivka. As a result, a salient has formed that worries our troops: because of this, the front line has been stretched out, and threats are created for the operational encirclement of *individual* sectors. Logic dictates that such a salient must be quickly eliminated, since reinforcements and equipment are thrown there by the Russians. And there are a lot of such speeches at the Line of Contact. 

> With sufficient replenishment, the Russians can launch a new offensive using assault units, which are now actively being formed in the Russian army (we will talk about this later). But perhaps the Armed Forces of Ukraine are waiting for a sufficiently large number of them to gather there? Why transfer ammunition in vain! 

> A second dangerous salient, which continues to grow in that area, was formed as a result of the offensive of the Russians from the *village* of Krasnogorovka (not to be confused with the *city* of Krasnogorovka, west of Donetsk) towards the village of Stepnoe. The Russians want to seize the road and the railway track leading to the settlement. Ocheretino. At present, the Russians are not moving forward, but are trying to expand their flanks, as they understand that the narrow salient of the UAF can be easily cut. 

> In that sector, in addition to artillery, the enemy is actively using aviation, which causes many problems for our troops in all sectors. I think it is understandable why our command is talking about the need to receive aircraft from partners, preferably F-16, so that the enemy does not have an advantage in the sky. 

> According to information from open sources—which is generally confirmed by the data of the population of the occupied regions [to our channel]—despite attempts to attack, the Russians have already created a deep defense line along the entire front line. For example, from the Kherson region to Mariupol, behind the line of Contact, the Russians have equipped three lines of defense, not even counting anti-tank ditches and concrete barriers. 

> And one of the most powerful fortified areas has been created near Ugledar [Vuhledar]—Dokuchaevsk, Novotroitskoye, Olginka, Volnovakha, Vladimirovka, Nikolskoye, Velikoanadolsky forest and the villages adjacent to it—crammed with Russian military equipment, personnel, ammunition warehouses, and fuel and lubricants. The same is represented by the sections of Svatovo-Kremennaya, Rubizhnoye-Severodonetsk-Lysichansk, Gorlovka-Yenakiyevo-Uglegorsk [Vuhlehirsk], and Donetsk itself with Makeevka—where, moreover, the entire leadership of the occupying forces is concentrated. 

> The above can be regarded as the preparation of the Russians to repel the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is being talked about literally all the time. But such a concentration of already-accumulated troops during the day can easily go from defensive to offensive operations throughout the line of Contact. Considering that the Russians are planning [they say] to launch their offensive one day or hours before the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (how will they know this?), in order to disorganize the Ukrainian defense and break plans, we need to keep our units at a high degree of readiness. However, as always during the war!

2. If peace talks are proposed, still attend to “get caught trying.” They’ll inevitably fall through, but it’ll buy enough time for…
3. Training and equipping Ukrainian pilots and ground crews for NATO fighter planes. 
4. Once peace talks end and the fighting picks up again, launch a proper NATO combined arms offensive to retake everything. 

Even if the counteroffensive succeeds and Ukraine retakes the south, this is still a likely sequence of events, as assuming the Russians don’t completely collapse, an assault on Crimea will be difficult. Personally I don’t see Crimea, or even the Donbas being 100% guaranteed to be recaptured without western fighter jets. Hence the opportunity to build up that capability while fruitless peace talks continue on. This is why the war won’t end until 2024, because it’ll take time to get western air power into the hands of the Ukrainians.

In other words, the counteroffensive’s success will contribute, but not be critical to Ukraine’s victory. NATO fighter jets will, and regardless of how the counteroffensive plays out it’ll take time to fully equip the Ukrainians for victory.",False,1681933313.0,t3_12rg3v5,t3_12rg3v5,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

It’s becomes clear that Russia can’t conquer Ukraine, but Ukrainians can’t fully push them out either.

US and West pressure Ukraine to a peace deal, while China and India pressure Russia to a peace deal. The borders end being where the Ukraine offensive ends, more or less. Some type of agreement is made by early 2024-mid 2024. Focus shifts completely to Taiwan/China.

I mostly agree with your forecast except that I think the countries in question are more reserved in pushing the peace agenda. They also have skin in the game. 

Long story short, Ukraine keeps all of Ukraine and perhaps they settle on Crimea.  My view is that, the amount of bodies the russians are throwing into the meat grinder is alarming. Sure, they control the narrative through their media but its only a matter of time before women roam the streets in higher numbers, talk to one another and the conversation starts as follows ""youre a widow? Oh im a widow too! My sister just lost her husband last week."" 

Perception management is vital to Putin. He cant brag of a macho country, if hes killed all the machos. There is just no good ending for Putin. I can see russia sending another wave of untrained/underprepared soldiers and make gains, only for them to lose ground again because of a lack of military resources (like food).

The entire video is about small attacks in the Zaporizhzhia direction, which is not ""ALL OVER THE FRONT LINE"". Also, no one is going to look back on those specific attacks as ""the beginning of the counter offensive."" 

20 Feb - Russians OPERATION IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE

Certainly there were some attack vectors that made no ground in Kharkiv.

There has not been a single day of this entire war in which Russia has air superiority. Air superiority means you can effectively control the skies to the point that you can launch airstrikes anywhere without getting shot down. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has air superiority and both sides are at extreme danger of being shot down. 

Even without air superiority fighters are still very useful. Many of the missile attacks Russia has launched have been from fighters which are operating within Russia. Fighters serve as another vehicle to launch missiles and currently Ukraine has very few options to strike beyond 100ish kilometers. This means Russia can safely keep their headquarters and supply depots out of Ukrainian range.

The idea that russia will be able to successfully defend a large front against a concentrated counteroffensive (which will involve concentrated artillery and launch of linear mine clearing charges, followed immediately by a tank assault and armored bulldozers to create a path through any physical tank defenses, supported by drones and possibly attack helicopters) is reliant on the idea that the russians have significant un-committed rear forces in reserve that can respond to it, and haven't just been progressively meat grinding their troops and resources in Bakhmut.

IMO a counteroffensive is also pretty unlikely to result in a limited gains scenario - it will either end in no gains following a successful defense of the russian line (unlikely), or it will result in a point breakthrough by Ukrainian tanks and IFVs followed by the rapid flanking and collapse of a large section of the russian line with significant reclamation of territory and disruption of russian rear logistics - as happened previously.

The danger of this narrative is that many within positions of power, likely including good ole Vladimir Vladimirivitch himself, believe it. Because they have this notion that Russians can withstand any suffering meanwhile the west is decadent it created the illusion that if push comes to shove western countries will cave in to Russian demands. This then makes the Kremlin more hostile and confrontational because they fundamentally don’t understand the west and they believe their own lies.
