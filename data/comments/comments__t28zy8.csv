Speaking after western allies announced new financial measures against Russia, including the removal of some Russian banks from the Swift global payments network, the official said the measures were designed to target the Kremlin and individuals tied to the Russian government.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west. We will also engage other governments, so as to detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and deny these individuals their ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world,‚Äù the official said.

They said that all 10 of Russia‚Äôs largest financial institutions had now been subjected to sanctions ‚Äì ‚Äúholding nearly 80% of the Russian banking sector‚Äôs total assets‚Äù.

As a result, the official said: ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs government borrowing costs have more than doubled to almost 17%. The S&P credit rating agency has downgraded Russia to junk status. Within 24 hours of our actions the demand for cash in Russia spiked 58 fold, according to reports, and the Russian government scrambled to deplete its own resources to try and shore up its banks and its currency. In short, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.‚Äù

Russia has been reported to have $630bn in financial reserves stored abroad, in gold and cash, but the new sanctions would render that fund useless, the official said.

‚ÄúYou heard about fortress Russia, the war chest of $630bn of foreign reserves,‚Äù they said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impressive, but it‚Äôs only impressive if Russia can use those reserves. And that means Russia has to be able to sell those reserves and buy rubles to support its currency. And so what we‚Äôre committing to do here is to disarm the central bank. And the way we can do that, for example, is by banning US, EU UK, persons from selling rubles to the Central Bank of Russia. That means very simply, the Russian Central Bank can‚Äôt support the ruble, full stop, and that means our sanctions will have much greater force.‚Äù

It is only some banks because some might either be too small and insignificant or simply too big to fail for western markets. Also leaves room to still add additional banks to the list and apply even more pressure

But you have to understand, disconnecting one major bank from swift is a very major sanction, disconnecting multiple is crippling and to freeze the assets of the central bank is absolutely brutal for an economy that was already struggling. Especially with the sanctions that were already in place/been announced.

In other words: Russia cant import key materials for their most important sectors, many banks have been disconnected from the global finance market and their central bank cant even try to stimulate the economy because its assets have been frozen. 

So if your bank is not able to conduct financial transactions and your central bank cant counteract, panic and run on banks will follow. In a post covid world economy that was already facing inflation as it is, this is absolutely lethal for the russian economy. These are the best options, that wont drag us down the drain with Putin

> As it became known to OBOZREVATEL , in the Bilgorod region, which borders on the Kharkiv, Luhansk, Sumy regions, there was a real riot among the Russian military. About 5,000 contract soldiers, who were hastily collected to be sent to Ukraine, refused to go to fight for Putin.

> Formally, the rebellious contractors argue their refusal to participate in hostilities in Ukraine by the fact that this is not provided for in their contracts.

> However, according to our sources, the real reason that forces the Russian military to risk being subjected to criminal prosecution by the authorities is fear. The employees of the occupying army are really shocked by the professionalism of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the huge damage in equipment and manpower that the Ukrainian soldiers have already inflicted on the RF Armed Forces and other power units that Russia sent to Ukraine.

Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted Saturday that Kyiv was ‚Äúcreating an IT army‚Äù to ‚Äúcontinue to fight on the cyber front‚Äù as Russian forces continue their assault on Ukraine.


Fedorov tweeted a link to a channel on the messaging app Telegram that encouraged hackers to conduct cyberattacks on key Russian energy firms and financial firms. The proposed target list includes natural gas giant Gazprom and big Russian banks Sberbank and VTB. The Biden administration sanctioned the two banks on Thursday over Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

The Telegram channel promoted by Fedorov was translated into English to appeal to ‚Äúall IT specialists from other countries,‚Äù the English version said.

Cyberattacks have had a supporting role in the Russia-Ukraine war. A series of so-called distributed denial of service attacks flooded Ukrainian government websites with phony traffic prior to Russia‚Äôs invasion. The White House blamed one of those rounds of hacks on Russia‚Äôs GRU military agency (Moscow denied the allegation.).

On Friday, Ukrainian officials accused the Belarusian Ministry of Defense of trying to hack the private email accounts of Ukrainian military personnel. The ministry did not return CNN‚Äôs request for comment.

‚Ä¢Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities were being subjected to further attacks overnight, as the Russian assault continued. In Kyiv numerous journalists reported two large explosions, while unconfirmed reports said an airbase south-west of the city may have been targeted.

‚Ä¢The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, agreed to remove ‚Äúselected Russian banks‚Äù from the Swift payment system. A senior US administration official told the Guardian that Russia has become a ‚Äúglobal economic and financial pariah‚Äù.

‚Ä¢Germany said it would send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, in a departure from previous policy. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said the Russian invasion marked a ‚Äúturning point‚Äù. Germany also permitted the Netherlands to send 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine.

1. Russia didn't plan for a real war and didn't expect resistance.
2. Putin doesn't care about sanctions.
3. Russia does not have the $$ set aside to fight for more than a few days. It's costing them several billions a day. Hence why they didn't deploy the remaining 2/3 of the army, they can't afford the fuel or ammo.
4. Russian army is kinda boned, they didn't expect full scale war and didn't stock up on enough missiles and rockets. They have expended a significant number of them and are rationing them (probably Iskander and Kaliber).
5. Russian factories can't replenish their stocks of advanced munitions for several more months as raw materials needed come from Europe and their now cut off.
6. Russian military industrial complex has plenty of small arms and conventional munitions.
7. Alpha Group and other special forces infiltrated into area near Kyiv a week before the fighting started, but their few in number so their plan is to sow panic with infiltration and essentially terrorist attacks to hope the Zelensky government will panic or resistance will crumble.
8. My Take: Ukrainians have recovered info from captured Russians that infiltrated or attempted to YOLO in Kyiv and it's a mix of elite special forces and paramilitary OMON units. Russians are failing to provided good armored support and enough manpower for special forces to assist in the capture of Kyiv. Their literally sending in paramilitaries with tanks and IFVs but OMON don't exactly know how to support tanks in retaking a city. They train to fight insurgents in the Caucasus. Jihadi's don't exactly have hunter killer teams with Javelin and NLAW stalking your armor.

However, Crimea is winning in the South and even if Ukraine won back Mariupol, they're in trouble in the South with invasion forces winning critical cities there.

Ukraine is now categorically showing that they are a quality army, holding off what should be a vastly superior invasion force in numbers and in technology. This cannot be understated - Western efforts to level the playing field technology-wise and give the Ukrainian defenders intel that have offered the edge in terms of preparedness.

Putin is furious and Ukraine has a fighting chance, here‚Äôs why

From @RihoTerras (member of the European Parliament) from twitter:
‚ÄúIntel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin‚Äôs lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.

Russians didn‚Äôt have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can‚Äôt physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months ‚Äì if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.

Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians ‚Äì women and children ‚Äì to sow panic. This is their trump card.

Russia‚Äôs whole plan relies on panic ‚Äì that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.

The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is.

The UK and Spain were early supporters of the move to lock Russia out of Swift, the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, but Germany was a key holdout.

On Saturday, however, Annalena Baerbock, Germany‚Äôs foreign minister, said the country was working on a ‚Äútargeted and functional restriction‚Äù on Swift. Hours later, the joint statement by western allies, including Germany, was released.

It is a victory for Ukraine, which had pleaded since Thursday for countries to ban Russia ‚Äì foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba going so far as to say that European and US politicians would have ‚Äúblood on their hands‚Äù if they did not.

But it remains unclear how widespread the ban will be. The statement from the west referred to removing ‚Äúselected Russian banks‚Äù from Swift, but gave no specifics.

The US, like Germany, had initially been sceptical about the Swift ban. The Observer‚Äôs economics editor, Phillip Inman, wrote that ‚Äúone reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious‚Äù:

The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email.

4. UA uses ""terrorist tactics"" by placing heavy armaments in residential areas.

Now I'm so used to many ways of life here and things feel ""normal"" like it's a second home, but distinct and separated from things from my ""old home"". 

Most people in Thailand seem like they wouldn't be concerned for anything happening outside of Asia since the culture is so different and they rarely participate in wars anyway, but my belief has be proved wrong time and time again.

Now, with the war that recently broke out, I'm surprised to hear many Thai people discuss the war happening in a place they have never really cared about. But they care now because it's such a tragedy and I appreciate that.

I'm a teacher and even my 6 year old students in one of my classes were talking about Ukraine vs Russia. I didn't expect them to care. I don't think it's just memes, I think there is a genuine concern for what's happening around the world.

It blows my mind to think that there are about 200 countries on this planet and they are all full of people discussing current events in their own languages and comparing events to their own past experiences. 

There are 8 billion unique people in the world. There have never been so many people alive at one time and we've never had social media connecting us like this, letting us basically livestream a war.

1. NATO/Generational/Political division comments  
2. ""Wont someone think of the poor Russian soldier?""  
3. ""Nukes! Are we going to die from nukes now? I'm so afraid""  
4. The Ghost of Kiev (also now Snake Island) is fake (disproven https://twitter.com/poroshenko/status/1497293195763408905) 
5. Posting propaganda or bad takes as a question or as though you were arguing against them (e.g. My dad thinks Ukraine...)  
6. ""Russias best forces are in reserve""  
7. ""OMG *thermobaric weapons* are going to be used if we don't give in to Putin""
8. ""tHe cHeChEns aRe CoMiNg!1""
9. ""If NATO and Russian forces touch/shootdown a plane/see each other, WW3 begins"" (counterexample https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-air_combat_losses_between_the_Soviet_Union_and_the_United_States)

what are we waiting for to intervene? Tanks shooting at apartment buildings full of people? rounding up civiliians in subways and gassing them? If NATO cannot stop this from happening, NATO has failed and Putin is right about everything. Let's obliterate Putin in a massive overwhelming attack while they are focused on Ukraine. take out the ICBMs immediately, then all the mines, all the gas pipelines, refineries, oligarchs lairs, etc.

all of eastern europe, and the EU eventually, will see consequences from this inaction. this will NEVER end until the deed is done. And the EU is too tied up with them geopolitically.

Yes, they could because as somebody stated above, you send in a lot of your ""older"" equipment first to get your enemy to show his hand and then you send in your more complex and advance military equipment in to really give it hell.

The No is its killing (if true) thousands of military personal, it's adding a lot of strain on the Russian Oligarchs to put a seize to Putins intentions because of their currency is literally going to be lesser value than an American penny (just a scale I used), and it shows to the world they are realy just that incompetent. 

Looking at a historical side behind this, look at how draconian wars of the past was fought. You send in the slaves or prisoners, the poor, the poorly trained and majorly inadequate forces to try your best to force the opportunity hands, but then you keep following it up with arrow volleys and heavy horsemen and do your best to make them run and surrender.

I also love how all these places in Ukraine are getting bombed yet they offer no coherent explanation as to who is doing it.

Edit 3: Windows were shattered in Donetsk 4 days ago we cannot possibly talk about anything else.

At this point, it was expectd that the Ukrainian government would be captured at the capital, or would flee to Poland, allowing Putin to install a new ""interim government"" under his control over a demoralised Ukraine.

Unfortunately for him, he *completely underestimated* the resolve of Ukraine to resist, and his troops failed to achieve their objectives and suffered higher than expected losses.

It also would have reduced the sheer amount of land that the Ukrainian's are stretched out to defend, making encircling Kiev harder.

OT: Had GAD for a decade as well after a burn-out and I know that it absolutely sucks. So hopefully this bit of info can provide you with some relief:
   
Found out that it was caused by my breathing patterns that had shifted to basically chronic hyperventilation. Retrained my breathing patterns using the Buteyko method and nowadays I no longer have GAD.
  
If you feel anxious: keep breathing though your nose. It's the natural ""rate limiter"" and safety net for your anxiety.

Ukraine isn't anywhere close to winning this war. They are doing very good job at stalling it for now but Russia still holds an overwhelming advantage.

Now however - it IS true that in case Russia really gave up and some major changes followed (say, new government) then sanctions could be lifted. But that's happening not anytime soon either. They shouldn't be lifted unless serious changes have occured and probably EVEN in that case a big portion of them should remain in effect for years (eg. SWIFT ban effectively cuts off Russia from the market altogether forcing EU member states to find alternative energy providers).

6544713a6ad546605e1e91ba09db3198,t28zy8,hykyjcu,"Hello, master of environmental science candidate here:

The fumes are going to be full of PAHs (poly aromatic hydrocarbons) which are carcinogenic. PAHs will deposit on the surrounding area contaminating both topsoil and vegetation. Possible routes of exposure to Ukrainians in the area include inhalation of those fumes (though that‚Äôs more short term) and incidental ingestion of contaminated soil. The ingestion of soil particles of particular concern because of the movement of heavy military vehicles and explosions which will kick up soil into the air where it be more readily ingested. 

Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs aka the oil) will find its way into the soil and permeate below until it reaches the water table. It won‚Äôt go any lower than that (because oil less dense than water). Once in the subsurface there are two major concerns. The first is soils vapours. PHCs are volatile, meaning they readily convert into gas through the process of volatilization. Soil vapours will escape towards the surface. They can enter homes, buildings, etc through basements, ventilation, or cracks in the foundation. Soil vapours are hazardous to human health. I‚Äôm not familiar with the specific health effects, just that they are harmful. 

The second concern is the groundwater. If people in the area use groundwater as a drinking source, they will be consuming contaminated water. Needless to say, that‚Äôs bad. 

Ecological impacts from the contamination by this release may range from the deaths of sensitive animal and plants species in the area, and impaired vegetation growth. If sensitive plant species die and nothing is down it can be expected that generalist plants will dominate the area (weeds and grasses). Take this with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm not familiar the ecology of the area. Ideally a field team would go out and assess the risk the contamination poses to the area. Every site is different and must be evaluated as such.

If they keep failing to achieve any significant victories in the next couple of days, it appears as if they will run into some real logistical problems. There's some tweets going around from a (Estonian, I think) government official who stated that Russia can sustain this level of warfare for about 10 days before they run out of some critical supplies/munitions. Additionally, his position at home will be severely weakened by appearing weak and having overplayed his hand. The people in Russia will also start to feel the impact of sanctions after the weekend. Banks being cut off from the global system, markets will tank and the ruble will go down even further. Russia will not be able to import certain type of goods any longer either. 

Best indications available to the public are that Putin was looking for a swift war. Overwhelm the Ukranians, break the resistance, capture Kyiv, install a puppet government, disarm the Ukranian military and leave riot troops to control the situation. Back at home he will control the message, saying Ukraine is liberated, NATO is evil, and because it was a quick campaign the effects on Russia society would be smaller. He clearly had hoped to downplay this invasion, make it seem like a ""technical military"" operation, get some headlines, but only keep it in people's minds for a short time. Instead he's having to shut down twitter and facebook because Russians are sharing stories and images from the horrors of war, and their television channels are being hacked to show pro-Ukranian images and Russian government websites keep being knocked out. Putin's goal was to make the disruption small so that the Russian people could pretend it didn't happen and look away, but the longer this lasts the more noticeable this becomes. I wouldn't be surprised if the anti-war demonstrations in Russia will increase because of this. That can escalate into violence against his own citizenry, sparking turmoil and unrest. This was definitely what Putin had envisioned.

The global appetite for sanctions is also much larger due to the Ukranian resistance quite frankly. Now there are continuous images of shelling and bombings, civilian deaths and all the horrible things that come with war to motivate governments and people to take action. Without such imagery, things might be very different. Had there been a quick success to the Russian campaign and a newly installed Ukranian government saying ""everything is OK"", people around the globe would be reacting differently.

So in a sense there is a ticking clock. Both from a military logistical point of view, as well as from a domestic point of view on how sustainable this campaign is.",False,1645918619.0,t3_t28zy8,t1_hykokq8,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The answer to your question is rather simple. Because those other conflicts lacked a similarly clear picture of good/bad sides. This one is simple to virtually everyone in the world about who is wrong.

Gaddafi, Saddam, Assad, ISIS, and the Taliban, are/were all awful, brutal regimes that consistently did terrible things to their people. However, whether or not the cost of war is worth removing them, is a difficult thing to weigh and there are valid views in different directions. Which is the reason for more mixed opinions on those conflicts.

You'll need to sift through a _lot_ of bullshit, gore, scat, likely child pornography, and everything else... but eventually, you'll find a thread that'll point you in the right direction. It was easier to find these threads when there was an active operation going on.

The threads will have details, and likely links to other boards. 7chan and 888chan were the two I knew of back in the day. Just be aware that there are a lot of _actual_ Nazis on all those boards. Again, my info is very old; I haven't been involved in this scene for a long time.

Maybe another approach would be Twitter? You'd be more likely to find actual info there. Just know that Anonymous is not a single group and doesn't have any true leadership.

---

If you don't want to get into bed with neo-Nazis (I don't blame you; it's hard to get out once you get in), you can try doing this on your own. There's a few different options based on what you want to do:

* You can attempt to send multiple requests to known websites to overwhelm the load balancers and bring the server down. It's best if you use VPNs with randomized endpoints for this. Without access to a botnet, you'd need to coordinate with a larger group of people.

* You can find IP addresses located in Russia and do port scans looking for open ports. If people didn't change their port mappings, you can probably figure out what tools they have installed based on the ports that are open - ex. If port 22 is open, they likely have SSH enabled and you should attempt to exploit known SSH vulnerabilities in case they haven't updated.

* Once you're into a machine, you can do whatever you want. Usually you don't want the other guys to know you're in, so you can maintain your access as long as possible. Microphones, webcams, documents/databases, etc. are all good targets. Web servers are a golden goose, especially if they have usernames/passwords somewhere.

* You have coding skills, so you can write a program which hammers an IP address and use any access you get to deploy it - DIY botnet. Alternatively, you can just try to damage systems; `sudo su; rm -rf / --no-preserve-root; reboot`. (As I'm sure you know, that command is likely to fail at some point, but it'll wreck the system.)

* Some websites are very dumb and don't put restrictions on SQL queries from outside sources. These websites are also usually dumb enough not to make backups.",1645921328.0,1645920784.0,t3_t28zy8,t1_hykv54k,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

You state that like it's some type of secret agent or CIA office feeding info to you, specifically. 

Both sides spew propaganda but so far, Ukraine looks pathetic with all these lies.

Let's see.
1- nato is sll over because the situation is complicated. Most of our puppets ( US ) follow our line. A few have been a bit more reserved and I won't speculate on their reason due to being controversial. 
2- yea the Russian Boys are young men too
3-no one is using nukes...at this time
4- the ghost I'd based on a samurai video game and makes no sense. Snake island as well, men with rifle can't fight boats, they know this, they surrendered, Ukraine may die this week but that doesn't mean all its populace does too, this isn't those boys war
5-idk wtf this is, 100000 idiots spam fuck putin, ghost this n that, people can be skeptical too
6- it's obvious I wouldn't put my top dollar items in front of a fresh stock of javelins...duh
7- thermobaric weapons, whoo big deal, we use em too
8- who knows? But either way they aren't the backbreaker

Thats one of the biggest issues Putin has. He doesn't really want to vanquish his ""enemy"". He wants to bring them back into the fold of mother russia. So he has to be careful in how he is trying to do this which is probably also a large reason for why this operation looks so messy right now.

Honestly, it's a bit of a coin toss right now.  Ukraine's done great, just about the best roll of the dice they could have gotten, while Russia's failed in most ways they've tried (lightning push on multiple fronts, airborne assaults, intimidation tactics, etc.)

That being said, there's still a lot of Russian troops out there, and time left on the clock.  This war will likely go on for weeks, months, or years, and a lot of things can happen.  But time is on the Ukrainians' side, as weapons continue to pour in and the spring thaw approaches, and as sanctions begin to land and bite on the Russian economy.

If Putin is going to win this outright, he has to kill/capture Zelensky (which won't do much, making him a martyr either way), break Ukrainian morale in some decisive way, and make serious territorial gains.  I can see him maybe doing the first, but short of dropping a nuke or two I don't see him achieving the second or third objectives.  Even then, good luck sustaining a prolonged occupation of the country, or installing a puppet leader that won't be hung the moment they get appointed to the position.

In Syria they done the same thing. They seem to have switched back to armor in Columns with not as much air support. They probably thought they would swoop in and run through and the army would collapse like in Afghanistan. I'm incredibly surprised TBH I didn't have that much faith in Ukraine. They can still loose. But so far 4k casualties in three days is nothing to sneeze at. Putin was probably also hoping that after the afghan debacle the west would let it fall.

Unlike Chernobyl a nuclear weapon is designed to make a single explosion and thats basically it, nuclear reactors on the other hand are designed to house constantly decaying nuclear material, which is why nuclear generators are so dangerous as far as radiation goes.

Chernobyl was doubly bad because a fire started inside the reactor with the material, which meant hot air and smoke would carry the nuclear particulates up into the atmosphere and into the clouds which then drifted for thousands of miles over the globe.

At this point, it just seems like sanctions are useless in stopping the bleeding unless it manages to cause a coup.

Putin is bringing a massive 2nd wave, but it'll take another day or so to get there and even that wave doesn't have an adequate supply line. They're equipped for 2 days max and then dead in the water without resupply. This is why Putin will probably brute force this next wave.

Starlink is a new technology where satellites can hand off connections to each other constantly in realtime, so that they can orbit very low and you'll stay connected even though each satellite was only briefly overhead, it just passes you to another satellite as it moves out of view. Because of this short distance, the ping is very fast, and lots of satellites means lots of bandwidth.

It also means that as soon as these new satellites fail, they start to fall out of orbit in weeks/months and burn up in the atmosphere instead of becoming space junk like the old geostationary satellites do.
