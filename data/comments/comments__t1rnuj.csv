Translation of the article here:

The Netherlands supports Ukraine in the war against Russia by supplying the country with two hundred so-called Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. That is stated in a letter to parliament published on Saturday .

Some of the goods have already been shipped, the rest will be shipped as soon as possible, but the Netherlands is ""just like other countries with ""logistical challenges"", write ministers Hoekstra (Foreign Affairs) and Ollongren (Defence).

A Stinger is a portable defense system, recognizable by the large tube that the user carries on his shoulder.

The Netherlands had already promised Ukraine defense equipment such as ammunition, helmets and fencing vests last week. After Russia's invasion on Wednesday and Thursday night, Ukraine came with new requests, ministers said, where this delivery came from. ""A careful assessment against the arms export criteria has taken place for this request, but shortened in view of the exceptional circumstances. The House will be informed about this in the short term.""

The Netherlands had already promised this to Ukraine (and part is already underway):
3,000 battle helmets
2,000 shard vests with associated armor plates
Various defensive weapons, such as metal detectors and weapon location radars
100 sniper rifles with 30,000 pieces of associated ammunition",False,1645863349.0,t3_t1rnuj,t3_t1rnuj,,0,115,0,115,0,0,

They literally privatized their own entire military logistics corps to avoid investing in cultivating a professional logistics workforce in their army, called Oboronservis. Not without controversy, from their Russian wiki:*""In October 2012, information appeared in the print and electronic media that employees of Oboronservis were suspected of fraud in the sale of non-core military assets \[7\] .*

*According to the TFR , employees of the Russian Ministry of Defense chose the most liquid and prestigious objects, plots and shares from the property complex of Oboronservis, including those in Moscow. Then, as a rule, huge budgetary funds were invested in this real estate, after which the property was sold at significantly reduced prices to commercial structures affiliated with Oboronservis. Many real estate objects were bought at the expense of money stolen from Oboronservis itself, according to the investigation \[7\] .*

*The former head of the Department of Property Relations of the Russian Ministry of Defense Evgenia Vasilyeva is involved in the case, from whom 3 million rubles , jewelry and antiques were confiscated during the search .""*

Russia literally fucking sacrificed their own military effectiveness to the altar of greed. That's how you know this whole house of cards is ready to collapse at some point. If that's not some Mafia state pathetic weakness like that I don't know what is, but it involves more greed.

By sending paratroopers to an area bordering Poland (which is helping send weapons to Ukraine), Russia may be hoping to stop or threaten the flow of weapons.

Another possible reason for deploying troops to Brody is to sabotage the Odessa–Brody pipeline, which is geopolitically important and which Russia opposes. Russia may also see this as an opportunity to make Ukrainians feel unsafe even in regions they thought were relatively safe.

Their economy has been in shambles, brain drain on epic proportions, and an insane fleet of rapidly aging soviet era equipment.

And ever since covid they've been dealing with many of the same supply chain issues as everyone else, so lots of that maintenance got deferred even further.

Does Putin have more tricks up his sleeve? Sure, but this isn't Russia just piddling around, they're having a hard time because they can't maintain all of their equipment and reliably deploy it everywhere they need to.

> Bit of my own analysis on the apartment hit.
> 
> Looks like it was possibly a Kaliber that was either improperly aimed or the missile was confused on where it was and it initiated its terminal supersonic motor late.
> 
> If you look at the videos the flight path has it coming from the southwest, directly over Sikorsky Airport's main terminal, which was most likely the primary target. There is nothing on the other side of the apartment in the same flight path that has any value.
> 
> Given that all of the Kalibers are ship launched at the moment and no one reported an aircraft in the immediate area this seems like the most likely scenario. The missile came from the Black Sea, traveled inland northwest, and then dog-legged to the northeast.

Additional analysis:

The only Kaliber that does a terminal boost mode is the anti-shipping variant.

This presents an interesting scenario, while the land attack version of the Kaliber has all the modern land-attack guidance systems seen in Tomahawk and other cruise missile systems, the anti-ship version has inertial guidance and terminal active radar guidance, as in it engages an onboard radar to seek out a target. When it sees a target and gets within range it engages a high-energy rocket motor that drives the warhead at nearly Mach 3 into the ship.

The problem is this doesn't really work against land targets as there is too much clutter. It is very possible that the missile hitting that building thought it was engaging a ship since a building would easily look like the side of a ship.

So this presents two options in my mind:

1. The ship that launched this missile fucked up and fired the wrong type of missile.
1. The Russians are out of the land attack variant (or at least this ship is) and are trying to make due with the anti-ship variant which is _not_ appropriate for this type of targeting.",1645863792.0,1645863689.0,t3_t1rnuj,t3_t1rnuj,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

The US took more than a month to ""liberate"" Iraq, and that was against a demoralized, out dated military with *no one* backing it. We don't even need to talk about what happened after because it was only the beginning of two decades of guerilla war.

Ukraine has the backing of NATO, modern equipment, and a military that doesn't just surrender the moment it is challenged. The idea that its cities would fall within a week is absurd.

Modern militaries are great at destroying. From ballistic missiles to carpet bombs, they are incredibly destructive and can reduce cities and even countries to ruins in a matter of days or weeks.

But taking and holding cities without destroying them? Occupation? That requires boots on the ground, house to house combat, and pacifying the population. No one is great at doing this, especially if you can't control the flow of foreign aid, which Russia most definitely cannot because NATO is still supplying Ukraine with intelligence, aid, and weapons.

So I think we can establish that the attempt to capture Ukraine's cities was quite desperate and stupid.

The more interesting question is what objective Putin and his generals were trying to achieve. Originally, the belief was that they were trying to create a distraction while they took over the contested regions to the east, where they at least have a solid chance of holding. But then the attack on Ukraine's capital, and multiple cities in the south... Did they get greedy? Did they suddenly think they had a chance to take it all? If so, that was a terrible mistake, and it will likely cost them the war.",1645865965.0,1645865808.0,t3_t1rnuj,t3_t1rnuj,,0,48,0,48,1,0,

Not all the 200.000 soldiers there are primary combat forces. They also have lots of less trained conscripts sitting there to control the occupied space. Well, so far they sent in their fighting force, which didn’t achieve much yet, for a matter of fact, their most valuable troops suffer heavy losses (shot down planes, helicopters, transports with lots of paratroopers). The main reason the rest of the troops weren’t deployed is the simple fact that there is nothing to occupy yet. 

Let’s see how this keeps playing out but the Russians really don’t do well. They only covered a fraction of the Ukrainian territory and already lost an unproportional amount of troops for that little gain. This is not sustainable. And there is no indicator that predicts that occupied areas will remain peaceful.

> ""During the night, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a strike with long-range precision weapons using air- and sea-launched cruise missiles against Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a video statement.

Civilisation, *true* civilisation, occurs when we overcome our base animal urges and recognise the wider group of our species. Normal people in civilised society don't kill, or steal, or rape.

In the modern world it is absolutely inexcusable to attack your peaceful, prosperous neighbour over unsubstantiated fear and spark the highest stakes war in decades. There is little place for all-out war at the best of times, and this goes well beyond the limits of rationality or reason.

The whole world needs to understand that Putin is the one responsible for this, even if it is in the name of Russia, and that he presents a very real existential danger to everyone. There is something very, very wrong with him and his inexplicable actions. He presents the danger of a generation to the whole world. The Ukranians, of course, all of Europe and NATO too, but also the people of China, the people of India, and a dozen other countries that align themselves with his regime. Most of all, he represents a danger to his own people, and not just the man on the street but every member of the Russian elite. He does not represent their interests any longer and the sooner they realise that, and the sooner they replace him, the sooner this can be de-escalated. His direct supporters need to understand that unless they take action and appoint a new, rational leader. *Anybody*, even Lavrov or Medvedev would be a better option right now.

So everything the west is doing now probably isn’t really hurting him much as the west is doing exactly what he expected they’d do. 

Which raises the question… what can the west do that genuinely will throw Putin off and mess up his plans? The only thing guaranteed to stop an invasion is military force, but the west has pretty much made clear that that is not going to happen due to the enormous cost (both financially and to human life) and possibility of nuclear escalation (although I don’t think nuclear escalation is as guaranteed as people are saying it is - MAD still applies during war).

The Ukrainians are holding out really well, so constantly supplying them with western military hardware in order to make the invasion as costly as possible for the Russians seems to be the current strategy, but I don’t think this will be enough to save Ukraine or prevent any further invasions (as I’m sure Putin is eyeing up Eastern Europe and Georgia).",False,1645863605.0,t3_t1rnuj,t3_t1rnuj,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

Trumps - elections get supposedly influenced by russian hackers to fall in his favor (rumours/investigation process hindered by his administration)

-trump has unrecorded/untranslated visits with putin of which no complete documentation exists.

Now when he loses the re-election , bonds between russia and the us rapidly deteriorate. 

I imagine putin expected trump to sit his full term, as is usual for most us presidents.

Now what i can’t stop asking myself: Did Trump give Putin the go ahead to invade ukraine in one of these unrecorded meetings?

We would still be on trumps term right now if he would not have lost.

This thread covers the draft going into effect in Ukraine. They're forcibly pulling in every man aged 18-60 that they can. Most have no training and that type of soldier is historically known for basically being cannon fodder. I don't think Ukraine is being crushed but it does seem like things are getting desperate. Messages over radios giving instructions on how to make maltovs is not something happening when you feel confident of your place in the war. I've seen multiple (UNCONFIRMED) cases of friendly fire from inexperienced people. That Ukrainian tank that ran over a car (for reasons not clear- accident or misunderstanding).

Don't take this as some Russian propaganda. I want Ukraine to win. Putin can suck on my sack.

That hurts close to my heart. 

At the end of the day, no matter the uniform, when you serve in an armed service, the enemy isn't personal. It's a result of a political decision. They are just like you. Young men and women, who may wear a different coloured uniform, and a different flag. We're all warriors, who fight warriors. **(A principle that used to be taught to simplify the law of armed conflict.)**

I feel bad that he was put in the situation to surrender like that. **It is a critical failure of leadership.** 

Willingness to withstand the shocks of war. That is an important thing the military teaches you, and trains you for. Not just running, shooting, jumping through hoops of fire and wrangling sharks with a knife in your teeth but the ability to keep a cool head and rationality in stressful situations.

As an officer, you are taught to take care of your troops. They are yours, and a special responsibility from your country. They are in your care. You ultimately make the decisions, the big decisions. You decide who has to go first through the door, or who has to carry the water. **Your decisions, may cost them their lives, that's why you get the big bucks. That and the responsibility to lead from the front, and put yourself as well in harms way.** 

To simply have one of your soldiers surrender like that, is a professional failing. That young man's officers failed him. They failed to take care of him. Letting him surrender, alone, confused. That is a grievous sin and a breach of a bond of trust that you have with your troops. 

They failed to train him, motivate him, and take care of him. They also abandoned him. It's one thing, if you're outnumbered, outgunned and hopeless, it's one thing if it's over. Just to have a single soldier surrender like that.

As a professional, it makes me sad, a lot sadder than a lot of the other videos, and I feel bad for the kid, as it's the worst sort of failure imaginable. Any officer, of any armed forces should feel ashamed. 

If that is how the Russians train, equip and  take care of their soldiers today, I feel bad for all of them. *Lions lead by donkeys wasn't it?*",False,1645869595.0,t3_t1rnuj,t1_hyht9e0,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

It’s not fearless, fear is there. It just more surrender of the mind. You prepare this in your mind psychologically during the build up and days leading to getting to the conflict. For example when we went into Iraq I had months to go through all the emotions I needed to, to be able to surrender my mind and focus on my Job. 
The videos of the Russians Soldiers surrendering and all Videos I see leads me to believe the reports they didn’t realize it was an actual invasion, or was told last minute what was happening. They all have seem utterly confused/shocked and just frankly just mentally unprepared for what they are doing (taking lives) (people dying around them). 
You ever wonder how a solider can see his comrades die in the middle of battle but continue functioning. That’s the mental aspect, the fog of war. 

The Ukrainians seem determined mentally prepared. They have known for months this was happening. They said their goodbyes to their family and friends not knowing if they would see them again. They surrender everything mentally when they left their family. 
The Russians seems like they left their family saying “see you in a month, going to training near Ukraine”. 

The mental aspect of war in huge, that’s why propaganda is so effective. That’s why creating a false narrative (or real one in Ukraines case) is important.

What desperation lol. Their energy and commodity sectors are untouched by sanctions so far. And we all know that most of their revenue comes from these energy sectors. 

Secondly, the idea that Putin sent in canon fodder first is not just pure speculation. Both the US and UK intelligence have stated that the Russian invasion will occur in phases, with better troops and equipments getting involved in each subsequent phase.

People use the it's too expensive to rebuild line and that's not an excuse. Putin flatten Grozny to the ground. Literally shelled Grozny into dust.

Go look at mid to late 2000 videos of OMON operations in Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and you will immediately notice that Russia soldiers do no hesitate to use overwhelming firepower. Islamist fighters shoot at me from their house? Well OMON's gonna roll up in a BTR or BMP and turn your house into a pile of bricks with autocannon fire. Or they'll just shoot a thermobaric RPG into a window and take everybody out. They don't even bother risking their life and breaching the building.

Even during the 2014 invasion of Crimea they went further. They immediately cut phone lines to cell towers and jammed cell and radio communications. They even shocked the west by bringing out their long range electronic warfare transmitter, they provided over the horizon jamming across the electromagnetic spectrum. They literally freaked out NATO cuz nobody in the West had an equivalent. 

So from a war analysis perspective it has been very very odd to see Russian soldiers being super polite to civilians shittalking them and to Matthew Chance of CNN when he stumbled on to the VDV guys at Antonov airport.

Blitz Kyiv, install a puppet government, claim it was to defend Russian speaking citizens, and demilitarise Ukraine/bully them away from NATO.

Unfortunately for Putin, the West shone a big spotlight on it and Ukraine held (and is currently still holding) the line. The international world rallied against him diplomatically and economically while Ukraine made a laughing stock of his military (partially due to Putin's plan requiring a ""soft"" touch, keeping the infrastructure in tact).

From what I can tell, Putin didn't want a war in Ukraine. His plan was to blitz Kyiv, decapitate the government and cry ""look what you made me do!"" in the international arena. Now he's kinda fucked; Russian troops aren't prepared for a lengthy engagement, they can't sustain an occupation and an installed government will not be recognised by anyone (least of all the now very pissed off Ukrainians).

Where are the fuel convoys? Tanks burn 2-gallons per mile. A convoy of 20 tanks traveling 30 miles will need 1200 gallons of fuel. We're not even counting bullets, food, or other equipment here.

Is Russia seriously thinking about actually attacking Kyiv here? I mean, nominally they are since they clearly launched expensive missiles at the city. But no sane person could say that Russian Forces have secured the area for fuel-convoys to safely be stationed anywhere near Kyiv. The Ukrainian's army is small, but they're hiding everywhere. It only will take one good attack to blow up the supplies, and an entire Tank battalion becomes a fuel-less hunk of 70-ton junk (good luck moving 70 tons of armor without fuel).

---------

This Russian ""Blitzkrieg"" strategy is mind-boggling to me. Its difficult for me to logically understand what the fuck is even going on, because it looks like a colossal mistake on Russian planning.

Or is the Russian plan to like, walk up to Ukrainian gas stations and hope there's enough gas for them and their tanks?

Supply lines win wars. It doesn't even look like Russia has even established the basics here before charging into Kyiv. Russians need to advance, dig in (protect the flanks), fortify, bring in fuel. Then leap-frog forward. That's how you make territorial gains.

Instead, we're seeing this Russian blitzkrieg for the capital with no fallbacks, or assurances that their vulnerable fuel supplies are protected. You need to clear the area, establish perimeters, etc. etc. These operations take time, time that the Russians clearly haven't been doing if they're this far into the country already.

------

To retake that lost land, all the Ukrainians need to do is counter-shell the fuel supplies and ammo-supplies of the Russian troops. No gasoline, no bullets, no war. They'd be forced to retreat. Sure, Russians can move those supplies around and try to hide them from the enemy, but movement of supplies costs fuel (meaning you can only do those operations if you already have a solid supply line).",1645864786.0,1645864377.0,t3_t1rnuj,t1_hyhrp6b,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

I think his major problem is that he expected more Russian support at all levels for their return to being the 2nd world power, but that ship has sailed.

Even if they retook all of the former USSR land, they still wouldn't be more powerful than the US, China, or the EU. They essentially missed their chance on the world stage because their ""empire"" was too short lived to handle the Cold War. Russia is certainly a powerful nation, but not to the level that Putin wants.

But at this point, cutting them off is also a nice punch in the face making sure Russia suffers from it long-term making sure everyone knows, if you fuck around, good luck staying a superpower

However, the longer it lasts, the more it's in the news.  Politicians thrive on pushing off issues.  ""oh we'll make a statement shortly"" or ""well we need to think about it"" and so on.  If the war is over quickly, well then it looks like that's unfortunate and we'll have to assess how to deal with this new situation.

But every day ukraine can drag the war out is another day a lot of people continue to be put on the spot with ""well what are you doing about this"" while other countries ramp up sanctions and the like with major support since it's fresh in their minds.

If Ukraine was also a NATO member at that point, any counter attack could risk bringing the other members in.

Putin sees this possibility, and because his advisors are filled with yes men, they all agree with his assessment, forming an echo chamber in which he believes that he has to head things off before it gets to that point. The yes men tell him it's a good idea, as currently Ukraine would buckle almost instantly, sanctions would be estimated to be somewhat mild.

Even if it were a real surrender from Zelensky personally, Ukrainians probably are so pissed off that they wouldn't surrender in that situation.

-------

Insurgency would be bad though, as it risks warlords / fractured troops / strongmen taking over the Ukrainian forces. Ideally, Zelensky stays alive, the Ukrainians remain rallied as a unified force and they beat Russia conventionally. If that can't be accomplished, IMO, its highly important that Zelensky successfully leaves the country and becomes a government-in-exile. The man needs to be alive after living though these hard days.

USA supplied plenty of insurgents back in the 80s. They were called the mujahideen, who eventually started calling themselves the Taliban. This ""give weapons out to people who ask"" business is surprisingly difficult, the USA should not repeat its mistakes.

Zelensky is clearly a good guy to give our weapons to. A shattered and angry mob of Ukrainians who take over after a Russian atrocity may not be the best people for USA to supply however.

The correct victory, and I must stress that it *would* be a political victory for Russia, is to negotiate a ceasefire, de-escalate, and move from there. If that means that Russian troops occupy the area east of the Dnipro River without an exchange of fire for several months, whilst a long-term strategy is worked out, which may or may not include the handover of the Donbas for the benefit of the wider world, so be it. If that means Russia stages a full and total withdrawal, even better. Either way, it achieves their true aim - to get Ukraine to the negotiating table on equally favourable terms. If Russia is seen to come to terms with its invasion as being the wrong path, that will win it back a lot of respect on the world stage. If they press on with military action, they will make themselves a pariah for decades to come even in the very best outcome.

>  
>The 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, also known as the 1993 October Coup, Black October, the Shooting of the White House or Ukase 1400, was a political stand-off between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by military force.  
  
The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The power struggle reached its crisis on 21 September 1993, when President Yeltsin intended to dissolve the country's highest body (Congress of People's Deputies) and parliament (Supreme Soviet), although the constitution did not give the president the power to do so. Yeltsin justified his orders by the results of the referendum of April 1993.  
  
In response, the parliament declared the president's decision null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president. On 3 October, demonstrators removed militia cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the Ostankino television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of 4 October by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance. At the climax of the crisis, Russia was thought by some to be ""on the brink"" of civil war.\[1\]\[2\] The ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in Moscow's history since the Russian Revolution.\[3\]  
  
According to the General Prosecutor's Office, 147 people were killed and 437 wounded.

The reason they are so reluctant is (a) because they have been in office about 2 months and (b) because they cannot undo what our government has done before.

They are being criticized by internationals and Germans alike but I think many people are blind to how difficult it is for them. Again, I‘m all for banning Russia from Swift. I also want Germany to send weapons to Ukraine.

Banning Russia from Swift will have consequences for all of us. Many fear a Euro recession. German banks will suffer a lot. Economically Germany is important to Europe and Germany fears it might take hits it cannot recover from which would hurt Europe. Please inform yourself before you beg for sanctions. This will hurt. However, this a something we must do because it is right. If we suffer for that, so be it. 

However, I just find it very simple-minded to fault the government for that. Many factors play into this. I don‘t agree with their actions but I know why they‘re so hesitant. 

And by the way they approved. They’re currently trying to figure out how to soften the blow to the German economy. Please also fact-check the claims people post on this thread.",False,1645868922.0,t3_t1rnuj,t1_hyhwl01,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

There are plenty of stories of brothers fighting on the opposite sides of the American Civil War when regiments were raised in the same states.  There are countless examples like that. 

It is about building a story, people will fight if they believe it (true or not) Putin has failed in that by speed tracking it without building a foundation. 

Had he spent few months creating and showing the world media some brutal violence in Donbas by ""ukranians"", he would have stronger support at home and lesser opposition abroad. Both the american counter PR campaign by disclosing his plans ahead of time and his lack of media prep has made support for this weak. 

Georgia 2007 did not create this negative press and had more support in Russia because he exploited south Ossetia and Abkhazia long running issues in Georgia to expand.

That said, only one of Putin's options can really lead to de escalation, rolling back to Donetsk and Luhansk. But that would show a defeat to him, and he's still on the hook for all this other shit he's trying to pull. 

You may be right about the morale of Russian troops but I don't think military intervention would come in a confrontation with those troops. Ukrainians can handle them. Coalition forces would likely hit logistical targets only and maybe some naval forces and armour columns.

He sincerely wants Ukraine to be a part of Russia, given his success in 2014 he likely thought he could do a repeat. Using ground troops to disable infrastructure instead of bombing and missiles backs the thought that he wishes Ukraine to be a permanent part of Russia. If intent is to annex better to disable maybe a few key parts of facilities that can later be replaced then destroy outright and have to rebuild.

The lack of outright blanket bombing backs this up too. Wide spread destruction may speed up capitulation to Russia but would unify and build hatred leading to prolonged insurgency.

His tactics seem to be utilise conscripts for the start and special forces for strategic ops.

,t1rnuj,hyhtayg,"What you're seeing now is pretty accurate, but probably much slower advance overall. There'd be way more precise bombing of military compounds and encampment. Anti air defenses would still be targeted, but have much better defense. You'd definitely be seeing some form or another of dog fighting in the skies followed by combat in the water and around ports.

Infantry combat would be more spread out and methodical as a result of each side having increasingly more dangerous toys to use. Probably more focus on choke points and funneling vs open land as both sides have impressive long range capability and drones to spot or designate.

Much like Ukraine, there'd be less fighting in massive cities or urban centers and more combat in smaller cities that are evacuated or present a significant military advantage. Capitals and population centers would be used as holdouts for any defending force because the difficulty of urban combat. Think fighting in Hue City during Vietnam, now imagine modern day IED, traps, bombs, drones, thermal optics, proper night vision, tac lasers, and most infantry (at least in the US) are using suppressors to lower sound profiles and muzzle flash.

Overall military knowledge and skill sets in the average rifleman is *significantly* better than the WWII or Vietnam Era. Your base package marine rifleman now has the combat effectiveness of nearly a single squad of Marines in 1940s and the knowledge/skillset of a Marine Raider or that version of a special operations. They're smarter, faster, stronger, and more disciplined than before, meaning everything that is done will be more methodical and thought out.

A modern war would be an odd combination of incredibly slow, but also incredibly fast. Losses would be disgustingly high on all sides considering the lethality of our technology and service members. It wouldn't be pretty or fun, and it wouldn't end very quickly either. 

It also depends a lot on *where* it's happening. Invade the US and every other house has a gun or two and some *very* angry Americans. Invade the UK/Ireland and you'll have even angrier people who lack guns, but will beat, stab, and car bomb the shit out of your invading force even if it means dying in the millions. Invade France and you'll have a lovely vacation home to relax in and just when you get comfy, the residents of every city and farm will collectively burn you alive and spread your ashes into piles of manure to help grow crops that the Frenchman will need when they up and invade your ass for fucking with their free time.",False,1645865129.0,t3_t1rnuj,t1_hyhrs5o,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Always remember: The longer a war goes on, it's ALWAYS worse for the invader than the defenders. We're already seeing that as Russian tanks run out of fuel and soldiers are having to barter or beg for food from the locals. Meanwhile, Ukrainians are on their home turf and have everything they need as well as international assistance pouring in.

I do feel eventually Russia may start making inroads, but they are going to have to fight tooth and nail for every single inch they get.

I think Putin's fear of NATO has more to do with a fear of the US, given their long history of attempted regime change (Latin America, Cuba, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq). You're right the NATO doesn't really do regime change, but the US does.

The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.  
Strategy  
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.  
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.  
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.  
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.  
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.  
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.  
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.  
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.  
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.  
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.  
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.  
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.  
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.  
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.  
For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.  
They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.  
The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.  
A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted  
A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.  
This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.  
The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.  
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.  
Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.  
The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.",False,1645866587.0,t3_t1rnuj,t1_hyhv0h7,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
