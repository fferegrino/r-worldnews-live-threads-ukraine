>**SPIEGEL**: How can Putin be stopped?
>#
>**Zelenskyj**: We talked to the European heads of state and government every day and said: call him, stop him, stop his troops.  I warned: Give us many weapons.  I had also called for preventive weapons and sanctions.  If everyone knew that Putin was going to invade our country, why didn't they impose sanctions?  It's absolutely ridiculous when you all stand up for us publicly and still like to dodge sanctions or withhold guns.  I see it as dirty politics: you know Russia is historically losing this war, but you still refuse to help Ukraine in case – with a one percent chance – Russia wins.  Because then you can say to Putin: Do you remember?  I slowed down a bit back then!” And that's exactly what I don't like about politics: talking about values ​​and then devaluing them through your actions.
>#
>**SPIEGEL:** We assume you mean Germany.  Have you been frustrated by hesitant German politics?
>#
>**Selenskyj:** Our relationship with Germany runs in waves, so to speak, it's an up and down. It was very difficult for me at the beginning, the temperaments are quite different.  I'm naturally a fast person.  Others are slower, which may also be due to their bureaucracy.  In our country I smashed them.  Because we have no time to waste.  During war there are no 60 seconds in a minute.  Every second represents a person's life, their destiny.  We don't have weeks or months.  Suddenly, however, this conservative attitude changed and I received support from the Chancellor, I can confirm that.  Then I finally got support from Steinmeier, with whom I had had difficulties before, mainly because of the so-called Steinmeier formula...
>#
>**SPIEGEL:** That concerned the Minsk peace process, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was one of its architects.  He also helped shape Germany's Russia policy as head of the Chancellery and then as Foreign Minister.
>#
>**Zelenskyj:** I think we all did a good job.  I don't just mean our side, but also the German side.  We have changed our relationships and understanding.  We got Iris-T anti-aircraft systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.  They saved a lot of lives.  I said to the chancellor: Olaf, listen, we're short on rockets.  I know that you don't have any more yourself, we also have an intelligence service.  I know you give us everything you have.  And I don't know how, but he actually managed to get them produced faster.  That was positive.  Only now we are again in a difficult phase with this debate about the German tanks, it is emotional and complex.  I have to put pressure on him to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not for us, but for Europeans.  Putin's power rests on victories and conquests.
>#
>**SPIEGEL:** You believe that Vladimir Putin won't stop after Ukraine.
>#
>**Zelenskyj**: You can't stop him, because Putin is a dragon that has to eat.  To satisfy his appetite you give him one land after another, or at least pieces of them.  And their people shout: ""Forward!  Stuff him some more!  Go!” But in today's world, neither borders nor oceans will stop the Russians.  I am absolutely sure of that.  I told a head of state who felt offended by me - and I have to say it wasn't Olaf - that delivering ten tanks made no sense.  What I meant: It's not about the number of tanks and there's no point in haggling over it.  Rather, this is a political decision, just like the sanctions.  Tank deliveries only mean that we are all united against Russian aggression.  And tomorrow it won't be tanks, it will be planes or something else.  Once the Russians get to your border, you will have to sacrifice your people's lives.

You would be right to wonder where they are going, and the unlikely answer is Ukraine — by way of Baltimore; then onto a cargo ship, which leaves port on March 8, then sails across the Atlantic, through the Mediterranean, into the Adriatic and to the port of Koper in Slovenia; then onto flatbed trucks bound probably through Hungary and Slovakia, where the ambulances will arrive at their new homes in Ukraine.

Two days ago we learned about the 10th Russian general killed in the war, a VDV ""Major General"" Dmitry Ulianov. His rank is in quotes because he was only a general while retired. He commanded a VDV division as a colonel, and then took a bump to Major General when he retired in 2017, that being the next rank up from Colonel. Last year Ulianov apparently volunteered for the sPeCiAl mIliTaRy oPeraTioN and came back as a Colonel again. 

He was reportedly killed on the night of Feb 4-5 and was commanding ""volunteers from Tatarstan"". There were no details on the specific regiment he commanded, or where he was killed. 

Now there are lots of obituaries suddenly coming out the very same Tatarstan, many linked to the volunteer battalion ""Alga"", a part of the 72nd brigade from the 3rd army corps. They were apparently deployed to Vuhledar ""about a week ago"". 

This suggests that Russian losses were exactly as devastating as the battlefield videos showed, and that the vaunted ""elite"" Naval Infantry was completely destroyed within just a few short days. 

> It is another indicator that both 155th and 40th brigades are no longer capable to perform significant assaults, which is why the enemy uses ethnic battalions and mobilized, to retain some pressure. The results are predictably disastrous. 

If their replacements immediately lost their C/O, this puts even more context behind the pathetically inept tactics Russians have displayed at Vuhledar in the last few days.

>Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 9 February 2023

>(1/4) The weather continues to play a significant role in the course of Russia’s war in Ukraine. With the ground frozen, there has likely been little change in cross country mobility (CCM) conditions in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks.

>(2/4) On 08 February 2023, surface temperatures were around 0 degrees Celsius; over the coming week, forecasts suggest soil temperature increases and snow melt are likely to deteriorate CCM across the Donbas.

>(3/4) CCM is likely to be at its worst, with extremely muddy conditions, over mid- to late-March. Commanders on both sides will highly likely seek to avoid scheduling major offensives at such times.

>(4/4) However, perceived political or operational opportunities can override such concerns, as demonstrated by Russia launching its invasion in late-February 2022.",False,1675925336.0,t3_10xkszp,t3_10xkszp,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

Ukrainian have such vastly superior recon capability and their artillery is so much more responsive and precise, Russians can't hope to even stage enough equipment for a decent-sized attack.

> **Ukraine’s Allies Pressured Berlin Into Allowing Tank Shipments—Then Started Dragging Their Feet**

>BERLIN—For months, Germany withstood international pressure to allow neighbors to supply Ukraine with German-made tanks. **Yet since Berlin finally yielded last month, only one country in Europe has has agreed to dispatch a sizeable contigent.**

>European allies’ reluctance to make good on earlier signals despite intense lobbying from Berlin in recent days is raising doubt that enough tanks can arrive in Ukraine in time for an expected Russian offensive.

>It is also leaving Germany’s government in an awkward position it has sought to avoid: becoming the sole purveyor of a large contingent of Western-made main battle tanks for Ukraine. Since the start of the war, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made a point of coordinating weapon deliveries with allies.[...]

>So far, only Germany and Poland have approved substantial deliveries of tanks for Kyiv—around 200 and 74, respectively, including a mixture of new and older models. Canada has committed four modern German-made tanks. 

>When Germany said last month that it would authorize allies to re-export German-made tanks to Ukraine after weeks of resisting the demand from Kyiv and other European capitals, the move was expected to unleash a slew of commitments by neighbors to dig into their own stocks of Leopard 2s, which military experts consider one of the best-performing tanks in the world, and of the older Leopard 1s. 

>There are more than 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks in European stocks, yet besides Berlin only Warsaw so far has committed to send any of them to Kyiv, along with 60 other tanks based on Soviet models, while Lisbon has pledged three.

>Mr. Scholz, who only yielded after President Biden also committed to donate U.S. tanks, has been calling his European counterparts in an effort to secure commitments, German officials said.

>The diplomatic push notched its first success on Tuesday when the Netherlands and Denmark committed to help finance the purchase of around 100 decommissioned Leopard 1 tanks that are now owned by German companies Rheinmetall AG and FFGmbH. The Leopard 1 was decommissioned in Germany two decades ago but private firms and other governments still own an undisclosed number of the older tanks.[...]

>Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa told parliament on Thursday that his country was carrying out maintenance on Leopard 2 tanks and would deliver three vehicles in March, according to local media.

> Among the other countries that **initially signaled they might send tanks to Ukraine if Germany allowed it are Finland, Sweden, Belgium and Spain. Those countries haven’t so far made any commitment,** although officials from some of them have said they would work together with allies on training and financing.

>The Spanish government was assessing how it could help the tank initiative, Defense Minister Margarita Robles told reporters last month. “While it is true Spain has Leopards, the vast majority of those which could be delivered, need to undergo an upgrade,” she said at the time. Her spokeswoman didn’t reply to a request for comment.

> **A spokesman for the Belgian government said the country had no tanks to give**[....]A senior NATO official said Finland signaled it would most likely hold direct tank deliveries **until it officially joins the alliance**, a move that is currently being blocked by Turkey.

Some Ukrainian sources say there's as much as 500K mobiks, but even if it's *only* 300K plus 1,800 tanks, 4K AFVs, and 700 a/c this is a major escalation by Russia. As bad as the past year has been, Russians are about to deploy more troops and equipment than Ukraine has seen since 1944. 

My only explanation is that Russians were a lot more strategic than they let on. Once they realized how badly they fucked up and needed to mobilize, they moved Gerasimov into the shadows to oversee the ""good"" part of mobilization and put Surovkin up front with a ""hold the line at all costs"" order. They gave Surovkin multiple sacrificial mobik regiments to burn, which he happily did. 

Vuhledar was likely the first test of Gerasimov's troops, and we all know how that went. However the sheer numbers really need to be appreciated.

Even with conservative OSINT numbers (~1500), for the 1800 tanks figure to be accurate Russia would have to send every single working tank out of the country.  They can't do that.  They defend the longest border in the world.  There's no way they wouldn't have 500-600 tanks at bases along the borders with China, Finland, etc., no matter how much chuff they allocate for the war.  The same can be said of helicopters, as they are much more useful outside combat and can't be as easily pulled from defensive duty.

For those whom my concocted analogy has escaped, what I mean is that Russia is nowhere near able to project the kind of power they think they can.

Sure, a couple of rich talking heads like Putin and Medvedev bet the whole country on it, but the whole country -- by very nature of what kind of ""citizens"" Putin has helped foster (translation: _general apathy_) -- certainly doesn't have the patience or will to do things like turn Moldova. It's Russian fantasy which _may_ have been dangerously realizable prior to their absolutely telegraphed and failed invasion, now it's just insanity rolling of its own momentum pushed by the Kremlin.

The headlines make it sound like it's about the radio controlled small range drones, but I believe that's wrong and is just clickbait to rile people up. I believe to date Starlink has only been used for communication on the front lines not to aid weapons systmes directly.  It is reasonable for Starlink to take the position that their equipment is not directly used as the guidance system for long range bombs.

>A decade ago, Hersh was one of the most respected investigative journalists on the planet, having broken major stories from the My Lai massacre in 1969 to the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2004. But more recently, his reports have become less and less credible. He's claimed that much of the US special forces is controlled by secret members of Opus Dei, that the US military flew Iranian terrorists to Nevada for training, and that the 2013 chemical weapons attack in Syria was a ""false flag"" staged by the government of Turkey. Those reports have had little proof and, rather than being borne out by subsequent investigations, have been either unsubstantiated or outright debunked.

The UK and France tried to do that when they decolonized. It often doesn’t work well because countries that were colonized at one point tend to hold a grudge for quite a few generations, heck even the US and UK had a grudge that didn’t go away until after the Civil War. 

Every country wants the other countries to be friendly towards them and their interests, so influencing foreign politics is just considered part of foreign policy. However, the rules have been set since WWII that outright conquest is against the rules. That destabilizes the political situation too much and promotes a larger war as countries fight for their existence. That’s why Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not been tolerated. 

Afghanistan and Iraq were slightly different situations. Afghanistan’s government was harboring a group that had just directly attacked the US, and that government was believed to be complicit in the attack. Thus, the US could justify an invasion to destroy the group that attacked them and the government that harbored them. 

Iraq was a trickier case, closer to the one Russia attempted to create to justify invading Ukraine. With Iraq, there was a history of belligerence towards its neighbors (see Iran-Iraq war and Gulf War) and oppressing its people (the Shia majority and Kurdish minority). The US did trump up the case that Saddam Hussein was plotting to attack his neighbors again to justify the invasion, but at least the history was there for all to see. That’s why all that emphasis was put on the claims that Saddam Hussein was attempting to obtain WMDs. He’d only want those if he was planning to attack a neighbor again or use them on his own people. 

However, none of those justifications worked for Ukraine. Ukraine had never been belligerent towards its neighbors or own people. Everyone in the region was neutral to or liked Ukraine’s government, even when it was more Russian-friendly.

“It’s not like a trigger mechanism. It doesn’t mean that tomorrow every single country in NATO responds with a full military invasion of Russia,” Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of State, said.
The diplomatic nature of an Article 5 invocation is by design. It allows the alliance the necessary pause and diplomatic toolkit to respond to an aggression on its own terms.

“If you think about it, if [it’s a trigger mechanism], you’ve given Russia all control over the battlefield. They decide when there is a war. They decide whether or not we get involved. No. We have control. We have agency over what our actions are,” Rubin said.
“Article Five is an incredibly powerful diplomatic tool. So it gives options for a  Polish response. That’s what it does. It gives options. It doesn’t give requirements,” Rubin said.”
