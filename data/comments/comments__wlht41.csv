Day 169 of my updates from Kharkiv.

There was no shelling today, or rather no shelling directly aimed at the city. At 8pm and 10pm people started seeing illumination munitions being fired in Kharkiv oblast, very close to the city, basically on the outskirts. Then a bit later the real shelling started, which caused a fire, right at the place where the illumination was seen in the air, not much is known other than that though.

Now we know where yesterday’s missiles landed, well, at least where some of them landed. One landed somewhere in the center of the city, in a yard between apartment buildings. It damaged every building around, including an office building. Almost every window was blown out; some people living there said that they woke up because the entire window frame fell on them, lying in bed, after it was blown away from the explosion. 

Even though the destruction was pretty bad, thankfully there were no casualties, nobody even got injured. No military equipment was damaged either, because there is none in a yard in between apartment complexes. They also fired some missiles today, at 2:50am, most likely 4, but some explosions sounded weird again, so people thought that there were more, up to 6. So far we don’t know what was hit, but they aimed at 3 separate districts.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 11 August 2022
 
- Russia is highly unlikely to be capable of fulfilling some export orders for armoured fighting vehicles because of the exceptional demand for vehicles for Russia's own forces in Ukraine, and the increasing effect of Western sanctions.

- Belarus has recently released details of a new domestically upgraded T-72B main battle tank (MBT). Belarus probably developed this alternative solution in place of an MBT modification programme previously contracted to Russian state-owned company UralVagonZavod.

- Russia has long considered the defence industry to be one of its most important export successes. However, its military industrial capacity is now under significant strain, and the credibility of many of its weapon systems has been undermined by their association with Russian forces' poor performance in the Ukraine war.

This is exactly what Ukraine has been doing and between that and clinical tactical and strategic decisions (an amazing demonstration of Defence-in-depth); this war will be studied in detail for decades and probably centuries.

This type of warfare isn't new and is practiced by many non-US allied nations, and has been for years. Examples include Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But it has also been practiced by many assymetrical forces such as Viet Cong (Vietnam War).

The fact that Ukraine has done it so efficiently is a credit to their forces modernisation since 2014 and to the right selection of equipment and munitions being provided by the Allies.

Expect a similar approach to Ukrainian offensives, a conservation of soldiers and munitions while being patient and targeting crucial enemy elements and a patience that will mean incremental advances.

Do not mistake this stage for stagnation. This hasn't been a stagnant war, it has been a defensive one. A misperception of 'stagnation' is an easy assessment to be caught up on, when what has actually happened is a tenacious defence.

Be patient, keep our pressure up on our reps in all our countries to give Ukraine the equipment and supplies it needs and we will be able to live to see the day Russia is forcefully deported from Ukrainian lands.

[Binkov's Battlegrounds](https://youtube.com/c/BinkovsBattlegrounds) was a channel that mostly covered theoretical conflicts, but has pivoted to mixing in some analysis of this war.

[Adam Something](https://youtube.com/c/AdamSomething) has done videos in the past, but has slowed down as the newsworthy events have slowed.

>2. Two of the large explosions happen simultaneously to the second. While this is not impossible to achieve with a missile strike, it is easier to achieve with explosive charges placed by SOF on the ground.

>3. @Maxar
 imagery from May shows that all four locations hit in the attack were used to store munitions for the strike aircraft. A smaller amount of explosives placed at these locations would be able to cause massive explosions.

Russia has lost on all geopolitical points, and is now on par with Iran for international pariah, this means getting critical components for industry, military and resource extraction are very hard.

As far as the war, they have bled themselves far too much for the ground they have gained and can't effectively mobilise which means in the coming months manpower strength is Ukraines.

Equipment wise the tide is turning towards Ukraine as Russia uses her forces in dumb ways and expends a lot of effort hitting civilian targets (which are a waste in time and munitions).

Ukraine effectively and coherently coordinates and conserves her forces, Russia does not on so many levels its embarrassing and is a large reason why she is in this situation.

This war will take time and for Ukraine is reliant on Allied supply. As long as this continues, Ukraine will slowly bleed Russia dry of soldiers and equipment and Russia will reach further into dated Soviet stocks.

The tide has turned, how long it takes to effectively swing back is in question but Russia is struggling to mount ANY offensive operations, whereas Ukraine is slowly beginning to do so.

Projecting forward, Russia's position worsens, Ukraine's is getting marginally better.

Russia has lost by many metrics that aren't directly related to terrain control, that control is beginning to be lost as well.

Russia has made the classic mistake of overestimating its strength relative to Ukraine, and that sort of mistake will likely make the next 20 years a painful time for it.

Without any collapse of the Russian military (which is unlikely at best) the war will continue for a long time, beyond this year and perhaps the next. As Ukraine begins to regain more territory, its will to return to pre-2014 lines grows, and Russia's stubbornness will get worse.

And Russia cannot reasonably change the outcome without mobilisation, and it likely can't do this effectively as it doesn't have the ability to train, command, supply or the political capital to do so.

Be careful of biases in all media sources, many western outlets use too much hyperbole, but from what I read, most SEA and middle-Asian outlets do worse. The mistake of all of them is ascribing far too much validity to Russian statements and news, which are entirely authoritarian and propaganda, that means facts are there but in very short supply and always twisted.

If you read 'Russia anything says' just assume it is a lie, you will be correct 95/100 times.

Ukraine focuses on burning Russian resources, while Russia is doing anything to ensure Ukraine has no morale (while in reality it has opposite effect).

I have a feeling that Russia has a great weakness in this war despite setting up the great trench defenses in form of Putins ego.

100,000 troops need food, water, ammunition, medical supplies, spare parts and equipment, and everything else required to make them effective.

Meaning they'd need to rely on Russia for all of that. Somehow integrating Russia's already strained logistic networks with NK's needs would be daunting.

But beyond that, as far as I'm aware Russia and North Korea have never conducted joint combat exercises, are not trained on each other's systems. They don't speak the same language. 

It's possible that Russia would want to get its hands on some of North Korea's artillery or short-range ballistic missile systems to try to respond to HIMARS. Though whether Pyongyang would part with their arsenal is another question (or whether they would permit the US and its allies the chance to observe them in action).

Except they can't. Not unless they want to see the return of ANOTHER Russian classic in the form of the Fall of 1917.

A few months ago needed to vacate my bowls while at work.  Someone had added pink boxes to the stall. Because something changed, and probably because it was pink, i checked to see if i had stepped into the wrong bathroom. Correct bathroom.  While doing my business i figured out that this pink box was a tampon dispenser.  I do not think of myself as trans-phobic.  It just had never occured to me that men using the men's room might be menstruating.  I do not know if NATO bases have tampon dispensers in the mens rooms.  Just a guess, but it strikes me as unlikely that Ukraine's military installed tampon dispensers in the men's rooms in new military bases in Ukraine during a war.  

If people on this forum start attacking a trans-rights group because the group complained about a lack of tampon dispensers or a lack of tampon supplies i would 1) assume that Ukraine probably really does not install dispensers on bases and 2) the idea that trans-rights groups are supporting Putin is ridiculous and 3) suppression of trans-rights groups is in itself a problem.   

The mob scrambling to bash Amnesty is the only reason anyone is suspicious of Ukraine's human rights record.  Shouting ""Fuck Amnesty! Fuck Human Rights Groups!"" is not a good public relations approach.  Ukraine should just agree with Amnesty and request that NATO provide funding and materials for construction of new NATO bases.

This is the point.This was why the English put Protestant Northern English and Scots into Ireland in the 1600s (the ""Plantation System"" from Lord Grey--Spenser the great English poet was secretary to Grey) to create the Scotch-Irish, who then came over to the US in the late 1600s through 1800s to ""resettle"" Appalachia and Georgia and moved out the Cherokee and the 5 Civilized Tribes. After the Cherokee and the 5 Civilized Tribes were ""removed"", how many of the Anglo/Scotch Irish in Tennessee and Georgia (to give two examples off the top of my family's head) would ""vote"" for Andy Jackson and the Trail of Tears?  Answer is almost all (some of the Cherokee did go into hiding are still in Georgia/Tennessee, a few).

I grew up in Oklahoma and went to to High School with some of the descendants of the Arapaho (and Osage).  Guess how many would ""vote"" to reclaim their territory, if that were on the ballot? Guess what would be the vote of the whites who claimed and now live on their land?

I realize this is difficult comparison since even most Americ ans who claim to ""know history"" don't know anything about how russia is replicating exactly what tactics were used in the US to dispossess the Native Americans.  Oklahoma (Indian Territory where the 5 Civilized Tribes were ""resettled"" when they were removed from the Southeast US, and then other tribes joined them) finally was allowed to become a state after it was carved up to whites and whites had a clear majority.

I'm giving Putin too much credit to claim he studies US history and the dispossession of the Native-Americans but it sure seems like it. To most Americans this is, meh! They didn't grow up with the descendents of those on the Trail of Tears nor do they know anything about American history in regards to exactly the tactics Putin is using.

And Putin is a monster.

Rant over.  If you fall into the trap of ""well how would Crimean residents vote right now"", you fall into the trap of presentism and Putin.  If I killed  or moved everyone in Nevada and moved in my friends and held an election, who do you think might ""win"" this election? This is why Putin is now talking about having an online referendum in the Ukraine territories they just pounded into sand by artillery, herded all the residents, queried them about whether they supported Russia or Ukraine, and for the latter either killed them or deported them and their children. That's your ""election""--whoever is left after the invasion.  Russia hasn't much time to move in Russians other than the held territories in the Donbass, Crimea and elsewhere in the East after 2014 when they invaded Crimea.

""Elections"" indeed. This is why Zhelensky is talking about reconquest of Kherson and elsewhere, even if it does not happen soon. Russia will hold their fake ""elections"" and claim suzerainty over Ukraine, those areas where they invaded now (earlier in the original invasion they would have taken control of Kiev and rigged an entire ""election"" that they claimed was the whole country) . That is going to happen in a month, if Ukraine doesn't reclaim the territory.

Excuse me?!  I'm British you absolute bell end.

In any event: I don't think 99% of Russia ""is wholly innocent"", I just also don't think you can hold them all guilty for the actions of a government over whom they have little control or those of a relatively small number of soldiers who are mostly forced into Ukraine against their will.

That's like holding all Brits responsible for Bloody Sunday, all Americans responsible for Guantanamo Bay, or all Dutch people responsible for Srebrenica.  In fact, it's worse, because in those democracies the public actually have some semblance of control over their governments; whereas in Russia any attempt to exercise such puts you in grave danger.

I'm the last person to make any apology for Russia's absolutely atrocious genocide in Ukraine, as would be plainly obvious from my comment history.  But trying to blame 140 million people for that atrocity when very very few of that vast number are either involved or have any sway is also appalling.

Of course we should hold the soldiers, the commanders, the politicians and the propagandists accountable for their actions.  Of course we should hold to account the extreme nationalists who are vociferously supporting this genocide.

They have to do anything to deplete the forward positioned infantry. Around Kherson proper Russian artillery can hit a large amount of the front from artillery staged on the other side of the river which means they don't have to move all those shells across. Ukraine doesn't have so many tanks that they will be able to exhaust the Russian infantry anti armor weapons. Bullets and food are light compared to the artillery logistics and every day they are moving more across. They were well aware of the HIMARs when they started building up the south. They had to assume the bridges would get taken out. Russia is still doing probing attacks in the south. 

A full collapse due to supply is pure speculation and wishful thinking by any current evidence. We have to assume that Ukrainians have not innovated anything to up end the basic principles governing attack and defence. It's still not clear if Ukraine still plans on attacking in the south, if they ever did or if the plan has changed due to the Russian build up. The poorly supplied and motivated Russians have not been as incompetent in defence as they they have been in attack.

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/11/1085427380/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-zaporizhzhia). This was not just Russia firing at the the plant for the fun of it like you guys are trying to convey. This was a fucking firefight.

Now when it comes to the renewed shelling, why would Russia shell their own troops stationed at the site? I’ll repeat that, why would the Russian military shell its own troops who are protecting a very important strategic asset?",False,1660257384.0,t3_wlht41,t1_ijwpghk,,8,-3,0,-3,0,0,

To the extent any horizontal velocity remains, it'll obviously impart horizontal force on the target rather than vertical so not necessarily the sort of damage that might have been under consideration and possibly just skidding along the ground.

Ukraine took its worst losses of the war in the Kharkiv region when they were fresher and had more experienced troops all while Russia was in a slow fighting retreat drawing forces for the Dombas offensive. You don't need combined arms in defense especially with the advent of drones/artillery organically finding their own targets and correcting their fire. The combined arms operations is a practiced discipline. On thing that tripped up western analysts on assessing Russia was observing them in Syria. They seemed fairly competent coordinating their forces but they couldn't scale that to a larger operation which is why they fell back to rolling artillery in front of ground forces. Communication and quality of troops just matters more, defending is significantly easier and less dynamic. Sit in your hole, watch this sector and shoot anything that moves. Ukraine did an exceptional job of this and their high motivation helped but they have taken significant losses and the newly trained troops are not as good, it takes time to get them up to speed and sync in the field.",False,1660247662.0,t3_wlht41,t1_ijvtzcc,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
