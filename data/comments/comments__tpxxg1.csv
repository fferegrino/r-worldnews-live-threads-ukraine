Day 32 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The day was mostly quiet, but there was a single bomber plane that dropped a bomb somewhere at around 3 am, we don’t know where exactly as now we are not even allowed to post the names of the streets that were damaged. We do know it was somewhere close to the center of the city but we don’t know the target.

Around 8 pm we also heard some of our artillery and incoming shelling, even heard just a single shot being fired from some gun. But the weirdest thing today was definitely the weather. We had rain at night, snowstorm during the day and extreme wind currents in the evening, it sounded like everything went flying outside, it was really loud. Not sure if it’s beneficial to us as our army is now going into counteroffensives around Kharkiv.

We continue to read posts and comments from Russians and what still makes us mad is just how crazy most of them are. Like how the hell can you believe that everything is alright and that we should stop getting mad at Russians? We tell them that there are fucking explosions just outside of our window and their response is “yeah alright, I get it, but what about the weather though?” 

They just can’t even fathom what a war really is. They look at it through the lens of movies, as if it was something trivial. The feeling of fear when a bomber is flying right above your home and you don’t know where it will drop the bomb is something you can’t even describe, you can’t “get it” unless you live through it, and I hope nobody else has to. But their sheer inability to even try to understand our situation just demotivates us from trying to explain anything for them.

[Actually something that Russian Deputy Finance Minister said just recently really showed us their true colors](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tpn5zw/russian_deputy_finance_minister_zhilova_russians/). The Ministry did say afterwards that she doesn’t represent their views, but personally knowing many Russians it is exactly how they think. Saying that Russians are the supreme race really doesn’t help their image of “denazifiers”. It also answers my question about why they don’t care about their country’s economy. If people like this control their economy then it is no wonder why they think they can survive being cut off from global market.

> 
> Abramovich, along with another Russian entrepreneur, had taken part in the negotiations alongside Ukraine’s MP Rustem Umerov. The negotiation round on the afternoon of 3 March took place on Ukrainian territory, and lasted until about 10 pm.

> Based on remote and on-site examinations, the experts concluded that the symptoms are most likely the result of intentional poisoning with an undefined chemical weapon.

Updates:

> An alternative less likely hypothesis was use of microwave irradiation. The symptoms gradually subsided in the course of the following week.

> The three men experiencing the symptoms consumed only chocolate and water in the hours before the symptoms appeared. A fourth member of the team who also consumed these did not experience symptoms.

> According to two consulted CW experts and a doctor, the symptoms were most consistent with variants of porphyrin, organophosphates, or bicyclic substances. A definitive determination was not possible due to the absence of specialized laboratory equipment near the victims.

> The experts said the dosage and type of toxin used was likely insufficient to cause life-threatening damage, and most likely was intended to scare the victims as opposed to cause permanent damage. The victims said they were not aware of who might have had an interest in an attack.

> Bellingcat chose not to report this story earlier due to concern about the safety of the victims. Given the choice of the targeted individuals to speak up, Bellingcat and its investigative partner @the_ins_ru  intend to publish an investigation into the presumed poisonings.

Choice quotes:

> The russians looted [the town's small cafe], took everything – electric appliances, cut up the sofas, smashed the plasma TV. Then they went to the school building. They even cut a stretched ceiling in the school. They behaved like barbarians,” Nadiya said.

> One of the village residents says she survived the German occupation during WWII. Our correspondent asked her if it is true that even Germans did not behave like that during the war. “I was 12 during the war. **The Germans did terrible things too but they did not take anything. They didn’t ransack our homes like that,” she replied.**",1648474150.0,1648473461.0,t3_tpxxg1,t3_tpxxg1,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

a day that people are fatigued by this war, but the last 48 hours have been very promising from a Ukrainian perspective. Consider the following in chronological order:

* Staggered withdrawal of Russian forces from the northern areas of Ukraine;
* Mariupol, once predicted to fall within 48-72 hours a week ago, is still holding off the Russians;
* There's been less activity in the Black Sea and attempts to try and break through to Odessa has been repelled;
* Further to the Odessa problem, Russian forces have lost control in the Kherson Oblast, leaving it wide open for Ukrainian forces to try and take back the Oblast and further bisect Russia's southern front;
* The retaking of multiple villages and small cities, including full control over Sumy, east of Kyiv has allowed Ukraine to almost completely kill any chance of Russia being able to set up logistical columns;
* A reattempt by Russia to try and attack the eastern section of Kyiv is ongoing, despite attempts to withdraw, but it is expected to fail.

Yes, Ukraine has experienced losses, and their suffering in Mariupol is tragic and horrific. But these updates in the last 48 hours suggest that maybe the tide is turning significantly in Ukraine's favour. Their morale remains high, they are well-equipped, supplied, and supported by NATO intelligence. 

This coming week will be very interesting from a micro-update perspective because as the war drags on, updates will be less frequent, but even the smallest detail seems to be exceptionally favourable to Ukraine.

----

**KARA-MURZA**: … If you look and analyze what Putin's propaganda has been doing, I think they’ve long stopped pretending that this regime is so good and great and beneficial for the Russian people. Their message is that, first of all, all the others are even worse; and secondly, that everybody does it [election rigging] across the world, too, and that there's **no such thing** as **real democracy**. There's no such thing as **genuine media freedom**. There's no such thing as **real elections**, and **everywhere is manipulated**. 

If it were possible to create doubts and to create chaos with the political system of a major Western democratic country like the U.S., I think that will certainly serve the propaganda goals of Vladimir Putin's regime. This may indeed be another aspect of this. If you look at the coverage in Kremlin-controlled media of elections, not just the U.S. election of 2016 but also other elections [on or before Oct 2017 when recorded - ed.]—the recent French election, the upcoming elections in Germany—that has been the message; that yeah, everywhere is like this. Everywhere there's administrative resource; everywhere there's no real media freedom; and everywhere the elections are manipulated and controlled and achieve the result of the current whoever’s in government wants. 

I'm stating the **completely obvious** here, but needless to say, that flies in the face of the facts just beginning with the simple **fact** that so many people who have been in power **have actually lost elections** in Western countries.

**This has never yet happened in Russia. Just think about this.** Throughout the whole of the history of Russia, there has never been a ruler who has lost an election, at least lost an election to an extent that he then lost power. Boris Yeltsin, when he was president, he lost a lot of parliamentary elections, so he had actually an opposition majority in parliament for the duration of his presidency. The parliament was a real thing in Yeltsin's Russia, unlike today. But he still stayed in power. 

**There was not a single election in Russian history when the ruler, the incumbent, lost power as the result of an election. Just think about this.**

edit: He also notes, since 2004 **exactly one** (non-systemic)^[a] person has won a parliament-level or higher election at all: **[Boris Nemestov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov).**

Red Forest:  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Forest  
  
The Red Forest (Ukrainian: Рудий ліс, Rudyi lis, Russian: Рыжий лес, Ryzhy les, literally ""ginger-color forest"") is the 10-square-kilometer (4 sq mi) area surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant within the Exclusion Zone located in Polesia. The name ""Red Forest"" comes from the ginger-brown color of the pine trees after they died following the absorption of high levels of radiation from the Chernobyl accident on 26 April 1986.[1] In the post-disaster cleanup operations, the Red Forest was bulldozed and buried in ""waste graveyards"".[2] The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world today.[3]

It would be like Japan bombing Pearl Harbour hoping it demoralizes the enemy.  Instead, all those pacifists and cowards who were working in your favour suddenly become you enemies.

**""The first casualty, when war comes, is truth"" - Various**

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later. As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.


**In Ukraine**

👉🆕 Residents in Kherson report that they are hearing explosions from outside the city

👉🆕 The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) claims it has ""liquidated"" five Russian botfarms with over 100 000 social media accounts since the start of the war, according to spokesman Artem Dehtyarenko.

**Other notable events**

👉🆕 Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was allegedly poisoned during the peace talks on the night to March 4 and apparently lost his sight for several hours according to a journalist with The Guardian and the investigative journalist group Bellingcat. He was then treated in Turkey, which might explain his absence during later negotiations.

👉🆕 A document alleged to be from the Russian Defence Ministry, and signed by ""temporary Minister of Defence"" Bulgakov rather than Shoigu, was released by Anonymous. The document is purported to detail orders to create media documenting the bad treatment of Russian PoWs. While this could certainly be something Russia has done or plans to do, there's many on social media claiming it's a fake and that Bulgakov's signature on the document doesn't compare well to other examples of his signature. There'll no doubt be experts analyzing it should it be taken seriously

Michael koffman has been very accurate in his predictions so far. He was born in Ukraine but is (somehow cause I couldn’t be) fairly unbiased. Last week he talked about how Russia can and probably will sustain a large war for longer than most think since, sanctions will take many months to really start hurting Russia deeply and how they can find manpower if they need to. He has spent past episodes taking about how the Ukraine forces have run circles around Russia strategically and played it really well. And he followed it up last week by talking about taking the offensive is much harder and how Ukraine is at a disadvantage in a war of attrition. He hasn’t taken sides (okay he’s rooting for Ukraine, but we all are) in his discussions. I find it refreshing as someone who studied military history every day for fun. 

This will not be everyone’s cup of tea. Some people aren’t interested in aspects of war like rail lines. Or don’t want a fairly unbiased viewpoint.

[This interesting tidbit just got posted.](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1508169527976247307)

I bet you that Putin needs a victory before sanctions bite, and he is going for a decisive, knockout blow type battle. He probably believes that he needs to win NOW before the west can pump more equipment into Ukraine and his army runs out of equipment. Furthermore, Putin seems like the type who needs to know. He can't negotiate unless he is sure he is victorious or totally defeated. Otherwise it would eat at him, he would consider it weakness to take the deals Zelenskyy has offered. He needs to either beat Ukraine, or force Ukraine to beat him. 

This is a really stupid, incredibly risky idea when you have a poorly led army of demoralized soldiers who have become used to getting their asses kicked. In fact, if Ukraine wins, we very likely see a total collapse of the entire Russian invasion. 

I think we are going to see both sides pour everything they can spare into the Donbas over the next few weeks and Russia will attempt to secure a miracle victory by throwing every they can spare for a great battle at Izium and along that whole Ukrainian front in the Donbas. The decisive battle of the war may be coming soon.

Monday, March 28, 2022 05:55 PM 
By Birgit Jennen and Carolynn Look

Companies must reject ‘any kind of blackmail,’ Lindner says

German finance minister comments in Bloomberg TV interview

(Bloomberg) --German companies must resist Russia’s demands for gas payments to be made in rubles, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said.

“We can’t accept any kind of blackmail,” he told Bloomberg Television in an interview on Monday. “The treaties are based on dollars and euros” and “we suggest private-sector companies to stick to these currencies.”

German Finance Minister Christian Lindner says his country won’t pay for Russian gas in rubles.
The comments by the finance chief of Europe’s largest economy come after Russian President Vladimir Putin last week ordered his country’s central bank to develop a mechanism to force ruble payments for natural gas from “hostile states.” Such a move would essentially force European companies to prop up his currency after it was sent into free-fall by sanctions that followed the invasion of Ukraine.

“Putin has to decide to accept or not to accept -- in any case we are prepared and we will find solutions,” Lindner said. “It is our long-term objective to be less dependent on Russian imports.”

There are simply no words.

Mariupol mayor calls for ""complete evacuation"" of the city

The mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol said Monday his city was ""in the hands of the occupiers"" after a weekslong siege by Russian forces that flattened the city, left an unknown number of civilians dead and forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. 

""Not everything is in our power,"" said Vadym Boichenko, the pro-government mayor of Mariupol, in a live television interview. ""Unfortunately, we are in the hands of hands of the occupiers today.""

Boichenko called for a complete evacuation of the remaining population of Mariupol, which had a population of over 400,000 before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 

""According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today, where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,"" he said. ""And it's really scary.""

""I don’t know if there is a line. At best it would be directly attacking the United States, for real, not some Article 5 thing about Montenegro or Croatia or whoever, and even then I’m not sure if it’s worth it. Those are America’s missiles, everyone else just borrows them.

The costs of this are just so high that the way we normally think about war doesn’t work anymore. A large conventional war would be nowhere near as awful for humanity as even a moderate nuclear war. There would be no safe place for civilians to go, it would necessarily kill a ton of people who were just going about their lives, and the damage wouldn’t stop as soon as the guns fell silent or even years after the fact.

We may have to accept Russia running most of Europe if the only alternative is millions of innocent people dying so America can make a political point. We essentially did, even under the hawkiest Presidents, by allowing the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc to exist for as long as they did.

If we hate Putin for killing a thousand or so civilians, how much worse would we be doing that to, not kidding, millions of people, almost all of whom are not military or on military targets.""

So your line is a direct attack on America?  Screw every ally and everyone that has helped America over the years.  Piss on literally every other country.  

We may have to ""accept Russia running most of Europe""?  I don't think you understand how the world works.  If Russia runs most of Europe there is no America.  Millions of Americans would die from the economic collapse.

I appreciate you taking the time to reply and explain your position, but frankly your view of the world is so naive that I can't take it seriously.  I also cannot respect your position here.  The world doesn't work like you think.  It is all interconnected.  America is what America is because it lead the largest economic block.  If you change the balance of power the way you want to you won't have most of your drugs, your technology, your clothes or your food.  You are arguing to act as an isolationist because you have an unrealistic risk assessment of nuclear war breaking out.  

Isolationist countries DO NOT thrive.  They do not succeed.  Your approach is literally the worst possible stance for any responsible modern country to take.

Again, I appreciate you actually stating your position, but, with respect I think you may want to think on it a bit.

They get to an area, use their super speed and manuevers to destroy a plane is fast as possible, and then leave. It is a a light fighter like the F-16, but more specialized in interception.

I mean, what with their day-to-weekly reminders, etc.  But, with trying to sabotage peace talks by poisoning included on top of their war crimes committed in Ukraine — what is the line, where is the decency, when is “never again” truly a statement reflecting duty and not just a minimal action?

The U.S., our Western allies including our global partners without doubt have supplied Ukraine with resources both lethal and humanitarian in nature, and have been lockstep with each other since before and after Russia invaded. As rhetoric and military escalation continues in both Ukraine, Eastern European nations and elsewhere in the Euro area, I have but one question — one I find important to ponder. 

Why should the West effectively be held hostage by their (Russia’s) insistence on waging war, conquering militarily; all while saying that any intervention to stop war crimes is an action that would warrant a nuclear exchange, (MAD)?

Hoping for some responses other than “Russia wouldn’t attack NATO territory” or “Russia wouldn’t launch nukes, even one in Ukraine… cause that would lead to ‘MAD’….”

But I’m honestly curious what the action is — Ukrainians being sent to Russian camps, poisoning officials, crimes of war and aggression? Also, NATO is a defensive treaty, this is known, but while countries are shocked, yet more resources, tools and weapons flow into Ukraine by allies, and although Russia has been dealt the economic equal of an thermonuclear bomb… their means of rhetoric and war continue to double down in spite of mounting losses. 

And as we’ve seen, Russia since has resorted to targeting civilian populations, food storage and supply centers and increasing use cluster bombs and thermobaric ordinance. 

So, with sincerity, what’s the line? If it’s simply waiting for Russia to cross into NATO territory than it’s going to be a dark time ahead — not only as Ukraine’s fight for freedom continues in the face of Russian aggression, but also with a worsening food crisis threatening global shortages, too.

In a way, the means to ending the war might not be solely through crimes of aggression against Ukraine; rather that of global disruptions stemming from the pandemic, which (food shortages, supply chain, etc.) Putin exacerbated in his illogical, deludedly paranoid gambit to invade Ukraine.

The broad strokes of peace are already there. Zelensky has pledged not to join NATO and is giving up Crimea (one step to formally recognizing the territory as russian). 

If there was peace, Russia would achieve the primary aims of neutrality like in Austria, and the recognition of Crimea. The donbas region and the currently held territory are of secondary importance and are likely bargaining chips to be used in nailing down the details of the deal. For example, since Zelensky is planning on calling a referendum on any peace deal, it is unlikely that Russia has a full withdrawal until the referendum has passed.

> Q: Assuming this war isn't just about Russia and Ukraine, from the historical perspective - what make this conflict different than all of the other proxy wars between Russia and USA/NATO?

----

**PROXY WARS**

This is certainly reminiscent of the horrible bipolar game of thrones that has been played [again and again and again and again and again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars). It's the same two marionette puppeteers, playing almost the same game, over and over again. And both sides used these proxy wars to wage an economic warfare on each other - while at the same time having other people do the actual warfare. Many historians agree that this kind of economic warfare lead to the demise of the USSR. So while the puppetmasters pay for these wars in money and sometimes a little spilled blood, usually they find a way for others (almost always non-nuclear states) to pay - in buckets. And this whole process takes place with the twisted umbrella shield of MAD. And until recently it was **only** this nuclear superweapon which shields these puppet masters from escalating into total world wars. But could there be another superweapon lurking? The demise of the USSR smashed the lives of millions of people, but from those broken shards a select few saw a lucrative new opportunity hiding underneath Russian soil. And from this soil emerged a new, insidious superweapon...

**THE KGB, FSB, GRU, and ACTIVE MEASURES**

It's been long understood that the deeply kleptocratic Russia attacks the west using influence, bribery, corruption, blackmail, espionage, and murder - all of these tactics operating in the darkness. These attacks are enabled by corruption in the west, sure -- but they are **catalyzed** by the very nature of the system of the west. The openness, the cooperation, the democracy, the alliances, the free media, the free elections. **Russia attacks them all.** They are unyielding and unceasing in their efforts. They are using the properties we in the west hold as virtues - turning them on their head, and exploiting them. They bribe and corrupt. They capture and compromise. They hack and steal. They kill, poison, and assassinate. They wage unyielding information warfare on us relentlessly, again using our technology - the internet and open media - against us. 

**ACTIVE MEASURES**

And they have repeatedly sought to disrupt, influence, and rig elections. **But this last time, they went further.** They had been poking around trying to influence elections all over the world for decades. They have been doing it to US elections for decades. The US snoops too. But this time, the Russians took it one step further. They sought to disrupt and rig elections of one of the puppet masters. They attacked from a dozen different angles. They succeeded. They played on many of the west's weaknesses all in concert. And they succeeded in their attack. But they don't have the same weaknesses to attack. After all, nobody in Russia gets elected at all. [Nobody has even ever lost power due to losing an election.](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tpxxg1/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i2ehc3r/) Only one person has ever **won** an election at all at a national level since Putin took power: [Boris Nemtsov](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tpxxg1/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i2ehc3r/). And he was gunned down in the street. It was this among many other heinous acts which convinced the US and the west in general to keep the pressure on using the [Magnitsky Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act). (in fact, US Sen. McCain was one of the core reasons this act remained in effect, and he hand picked the above person and mentee of Boris Nemtsov to be McCain's pallbearer).

**THE RUSSIAN UNDERBELLY**

In the last decade, however, the west has noticed that this murky underworld of Russia has weaknesses too. Even with this massive military - we can't just invade, the nuclear weapons shield prevents that. We can't really compete in terms of corruption; we have corruption of our own but we can't influence their spies as effectively as their spies can influence our everything. So the west doesn't really have a handle on which to grab, to put pressure on or indeed retaliate for their transgressions. The core weakness is that - while the system of corruption makes these oligarchs incredibly rich, **they don't keep or reinvest that money into Russia**. After all, they know how it works. They understand the fragility of the system. They want to buy goods and services that Russia can not offer. They want to live like kings, in London and Geneva and on islands. They convert their money to Euros, into yachts, into dollars.

**A NEW SUPERWEAPON**

A new superweapon was discovered: sanctions. Because there's so much money stolen from the Russians, and because it's stored all over the world... you can simply freeze/cut it off. You can target these economic effects directly to the people and corporations involved with the activity, or make them more broad. But crucially, you can *really* put pressure on this huge kleptocratic class.

The bottom line is, there is now a weapon with which one the puppetmasters can directly attack the other, after decades of asymmetric warfare from the Russians operating in the dark against the open west. And this weapon has been used to greater and greater effect. And it's, again, **catalyzed** by the kleptocratic corruption of the Russian oligarchs and enabled by the self-interest of those oligarchs to further integrate into the world economy.

**SUMMARY**

That is what is fundamentally different about this war compared to the previous proxy wars. It's not that it's Ukraine, or that that Ukraine borders Russia. It's not NATO or the EU or the righteous belief in European democracies. It **is** about Ukraine's right to decide its own alliances, free from all of this dark corruption. It's not a battle of good versus evil in Ukraine vs Russia. Ukraine is a democracy, it may one day be filled with baddies. But they have a right to be a democracy, and they have a right to choose how they operate. But this is bigger than Ukraine. It's a the culmination of decades of struggle between a meanderingly corrupt democratic system versus a ravenously corrupt kleptocratic system. And one side discovered they had a new weapon. But like any superweapon, it is hard to predict the ramifications of its use. Will it backfire? Will the financial fallout be survivable?",False,1648495924.0,t3_tpxxg1,t3_tpxxg1,,0,0,0,0,0,0,

We, Ukrainian and foreign journalists, as well as media organizations and NGOs, demand that all measures be taken immediately to end the harassment of journalists who are Ukraine's greatest allies in this war. We also demand to involve qualified technical specialists and to develop transparent rules for the coverage of Russian shelling.

The contribution of journalists is extremely valuable for Ukraine. It is through their work that the world and the citizens of Ukraine learn about Russia's crimes, about the humanitarian catastrophe they caused, and about the destruction and victims of the Russian shelling. It is thanks to the free and unhindered work of foreign journalists that the world now supports Ukraine. Instead, the Russian dictatorship is making every effort to exterminate independent journalists and newsrooms.

Due to systematic unsubstantiated statements by officials and official structures, the society began to see betrayal and ""adjustment of fire"" in the work of all journalists without exception, which is extremely harmful for Ukraine.

We call for immediate resolution of key issues which are necessary to improve the situation with the work of journalists in Ukraine.

1. Settle the issue of accreditation of journalists from the Ministry of Defense. Explain to the Territorial Defense Units and the Security Service of Ukraine on the ground what this accreditation means. If journalists are required to provide additional documents to confirm the MoD's accreditation, indicate what these documents should be in order to remove questions to journalists.

2. Stop the practice of ""manual mode"" of journalists' access to filming locations. Army generals must solve combat tasks, not spend their precious time on micromanagement of film crews on the ground.

3. Involve technical specialists and finally resolve the issue of coverage of artillery and missile shelling and places of destruction. Allow journalists to work on the spot immediately after the shelling, but, if necessary, impose an embargo on the publication of information after the shelling. The decision to not cover the shelling should be reasoned by experts and transparent.

4. Settle issues related to the coverage of humanitarian aid distribution points, bomb shelters, the life of peaceful cities, etc. We remind you that information about these places is publicly available, and on the contrary, the authorities and activists ask the media to disseminate it to inform citizens.

5. Provide all possible assistance to the work of Ukrainian journalists, on a par with foreign media, and end ""double standards"" in relation to foreign and Ukrainian journalists.

We call on the parties to engage in dialogue and build transparent rules for the work of journalists in Ukraine. In order for Ukraine to win, it is very important to build the most favorable conditions for the work of a free press, as much as possible in conditions of war.

The Donbass is going to continue to be a thorn in Ukraines side and those two breakaway republics are ultra pro Russia anyway. The same goes with Crimea they are vastly more pro Russia then the rest of Ukraine.

Why try and hold on to two small breakaway republics in the Donbas when they are armed and supported by the Kremlin? It would be easier to let them become part of Russia if that’s what they really want.

The rest of Ukraine is Pro West and will rebuild and probably become very prosperous especially with EU integration.

They also complain that there is a lot of rusophobia nowadays and they do not understand why, we are all people and should love each other... I mean... REALLY?

""Since then, transliterations in English have moved closer to Ukrainian. In 2006, the United States Board on Geographic Names, a federal body that standardizes geographic names, adopted “Kyiv” as the preferred spelling. In 2019, the board retired “Kiev” as an alternative""
  
""The changed city names go beyond Kyiv. During Soviet times, some major city names ended with the possessive “ov.” Those names now end with “iv,” which stems from a linguistic difference between Russian and Ukrainian that originated in the 12th century, says Dr. Flier. For instance, Lviv in the west and Kharkiv in the east of the country were referred to as Lvov and Kharkov""

 >Igor Domnikov was well known in Novaya Gazeta among his colleagues for his witty essays and acerbic tone. He was attacked on his way to his Moscow apartment, near the doorway, on 12 May 2000. Hit with a hard object, presumably a hammer by an unknown assailant, he was lying unconscious in a pool of his own blood when found by a neighbor; Igor Domnikov was delivered to a hospital with skull and brain injuries, underwent surgery, but remained in a coma. He died from the injuries on 16 July 2000.

His literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language  though it is different from the language of his poems. Shevchenko is also known for his many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.

Optics are overkill, prone to breakage, harder to use, heavier and more expensive. Optics become a burden if you have to crawl in mud and bounce in obstacles but don't have time to maintain your gun.

Anyways, automatic weapons are used primarily to keep heads down while spamming short bursts in enemy direction. Their effectiveness comes more from fear than making every bullet to count. Snipers are added in the mixture for that purpose and artillery takes the job of erasing the enemy from the area. Battle capability of an unit is gone way earlier than every man is dead or wounded due to physical and mental stress, lack of supplies and food, or sleep deprivation and loss of motivation.

It is estimated that in WW2 45000 bullets were used for one kill. That was prior to time when automatic weapons became a standard for an infantry man.

This is often several hundred feet for most modern weapons. So, if you've got a target the size of a dinner plate that's 200 yards away (600 feet) it's trivial to hit.

Beyond that range the bullets are falling thus you need to aim higher. Iron sights allow you to make an adjustment that will force you to raise the barrel to aim at the target.

So I imagine this is pressing the Russians to hasten their retreat. Because if the Ukrainians pull that off, then the whole retreat either has to stop so the Russians can break the Ukrainian lines and extract their troops, _or_ the Russians cut their losses and leave them to fight out on their own. 

And without access to their already meager supply lines, those 10,000 Russians will _not_ last long. They either surrender, or there’s a bloodbath as the Ukrainians go for the kill. And I mean that for soldiers and civilians, because the Ukrainians will probably beat the Russian camps like a drum with their artillery. And the Russian soldiers will likely pillage and murder any remaining civilians in the circle to keep themselves fed and warm if they decide to dig in. If they go for a mass fighting retreat, I expect that would be chaotic, bloody and destructive as well. 

Realistically, some mixture of all four scenarios is gonna take place. And if the Ukrainians do complete the encirclement _and_ successfully take those Russian assets off the board, it’s gonna be a huge loss for the Russian army regardless of how the killing blow is delivered. The morale boost to the Ukrainians would be insane, and vice versa for the Russians. And then the Ukrainians can press the advantage or redeploy some forces to other besieged cities. 

I’m speculating of course. God knows what’s gonna happen until it actually does, and even short of another 10,000 or so men, the Russians still have the numerical and material edge by a large margin. But a major Ukrainian victory here could be a turning point in the war. It would help deter Belarusian entrance to the war, and the PR boost to Ukraine would drive more volunteers and war aid to their side. Russian anti-war sentiment could grow further, and Putin’s political clout at home would be weakened a lot more. Ukraine would have a major boost to their negotiating hand in peace talks, especially if they take a shit ton of neo-Soviet POWs. Doubly so if a reallocation of troops is used to break the siege on Mariupol. On the flip side, with the Russians claiming they’re going  to redeploy most forces to the Donbas and focus there, Ukraine relieving Mariupol might only embolden the reds because they need something to show for this war, and the land bridge to Crimea is the main prize here for them. Ukraine can’t afford to lose access to the Sea of Azov on the other hand either.

> ""If you take the five worst presidents in American history and put them together, [it turns out that] they all did not do the damage that Joe Biden did in just 15 months. In a little over a year, he managed to literally kill the American dream,"" he said. Trump, speaking on Saturday at a rally of his supporters in the city of Commerce (Georgia).
> 
> The ex-president also expressed the opinion that the situation in Ukraine would not have developed in the way it is now if he had headed the United States, and the Russian special operation could have been avoided.
> 
> Trump believes that the United States currently has problems with NATO, because they ""do not trust the American representation.""
> 
> In addition, according to the former head of the White House, Chinese President Xi Jinping also cannot help but notice the weakness of the current American authorities. ""Taiwan will be next because he (the Chinese leader - TASS note) sees what is happening, he sees our weak leadership,"" said Trump, who previously argued that the Republican Party would regain power in the United States following the presidential election in 2024.

As simply as I can make it..

There are fundamentally two types of military personnel: Officers and Soldiers (or ""Enlisted"", in US parlance). Officers organise and issue orders, soldiers execute those plans. 

Officer ranks are (broadly, starting from bottom) Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Colonel, Brigadier, General. 

Soldier ranks are (again, simplifying massively and going bottom to top) Private, Corporal, Sergeant, Warrant Officer. 

Things like ""Sergeant Major"" and ""Commander"" are jobs or roles performed by people of a specific rank, but not a rank itself.

This is for Army (land based). The names are different in Air Force and Navy contexts, but the idea of an officer class and a soldier class is maintained.

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

 

The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

A Russian defeat will make possible a “new birth of freedom,” and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.

Additionally, one of Russia's few strategic victories was destroying the dams that blocked Crimea off from fresh water supplies so they'll be able to hold out for quite a while.

Sadistic means he takes pleasure from causing pain.

Narcissist means the only thing that matters to him is him.

Just liberations of small villages on the north side of the river.

Anyway this is the Plan C of the invasion - take Donbass as the consolation prize. That's why they're pulling away from Kyiv. It's no longer a feasible objective

***1. What will happen to Ukraine after the war?***

A lot of it depends on how well Zelenskyy maintains his relationships with international partners and how he can leverage his popularity with EU population. If he does this successfully, he'll get a lot of rebuilding dollars.

BUT economically the largest destruction is in the East, and that was where more of the heavy industry was. So any recovery will likely be leveraging Ukraine's agricultural potential or mining in the South and West. Exporting such stuffs needs a good port, and Mariupol had facilitated this pre war IIRC. So they'll need to get some sort of export avenue set up.

And all of that depends on what terrain and cities Ukraine holds onto and in what state.

***2. Ukrainian corruption***

This is a hard one to predict. It depends on Zelenskyy and those who are loyal to him and how effective they are at processes and checks and balances. He has a LOT of power now, either due to wartime footing or political capital (his popularity). If he can leverage both, corruption may end up being in decline, but it will take time. Corruption is like culture, very hard to fix quickly and the trick is doing it from the ground up.

***3. Military spending and post-war military***

This is relatively easy to predict. Ukraine will maintain a large military and will look to EU and NATO exporters (UK, France, US) for equipment. And they will look to completely overhaul their materiel to focus on Western-supplied stuff. That way if Russia ever invades again, they can easily resupply.

This is probably the lasting legacy of this war, Ukraine has seen that Allied tactics and training works, allied equipment works. They will want to make the full transition ASAP.

Key areas to watch are Planes, IFVs and Tanks. If they want bang-for-buck, maybe IFVs, planes and support systems (AA and Artillery platforms) and Tanks last, as tanks are expensive to maintain but you can get decent combat effect with good IFVs and Artillery. Also IFVs and Artillery work with how they've fought this war, synergising with big Light Infantry elements.

Planes will be the big one though, and the most expensive.

How they approach their logistics, supply and maintenance will be key to how good their military becomes.

Uh, no. It's WAY more complicated than that.

The oil embargo didn't cause the Japanese to attack.  Why on Earth would a supplier STOP THE EMBARGO because you attacked???  Why would America end the oil embargo after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor???

The oil embargo led the Japanese to plan attacks to control oil rich Dutch East Indies. The Japanese presumed the Americans would try to stop them. So they planned attacks on the Philippines but believed the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor would try to stop them there.  So they thought attacking Hawaii would cripple the U.S.  

In short, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor because they thought the U.S. would go to war over the Dutch East Indies.  They preemptively attacked.

In hindsight, the Japanese were better off attacking the Dutch East Indies but then working with the Germans to try to stoke isolationist public sentiment in the U.S.  Much of America didn't have an appetite to fight other people's wars back then.

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

 

The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

A Russian defeat will make possible a “new birth of freedom,” and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.

----

**PROXY WARS**

This is a horrible bipolar game of thrones that has been played [again and again and again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proxy_wars). It's the same two marionette puppeteers, playing almost the same game, over and over again. And both sides used these proxy wars to wage an economic warfare on each other - while at the same time having other people do the actual warfare. Many historians agree that this kind of economic warfare lead to the demise of the USSR. So while the puppetmasters pay for these wars in money and sometimes a little spilled blood, usually they find a way for others (almost always non-nuclear states) to pay - in buckets. And this whole process takes place with the twisted umbrella shield of MAD. And until recently it was **only** (and still is) this nuclear superweapon which shields these puppet masters from escalating into total world wars. But could there be another superweapon lurking? The demise of the USSR smashed the lives of millions of people, but from those broken shards a select few saw a lucrative new opportunity hiding underneath Russian soil.

**THE KGB, FSB, GRU, and ACTIVE MEASURES**

It's been long understood that the deeply kleptocratic Russia attacks the west using influence, bribery, corruption, blackmail, espionage, and murder - all of these tactics operating in the darkness. These attacks are enabled by corruption in the west, sure -- but they are **catalyzed** by the very nature of the system of the west. The openness, the cooperation, the democracy, the alliances, the free media, the free elections. **Russia attacks them all.** They are unyielding and unceasing in their efforts. They are using the properties we in the west hold as virtues - turning them on their head, and exploiting them. They bribe and corrupt. They capture and compromise. They hack and steal. They kill, poison, and assassinate. They wage unyielding information warfare on us relentlessly, again using our technology - the internet and open media - against us. 

**ACTIVE MEASURES**

And they have repeatedly sought to disrupt, influence, and rig elections. **But this last time, they went further.** They had been poking around trying to influence elections all over the world for decades. They have been doing it to US elections for decades. The US snoops too. But this time, the Russians took it one step further. They sought to disrupt and rig elections of one of the puppet masters. They attacked from a dozen different angles. They succeeded. They played on many of the west's weaknesses all in concert. And they succeeded in their attack. But they don't have the same weaknesses to attack. After all, nobody in Russia gets elected at all. [Nobody has even ever lost power due to losing an election.](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tpxxg1/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i2ehc3r/) Only one person has ever **won** an election at all at a national level since Putin took power: [Boris Nemtsov](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tpxxg1/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i2ehc3r/). And he was gunned down in the street. It was this among many other heinous acts which convinced the US and the west in general to keep the pressure on using the [Magnitsky Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act). (in fact, US Sen. McCain was one of the core reasons this act remained in effect, and he hand picked the above person and mentee of Boris Nemtsov to be McCain's pallbearer).

**THE RUSSIAN UNDERBELLY**

In the last decade, however, the west has noticed that this murky underworld of Russia has weaknesses too. Even with this massive military - we can't just invade, the nuclear weapons shield prevents that. We can't really compete in terms of corruption; we have corruption of our own but we can't influence their spies as effectively as their spies can influence our everything. So the west doesn't really have a handle on which to grab, to put pressure on or indeed retaliate for their transgressions. The core weakness is that - while the system of corruption makes these oligarchs incredibly rich, **they don't keep or reinvest that money into Russia**. After all, they know how it works. They understand the fragility of the system. They want to buy goods and services that Russia can not offer. They want to live like kings, in London and Geneva and on islands. They convert their money to Euros, into yachts, into dollars.

**A NEW SUPERWEAPON**

A new superweapon was discovered: sanctions. Because there's so much money stolen from the Russians, and because it's stored all over the world... you can simply freeze/cut it off. You can target these economic effects directly to the people and corporations involved with the activity, or make them more broad. But crucially, you can *really* put pressure on this huge kleptocratic class.

The bottom line is, there is now a weapon with which one the puppetmasters can directly attack the other, after decades of asymmetric warfare from the Russians operating in the dark against the open west. And this weapon has been used to greater and greater effect. And it's, again, **catalyzed** by the kleptocratic corruption of the Russian oligarchs and enabled by the self-interest of those oligarchs to further integrate into the world economy.

**SUMMARY**

That is what is fundamentally different about this war compared to the previous proxy wars. It's not that it's Ukraine, or that that Ukraine borders Russia. It's not NATO or the EU or the righteous belief in European democracies. It **is** about Ukraine's right to decide its own alliances, free from all of this dark corruption. It's not a battle of good versus evil in Ukraine vs Russia. Ukraine is a democracy, it may one day be filled with baddies. But they have a right to be a democracy, and they have a right to choose how they operate. But this is bigger than Ukraine. It's a the culmination of decades of struggle between a meanderingly corrupt democratic system versus a ravenously corrupt kleptocratic system. And one side discovered they had a new weapon.",1648495685.0,1648493939.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2gqn1w,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

I think that Russia attacking NATO territory is the line indeed. People keep getting killed and kidnapped, but the answer will keep being this ""Ukraine isn't NATO"". Which is sad. 

I've read some articles that suggest that Putin only understands power, so he perceives the West's lack of aggression as a weakness. And we need to step up because Putin will continue if he thinks the West isn't demonstrating its power. But the thing is, we don't really know.

The fact is, nuclear weapons means death for everyone.  A reasonably sane actor - which Putin *is*, like it or not - will not trigger the end of the world unless they're faced with the end of their world.

So long as we avoid that perception... things might be okay?  Obviously, the current mood is ""nobody wants to risk it"".  But, I think a limited intervention where we clearly stay away from Russian territory might actually work.

Sure, it gives Russia something to cry about... waah, NATO came in and trounced me!  But, will he trigger the *end of the fucking world*?  One would think not, particularly if you don't follow his troops over the border and generally just stay the fuck away as long as they stay the fuck home.

Stick to some good Twitter list and then you will see all the details coming from various channels but also be aware, we are witnessing biggest information war ever, take everything with grain of salt unless verified with trustful sources [official blue accounts at least].

Furthermore if they've had occasional reporting comparing the response to domestic issues or other wars, that has been a small (and appropriate) perspective shared that constitutes a tiny fraction of their broader and detailed coverage of all aspects of the invasion. Beyond reporting, they will host credentialed individuals with relevant experience to share their own opinions and analysis, which may diverge.

But fundamentally, NPR is a real news outlet resting on the foundation of journalistic standards and ethics. It may be late to report some of the things you point to, but that's because it's incumbent on them to meet a different fact-checking standard than people posting on social media. So you should not ""ignore"" NPR. You should understand that things posted on social may or may not be true and that things reported by NPR are almost certainly true, while guests expressing opinions there may be right or wrong but have a basis of knowledge and experience in the space that makes them worth listening to, and that they can offer a deeper and more informed analysis than social media posters. You can get news from both mediums while understanding their strengths and weaknesses.

EDIT: When a real news outlet is doing an enormous amount of coverage of a major geopolitical event, it's perfectly appropriate to have one article analyzing claims that NATO could have done things differently (and by the way, I don't ascribe any blame at all to NATO, personally, and I think these arguments take away agency from countries like Poland and the Baltic Republics who made their own, obviously wise decision to apply for NATO membership).

Ukraine seems to be making some limited gains at the moment, but Russia still has the numbers in their favor, and can regroup and refocus their efforts, and will either way be able to inflict immense damage almost indefinitely, regardless of what the Ukrainians do, and regardless of their declining troop morale.

As long as foreign supplies of weapons and general supply lines are not broken, the Ukrainians will likely be able to keep the Russians from making any meaningful progress for months and years. But that's a huge ""if"". The Russians seem to have been more actively trying to his supply lines and command centers, but whether or not they'll be successful at that is another question. Possibly not.

Personally, I don't think either side, nor external parties (i.e. NATO), are interested in a long drawn-out war, especially considering the very real economic and practical consequences, so I think we're fairly soon either going to see a quick de-escalation and ceasefire (or even an end to the war), where certain compromises are made, or a serious escalation where NATO countries interfere on some level (i.e. if Russia decides to use WMDs).

I have no idea what he meant by it, maybe only he knows. I think the walk back is clarifying that he doesn’t mean that the US will actively try to do anything about it (excluding any covert stuff which would be expected anyway). “Regime change” tends to have an action component understanding, which I take his follow up answer to of “no” being accurate. But the way I see his comment, right or wrong, is that the international community is not going to just go back to how it was operating with Russia until he is no longer the leader. And I think that is a very fair expectation. Putin saw the extent of his sanctions and insisted on doubling down and continuing. I don’t see how there is any way the rest of the world can now go back to doing business as usual with Russia as long as he is in charge. The message that would send would have huge ramifications.

This current Russian leadership is glaringly incapable. Normally I would assume the worst, but I haven't seen anything intelligent worthy of the name for over a month. Their blitzkrieg has become a predictable slogging match on major highways. An approach that minimizes the power of tanks and plays to the strengths of the defender. 

That said, Ukraine's leadership must approach cautiously and competently. But while overconfidence isn't smart, it isn't helpful to give into blind fear either.",False,1648478910.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2dyqg4,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

North Korea absolutely has the abilities to randomly shell Seoul.

The idea is to build enough of a threat on the border that if they do so, the counter-attack would be so intense that the North Koreans would never think of seriously harming Seoul.

So the question to Russia is: Do you want Ukrainian troops armed on the border, stationed forever more? And NATO weapons to continue to stream into Ukraine as long as that line is held? If this becomes a long-term protracted stalemate, you can bet your ass that Ukrainian Troops are going to be handed more-and-more advanced NATO weapons. Long term, we can build CRAM (counter-rocket, counter-artillery, counter-missile) defense systems in those cities, much like how Israel has an ""Iron Dome"".

Which is completely counterproductive to Russian interests. Russia wanted a buffer zone from NATO, not for NATO to move up and into ""West Ukraine"" (especially if ""West Ukraine"" includes large segments of the country to the East of the Dnieper). Sophisticated anti-artillery positions throughout Ukraine, early-warning missile systems, and other such technology would only hem Russia in even more.

rn Russian ""peacekeepers"" are holding down the fort to prevent Azerbaijan to retaking the land (since it's technically theirs but de facto independent). but then Ukraine happened, Russia (per social media videos) is withdrawing some of its troops to transfer for internal security + to UKR, and Azerbaijan (which, tbh, is led by a dictator who is as nuts as Putin but doesn't have as powerful/big a country to rule) said ""cool thanks, we'll be taking nagorno-karabakh back now.""

and then putin said ""get the fuck out"" and armenia said ""hey putin can you please send more troops"" but nothing happened, so it looks like Azerbaijan will continue to proceed with retaking the land and likely continuing their genocide of ethnic armenians. the fact that armenia is sending military to russia won't help reduce the fighting because less military in country = Azerbaijan sees signs of weakness and continues on its merry way. 

anyhow depending on how many russian troops and equipment are pulled out, this is likely to errupt into a full-scale hot war again - as r/worldnews has been predicting would happen since the first week of the UKR invasion tbh",False,1648508933.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2hxkf4,,2,13,0,13,1,0,

there is this taboo not to asses the value of human lives. understandably because of history but it has to be clear that some value is always inherently applied regardless whether we make an active decision or not. every safety measure and medical procedure is evaluating the cost per life saved and there is always a cost limit. there is also a continuum between a living human and a dead human. it makes no sense that it suddenly and arbitrarily turns from 100% to 0%. it also makes no sense that some intelligent animals are valued 0% while a person with very severe irreversible brain damage is valued 100%. what about an alien species. what about resurrected human species like the neanderthal? what about genetic hybrids? and all this doesnt even touch the topic of artificial intelligence. what does constitute an ai to be valued 100%? is it the ability to perform tasks as good as humans? if so, which tasks? or should only humans in flesh be treated as persons? how arbitrarily cruel and stupid would that be and what would that do this to our so highly valued morals? what about simulated people after brain uploads? is it considered human if it is better at everything or should another quality be the base for the decision? my suggestion is the ability to have empathy. the exclusion of human psychopaths is intentional.",False,1648501359.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2hckby,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

As you say though, there's just a total failure to react to changing circumstances, a major overestimation of their combat ability, and inability to understand the enormous logistical undertaking of supplying multiple widely spaced attacks stretching hundreds of km into defended territory on different fronts.

I reckon the last point in particular has Putin's personal signature all over it- no doubt he thinks he's an amateur military genius, and like I said the initial plan looks super sexy and great on paper, if you don't consider boring, technical questions like who is going to keep the hundreds of thousands of men and trucks and tanks spread around Ukraine in different locations fed and supplied and how to coordinate close air support across an entire country.

If after the initial setbacks around kyiv in the first 2 or 3 days they'd cut their losses and focused all of the northern effort on kharkiv, they would have been far better placed to pull off their original strategy. Instead they've flushed huge numbers of men, trucks and tanks down the toilet in a failed attempt to encircle kyiv, wasted a month and are now finally talking about more modest goals.

Japan is not resource rich, as a country. Leading to WWII, the US was its primary supplier, not only of oil, but of various materials, metals (we supplied more than 90% of their copper), etc. used by its military industry. Much like the current situation in Ukraine, the US responded to Japanese aggression in China with diplomatic complaints and a slowly-increasing sanctions regime. This took place over years: ending a normal trade pact in 1939, passing the Export Control Act in 1940. Near the end of 1940 they closed the Panama Canal along with further embargos (of metal in particular). 

Facing difficulty in obtaining fuel, Japan looked toward Indochina, under control of the puppet (Nazi controlled) French government, but it was unable to meet their supply.

In home politics he was a Little Englander, a true hater of jingoism and imperialism, and according to his lights a true friend of democracy. Yet when he looked outwards into the international field, he could forsake his principles without even noticing he was doing so. Thus, his almost mystical belief in the virtues of democracy did not prevent him from admiring Mussolini. Mussolini had destroyed the representative government and the freedom of the press for which Chesterton had struggled so hard at home, but Mussolini was an Italian and had made Italy strong, and that settled the matter. Nor did Chesterton ever find a word to say about imperialism and the conquest of coloured races when they were practised by Italians or Frenchmen. His hold on reality, his literary taste, and even to some extent his moral sense, were dislocated as soon as his nationalistic loyalties were involved*.""

Also in regards to the gas prices being the true tragedy of the war I don’t back down from that statement, but it requires more context than what you’re providing here. 

Gas and oil prices going up doesn’t just hurt Americans at the pump (though it absolutely does) its also critical in manufacturing, agriculture, and infrastructure. This will have a cascading effect. Now maybe those in the middle and upper middle class that makes up the wide majority of Reddit can afford it the poor in the depths of poverty will not. The law of marginal utility makes it so that in increase in price of demand inelasticity products like oil will hurt the poorest the most. 

Now of course many believe that this cost is worth it to help Ukraine (and that’s what the vast majority of people on neoliberal believe) but I do not. This is because I a patriot care more about my fellow countrymen more than a people on the other side of the globe.

 >Havana syndrome is an alleged set of medical symptoms with unknown causes experienced mostly abroad by U.S. government officials and military personnel. The symptoms range in severity from pain and ringing in the ears to cognitive difficulties and were first reported in 2016 by U.S. and Canadian embassy staff in Havana, Cuba. Beginning in 2017, more people, including U.S. intelligence and military personnel and their families, reported having these symptoms in other places, such as China, New Delhi, India, Europe, and Washington, D.C. The cause and validity of the illness have yet to be determined.

But on the other hand, ‘demilitarizing’ the Russian bases near Ukrainian territory used to launch this invasion would go a hell of a long way in ensuring long term security for Ukraine and protecting them from future incursions while they rebuild. If the Russian military and logistical infrastructure near the border isn’t seriously reduced by the Ukrainians before the end of the war, it makes it disproportionately easy for Russia to launch future attacks before Ukraine can recover and rebuild from this war.

Whatever the outcome of the war, it’s almost guaranteed to cause long term economic and stability issues- for decades even- in Ukraine. If Russia isn’t proportionately reduced in economic and especially military capacity, a follow up invasion years down the line would be stilted much more in Russian favor. So it’s a double edged sword of Ukraine pushing into Russian territory now (assuming they even can, of course) and possibly triggering a larger war and/ or losing western support, _or_ leaving yourself vulnerable to the third invasion this century. And that’s not to mention the multiple times Russia launched incursions or invasions of Ukraine roughly a hundred years ago (depending on how you count the war(s) they fought in the interwar period of WW1 and WW2. And then there’s all the WW1 and WW2 fighting in Ukraine.

 You might recall the lies and gross mismanagement of our withdrawal from Afghanistan where we abandoned tens of thousands whom we had promised to protect.  Biden promised that no Americans would be left behind, yet it took a massive, private effort to rescue not only Americans but those whom we had promised to take with us if we left Afghanistan.  You might also recall Biden putting the State Department in charge of the Kabul Airport  including the Marines and other military.  It got a lot of Marines killed  ,  while Biden attended the arrival of their flag draped coffins at Andrews he was obviously more interested in checking his watch to make sure he was not late for his fundraising. 

What Putin heard but you never saw on the national news was that we abandoned American citizens who were inside the fence of the Kabul airport.  Because the State department had not approved their presence and the military were, at the President's orders reporting to the State Department , they were turned over to the Taliban. 

Other allies were going back into Kabul to rescue their citizens but Biden forbid US troops from leaving the airport.  Thankfully, many former military who had served made the dangerous trips. 

Unless you watched some of the ""non network"" news sources privately funded US efforts, operating outside the administration rescued and evacuated more than 10,000 most of whom would have been killed or imprisoned by the Taliban.

Early on (pre invasion) I started focusing on two things I thought would have the largest impact that I wasn't sure of. I was confident of Ukrainian morale (having met a few over the years) and I was confident Russia would be stuck to the roads past a certain point. What I didn't know but thought would have a long term influence:

1. Kyiv; how hard to attack and defend, the geography of the area, etc.

2. Ukraine's training and experience, if their standing Army is well trained then given time that will filter to reserves/conscripts.

Once I understood how much of a nightmare 1) is for an invader and the time they had to prepare and how Ukraine had been getting training from the US and had been rotating their forces out of the conflict zone I couldn't understand Putins strategy.

Eventually I reached a conclusion that he was making crazy decisions either from being a bit mad or more likely because garbage in, garbage out being that his intel and assumptions about Ukraine were wrong.

and then putin said ""get the fuck out"" and armenia said ""hey putin can you please send more troops"" but nothing happened, so it looks like Azerbaijan will continue to proceed with retaking the land and likely continuing their genocide of ethnic armenians. the fact that armenia is sending military to russia won't help reduce the fighting because less military in country = Azerbaijan sees signs of weakness and continues on its merry way.

> The Russian reserve has over two million former conscripts and contract servicemen on paper, but few are actively trained or prepared for war. Historically, only 10 percent of reservists receive refresher training after completing their initial term of service. Russia lacks the administrative and financial capacity to train reservists on an ongoing basis. According to a 2019 RAND analysis, Russia only had 4,000 to 5,000 troops in what would be considered an active reserve in the Western sense, meaning soldiers attending regular monthly and annual training. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has repeatedly stated that the Russian Armed Forces hoped to have 80,000-100,000 active reserve members.

> [...]

> Russia is likely rapidly exhausting the manpower it can readily use to generate additional effective combat power even as its forces lose combat effectiveness in Ukraine amid high losses. Russian efforts to mobilize more manpower can bring more people into Russian combat units, but those people are unlikely to be well-enough trained or motivated to generate large amounts of new combat power.

> Mobilization efforts are likely to start producing diminishing returns as Russia moves through the categories of fully-trained and recently-released reservists into categories of people further removed from their initial military experiences and/or those who will undergo hasty training before deployment to the front lines. Individual replacements for battlefield losses are unlikely to have the same training as their predecessors, and new units or those reinforced by these augmentees will not have undergone unit-level training prior to employment. More units and reservist replacements will likely appear in Ukraine, therefore, but the net effect on Russia’s actual combat capability will likely be small and diminishing.",False,1648508717.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2hv6eh,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

 >Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama (; born October 27, 1952) is an American political scientist, political economist, and writer. Fukuyama is known for his book The End of History and the Last Man (1992), which argues that the worldwide spread of liberal democracies and free-market capitalism of the West and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government, an assessment met with criticisms. In his subsequent book Trust: Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity (1995), he modified his earlier position to acknowledge that culture cannot be cleanly separated from economics.

Yep, a core of capable, experienced NCOs and junior officers is really the key to getting stuff done, because they are the people who are responsible for figuring out how to implement orders from higher level commanders based on the conditions on the ground. Good NCOs and junior officers are even more critical when you're working with conscripts- the huge tactical ineptness we've seen again and again from russian troops,  their paralysis when under fire, and the repeated killing of russian colonels and generals who have gotten too close to the front suggest they lack that mid level group- it is as if there is no conduit at all between high command and the conscript private soldiers - so Russian generals can issue an order to a tank battalion to commence an  assault on kyev, but there is no one on the ground who seems to understand how to do that, how tanks are supposed to cooperate with infantry, what to do if they come under fire, any of that stuff, which means higher officers are needing to go forward and personally supervise movement, and keep getting shot when they do.

Since everyone likes the Putin/Hitler comparison, it is worth noting how much better the Wehrmacht was at developing their junior officers and NCOs. Pre world war 2 the germans were limited by the treaty of versailles in terms of the size of the army they could field- they got around this in two ways- by ensuring that pretty much the entire population had rotated through their conscript training so they could be called up when needed, but also by training their  professional core of soldiers to a higher standard than needed by their on paper ranks- the result was that when they finally openly ditched the treaty of versailles, they had a large pool of soldiers who could quickly step up to more senior NCO roles to help train and supervise conscripts, senior NCOs who were capable of commanding platoons and companies, and junior officers who could act on their own initiative and think like battalion and regimental commanders when facing tactical problems.

If there is one lesson to be taken out of this war, it is that thousands of tanks, hypersonic missiles and 5th generation strike fighters might make for impressive military parades, but unglamorous investments in human resources are far more important when it comes to getting shit done.

Russia is budgeting about 2 billion USD to continue to develop a 5th gen stealth fighter it simply doesn't need, and which it will never be able to field in sufficient numbers to challenge american air dominance- its probably a good thing noone has suggested to them that 5 years ago they spend a fraction of that sum on proper training, recruitment and remuneration of NCOs across all three services, because if they had I doubt very much Kyiv would still be a free city.",False,1648450847.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2elvvn,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Moscow and Kyiv are discussing a pause in hostilities as part of a possible deal that would involve Ukraine abandoning its drive for Nato membership in exchange for security guarantees and the prospect to join the EU, the people said under the condition of anonymity because the matter is not yet finalised. The draft ceasefire document does not contain any discussion of three of Russia’s initial core demands — “denazification”, “demilitarisation”, and legal protection for the Russian language in Ukraine — the people added.  
Envoys from both sides meet in Istanbul on Tuesday in a fourth round of peace talks designed to end president Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The concessions on Russia’s side come as its month-long ground offensive has largely stalled as a result of fiercer Ukrainian resistance than expected and Russian operational deficiencies.  
But Ukraine and its western backers remain sceptical of Putin’s intentions, worrying that the Russian president could be using the talks as a smokescreen to replenish his exhausted forces and plan a fresh offensive.  
David Arakhamia, head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s party in parliament and a member of Kyiv’s negotiating team, told the FT the parties were close to agreement on the security guarantees and Ukraine’s EU bid but urged caution about prospects for a breakthrough.  
“All the issues” have been “on the table since the beginning” of negotiations but “lots of points — like in every single item there are unresolved points”, Arakhamia said.  
Another person briefed on the talks said Ukraine was concerned that Russia was shifting its position almost day by day, both in terms of military pressure and on demands like Kyiv’s “demilitarisation.”  
As part of the agreement under consideration, Ukraine would also refrain from developing nuclear weapons, or hosting foreign military bases in addition to abandoning its pursuit of Nato membership.  
In exchange, Ukraine would get what Arakhamia called “wording close to Nato’s Article 5” — whereby the alliances’ members must come to each others’ aid if one is attacked — for security guarantees from countries including Russia, the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, China, Italy, Poland, Israel, and Turkey.  
Any prospective agreement, however, would have to be agreed with the guarantors and ratified by their parliaments, Zelensky said on Sunday.  
The prospective guarantors have yet to agree to uphold Ukraine’s security, the people said. “We do not have any rejections so far,” Arakhamia said.  
Ukraine would put the deal to a referendum in several months’ time before changing its constitution, said Zelensky — a process that could require at least a year.  
Moscow, Arakhamia said, was demanding that Ukraine recognise Russia’s control over the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as well as two territories run by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region.  
“We will never recognise any kind of borders except as they are in our Declaration of Independence,” Arakhamia said. “This is the most critical point.”  
For now, Ukraine was prepared to discuss some humanitarian issues, such as restoring Crimea’s water supply and pledging never to try to retake the peninsula by force, the people said.  
If a ceasefire holds, Ukraine and Russia’s foreign ministers would then meet to draft separate documents to finalise the security guarantees and further agreements on social issues such as protection of the Russian language in Ukraine. This would then be followed by attempts to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, although Peskov on Monday said there had been “no movement” on arranging such an encounter.",False,1648495545.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2h1s8y,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Let me quote the last one, since google seems beyond you:

> A total of 73 aircraft, nearly 100 vehicles and other equipment were abandoned by US troops as they pulled out ahead of the 31 August deadline.

> But US Central Command head Gen Kenneth McKenzie said it had all been rendered impossible to use.

> ""Those aircraft will never fly again,"" he said.

[...]

> According to Gen McKenzie, 70 mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAPs) were also abandoned, after being disabled.

[...]

> And experts point out some aircraft may be of very limited use to the Taliban **without trained pilots, maintenance and access to spare parts.**

(my emphasis) Exactly what i've been saying.  Whatever they can use, won't last.

> But, although is impossible to establish a specific number, most of the 167 aircraft, including 33 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, under the control of the Afghan armed forces at the end of June, are now thought to be in Taliban hands.

Whatever wasn't trashed might be usable for a short while - if you know how to use it.  Then it falls into disrepair.

Basically, what they *can* showboat is the badass guns.  Maybe some vehicles.

Here's some more from a different article:

> In one video, militants dressed in US-style uniforms and holding US-made weapons examined a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter parked inside a hangar. Taliban fighters were also seen posing for photographs while sitting in the cockpits of planes and helicopters that once belonged to the Afghan Air Force.

[...]

> But Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN Tuesday he wasn't ""overly concerned about these images"" of Taliban fighters examining the abandoned aircraft.

> ""They can inspect all they want,"" Kirby said. ""They can look at them, they can walk around -- but they can't fly them. They can't operate them.""  He added that the US military had made ""unusable all the gear that is at the airport -- all the aircraft, all the ground vehicles,"" leaving only some fire trucks and fork lifts operational.

I mean, if you don't believe the Pentagon spokesman, fine.  I can't help you.  But what was left behind in Afghanistan was a combination of a) not worth getting out, b) trivially rendered inoperable, c) complex to maintain/operate if it does work, and finally d) of no viable long-term use.

The outcome of this war was determined when Russian advances came grinding to a halt in the second week. The only chance they had was a psychological victory where the Ukrainians would be too frightened and poorly-prepared to fight back and Russia rolled into Kyiv. The exact opposite happened. Russia has already suffered about 35,000 casualties, including 17,000 dead. Their logistics are absolute shit, and they've essentially abandoned tens of thousands of soldiers in the country and given them objectives that they can't possibly achieve with little-to-no possibility of receiving any extra support for at least several weeks. It's a complete clusterfuck. They've lost more than 2000 vehicles. Their remaining equipment is in complete shambles, as is the morale of their troops.

Even if the Russians start taking cities again, it's obvious that they can't hold them. 

It's obvious that they fucked this whole thing up badly, and there's very little possibility of them finding their footing and un-fucking the situation, especially since they seem to be in complete denial about the reality on the ground. Even if they're able to go 1-for-1 with Ukrainians in terms of casualties, the second they cross that 25-30% threshold for casualties (about 50-60,000 soldiers out of the original 200,000), the whole deck of cards is going to come crashing down. *Hard*.

Both of the times you listed are from post war memoirs. and the German commanders after World War 2 were desperate to make up any reason for their loss.

This is where the myth of the honorable German General comes from. 

The T-34 was inferior to most German tanks it saw in the beginning of the war. It lacked the ammo to pen the Panzer 4 from the front at distance where as the Panzer 4 could knock it out at distance even with it's shorter 75MM gun.

The T-34 was well known to have horrific optics for the commander and driver and it was almost blind if it was buttoned down. 

Add in the fact that most T-34's didn't have radio's.

We could also add in the laundry list of manufacturing problems with the T-34:

The engines would literlly destroy themselves due to insufficient heat treating.

The armor due to being made at a higher temperature would kill the crew even if a shot bounced thanks to spalling.

The list really does go on and on.

But I'll end it with this: Their is a reason why the T-34 was abandoned by the soviets right after the end of World War 2. Even they knew it was a shit design. That's why the designed the T-54. Which was far more successful than the T-34 was.",False,1648490371.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2gofw8,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

However, as a counterpoint, we in the West:

+ Still use the B-52.

+ Still use sniper rifle platforms that predate the Vietnam War

+ Have tanks that are 40 years old.

As a counterpoint to this counterpoint though:

+ The B-52s have gone through a substantial upgrade and refurbishment programme including new engines and avionics, the thing that's been retained is the essentially impossible to substantially improve upon ""tube with swept wings"" design of the airframe.

+ The sniper rifles have undergone significant maintenance including the transfer of the action into a modern polymer stock and the use of modern accessory rails and optics.

+ The tanks have had numerous retrofitted packages including EW and ERA systems, and they're also part of a much wider system of combined arms.

The key difference, for me, is that Western retention of older platforms is cherry picked, predominantly focused on already well developed areas that lack disruptive technologies, doesn't shy away from maintenance and upgrades, and essentially embodies ""*if it ain't broke don't fix it*"". Russian retention of older platforms is standard, endemic, lacks understanding, and arguably follows a ""*don't fix it even if it's broke*"" attitude of blindness and disinterest.",False,1648506589.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2han7j,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia IS going to run out of soldiers within the next two months unless they fully mobilize their reserves and start throwing rear echelon troops into combat. Neither of those are likely to result in increased combat effectiveness.

I haven't said Putin didn't do it, and on top of that you are asking me to prove a negative. What I said is: ""they"" (someone who was poisoned) ""suspect hardliners."" I'm sure Putin counts as a hardliner.

What we do know, is that Abramovich was possibly poisoned on March 3rd 2022 and sometime in the [last week](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10658889/Roman-Abramovich-gave-Putin-handwritten-note-Zelensky.html) he went and saw Putin personally.

The comment chain above you indicates otherwise. The article discusses the drones being controlled through Starlink connections. While it is unclear EXACTLY what that means, many drone systems can be controlled remotely through base stations provided those stations have network access. The implication there is that the base stations are being connected to forward deployed Starlink terminals while the controllers/pilots are in another location with their own terminal.

One accidental advantage that Starlink has over a variety of standard GEO satellite communications for this conflict is that Dishy is a phased array antenna that engages in beamforming (essentially, the panel nearly never needs to reorient itself physically after installation, it can electronically steer the beam without any moving parts) for the purpose of efficiency. In short, the signal is highly directed. A pencil beam vs the largely omnidirectional signal of satellite phones and the like (though there are semi-directional fixed antenna systems). Yes, you get sidelobes and such, but that's where orbital mechanics comes to accidentally help again.

With the low orbital altitude of Starlink satellites comes a high traversal velocity across the sky. Unlike satellites out at GEO, the Starlink ones are moving relative to the ground at a fairly decent rate (thus why they have electronic steering). If you assume both standard and Starlink communications are happening with pencil-beams for fairness, the situation is thus. From the perspective of someone looking for these signals they will only find them if their gear happens to effectively fly through the beam (or near enough for sidelobes to register). In the case of a GEO satellite, if the seeker is in a helicopter, they can circle back to where they were before. Since the GEO satellite is effectively not moving, the beam from the standard system isn't moving either. So circling back has a solid chance of reacquiring the signal link, allowing for targeting. When it comes to Starlink, because the satellites are moving (and moving across different orbital tracks/inclinations), you cannot just circle back to where you were, because the beam isn't necessarily pointed in that direction anymore. If you hold that position for several minutes then you'll likely get subsequent short pings from the system as it sweeps through your position. Given the current prevalence of MANPADs in Ukraine, the likelihood of such a scenario seems small.

GEO communications units though tend to either be omnidirectional (hand-held units) or Yagi-Antenna style semi-directed (think a rounded cone) for their signals. As such, they have the ""weakness"" of being both more likely to be seen as well as easier to backtrack once seen.

Now, Starlink's biggest weakness in this situation is that Dishy gets quite warm while in operation, which would show up on thermal sensors. However there are a variety of ways you can conceal Dishy without (seriously) compromising signal performance, or otherwise break up the visible thermal signature so that it looks like something else unremarkable.",False,1648509535.0,t3_tpxxg1,t1_i2gmhfd,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
