Day 231 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was another quiet day, there was just one missile launch from Belgorod at 5:40pm, but thankfully it was intercepted. I’m pretty sure there were no more missile strikes after that. We still did have a lot of air raid alerts, and the last one is still active right now. It has already been active for three and a half hours by this point, though nothing happened so far, so someone might have just forgot to turn if off. 

Another thing that happened is that AA in Belgorod was very active at around 5:50pm, which just so happened to be right after they launched some missiles in our direction. So now they are getting hit back basically every time they fire some missiles in our direction. I don’t think anything was hit in Belgorod, but there were quite a lot of explosions over it, apparently they fired about 10 AA missiles to intercept something.

Quite a lot of missiles (and kamikaze drones) were fired at many of our cities today, but it looks like pretty much all of them were intercepted, because they aren’t firing nearly enough missiles to overwhelm our AA now. It will be even better when we get more of the new AA systems, after that they won’t be able to hit our cities with impunity anymore.",False,1665622297.0,t3_y1tjhz,t3_y1tjhz,,0,173,0,173,1,0,

How can anyone be willing to compromise with them after all that we have seen and heard from Russia? Dont we remember how the allies were unflinching in their determination to win the war during WW2? It shouldn't be any different now. It is simply the right thing to do, like our ancestors did. Anything less than Russia getting kicked out of Ukraine completely and it being held as accountable as possible for its crimes would be a sign that the rule of law and our strength has weakened; that the post WW2 order no longer has any meaning. I am so shocked by the barbarism Russia is demonstrating. I knew they were ''edgy'' and had done bad things before, but this war is showing truly how barbaric the Russian mind is. Too many Russians are so brainwashed into serfdom, and are incapable of empathy. How a people can fail so hard at seeing its own mistakes is hard to fathom for me. But that's the Russian people, for the most part. The few Russians who have realized the error of their ways give me a bit of hope, but then I remember than millions upon millions of Russians keep following Putin into this madness, out of indifference, fear, greed and bloodthirst.

There are people so barbaric and brainwashed that negociation is simply impossible until they are kicked in the teeth. They will lie, deceive and gaslight so much until they obtain their victory. For these people, there are no rules. Just brutality and deception. People who try to ''negociate'' with Putin thinking they are doing something good at this point are just deceiving themselves. Putin is absolutely, completely, irredeemable.

So what if prices are higher and we have to put a few more blankets on? Freedom has a price, and it is the Ukrainians that are paying the greatest share of that price right now; with their lives.

After suffering a humiliating attack on the Crimean Bridge, Putin's response has been a strategically pointless bombardment of civilian infrastructure.

This is important because it means there are things he cares about more than winning the war.

And given the weather is coming and you can sincerly doubt that Russia will have any way to hide IR emission.

""Putin: Russia can supply gas through Nord Stream 2 or through 'gas hub' in Turkey

  
Russian President Putin says Russia can still supply gas to Europe through the intact parts of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In fact, he says, a major ""gas hub"" for Europe could be set up in Turkey, where the gas from the Nord Stream pipeline could be transported across the bottom of the Baltic Sea. The ball is in the European Union's court, Putin said: it must decide what is desirable.

  
  
EU countries are trying to reduce dependence on Russian gas. The aim is for European gas stocks to be 80 percent full by 1 November at the latest. Two weeks ago , the European Commission also laid a legal basis for a price cap for oil from Russia.

  
  
Putin said that Russia will not supply energy to countries with such a price ceiling. He also spoke of the ""aggressive promotion of green energy"" in the European Union, which he says leads to ""underinvestment"" in oil and gas. Renewable energy should not become a political issue, he said.

  
  
The European Commission is also advocating a price cap for gas from Russia as part of plans to tackle the energy crisis, but it is still unclear whether this will actually happen. Today, European energy ministers are meeting for a meeting about skyrocketing prices in the energy market. President Putin also said that Russia is not responsible for that.

  
  
Sabotage Nord Stream

  
Several holes were found in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany at the end of last month after an explosion that led to a gas leak. According to Western countries, Russia is responsible for this, but the Kremlin has consistently denied involvement. President Putin again accused the United States of sabotage, which he called an ""act of international terrorism"".""

Originally it just seemed to be the only possible delivery method for that much explosive force undetected is some sort of submersible/drone boat, given it didn't seem to be a missile of some sort. But that submersible would still have to be pretty large. 

The truck being right there and being able to deliver an explosive payload makes sense to me, but I'm skeptical about being able to find a willing defector to pack the truck as a suicide bomb. Similar questions arise wondering how it could be loaded with explosives without the driver knowing and ready to detonate at a precise location in transit.

That Russia could simply have failed colossally in their security makes sense to me, but at that point I go back to thinking waterborne SOF planted explosives or something...


Does anyone have any good links to arguments or analysis that argue one way or another, or attempt to explain some of these questions?

af23e7145f14ed31ab3d8e13539235e5,y1tjhz,is18sma,"The invasion was never about keeping NATO at bay. That is a line Russia takes purely for the purposes of painting itself as somehow the victim (Russia was “forced” into invasion, was “encircled”, etc.). This works on Tankies and other reflexively anti-Western folks, but it was always nonsense. 

The real reason for invasion was simple: Putin’s historical vision for Russia required Russia to own Ukraine and, in particular, Kyiv. Like the Nazis, Putinites are very interested in history (albeit their own version of history), and to them, the Kyivian Rus of the medieval era is the foundation of Russia. Only, the Russians, not the Ukrainians currently living there, are the inheritors of a uniquely “Russian” civilization. 

The Ukrainians have fallen from the true path of Russian civilization. They are not a “real” nation and the Ukrainian language is not a “real” language; they are simply bumpkinish Russians and their language a backwards dialect of Russian. 

What is worse, Putinite Russia sees itself in a clash of civilizations with Europe. Russia (in the Putinite vision) stands for virile traditional values, while Europe is degenerate. The Putinites focus on homosexuality as the exemplar of this - which is why they so bizarrely keep bringing up their homophobia in the context of their attack on Ukraine. They are crusading for Russian values. Ukraine, turning towards Europe with the whole Euromaidan thing, is turning its back on “true” Russian civilization. By definition, they must be infected with degeneracy, which in the Putinite mind, includes of necessity homosexuality. 

So, to forward the Russian version of manifest destiny, Ukraine must be brought back within the Russian fold, by force if necessary. They must be re-educated in proper Russian values. 

NATO is a problem purely to the extent that they appear to block this necessary ‘reunification’. It certainly was not the inspiration for it. 

This is why the war can’t end in some sort of reasonable compromise with Putin. No such compromise is possible, because Putin will never cease to believe that Ukraine must be incorporated into Russia. Even if one wanted to just hand some territory over to Putin and call it a day, that will never work, because Putin will only view such a concession as a stepping-stone towards his ultimate goal.

Russia usually projects their plans ahead of time, including laying seeds of information. So pushing the ""NATO is a nuclear aggressor"" narrative fits with them trying to sell the use of any such weapons (should they do so) if they're planning to frame that use as ""defensive"" to their population.

She didn't follow US politics as much as I do, so she thought Trump was just a silly goof and she really didn't care about the outcome. 

I told her that one day Russia is going to invade her home country of Ukraine (I have believed this since 2015) and if Trump is president for another term, that will be the end of her country. HUGE relief when Biden won. Like, HUGE.

I don't even want to imagine what the situation would be if Trump had won. My in-laws were trapped in occupied territory for almost 7 months before finally escaping to Poland. I have no doubt they would either still be trapped there, or more likely dead (given their region in Kharkiv Oblast was liberated recently). My wife was also visiting her family in Ukraine when the war broke out and was trapped there for 3 weeks before escaping. Very real possibility she would be still there or worse.

Anybody who thinks that Trump would have handled this conflict any better is so far gone and stupid, there is no reaching them. The only thing that I have against Biden is that he is old AF.

Contrast that to the news that 10,000 freshly-trained Ukrainian soldiers are returning from Britain today, equipped with NATO gear. And the last batch that just returned a few weeks ago was 5,000. So in a matter of 1-2 months Ukraine has trained and equipped as many soldiers as Belarus could reasonably mobilize at all. 

Another way to put things in perspective - Belarus has a total population of around 10 million. London itself is home to 9 million people. Belarus just doesn't have the numbers to do much, here. And even if they went all-in, they wouldn't be able to equip or train the way Ukraine can with NATO help. And Russia is already plundering Belarusian equipment for itself.

The dictator wants land. They try to take piece by piece without provoking a reaction. That’s what Russia did in 2014 with Crimea, and what Germany did with the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. They know they cannot win a war against the rest of the world, so they try to avoid that while still taking territory.

The rest of the world want to avoid war, at *almost* any cost. They try to reason with the dictator, and even make limited concessions (officially or unofficially - like simply not responding when Russia annexed Crimea), because that’s the “obvious”, most reasonable thing to try first.

Eventually, Hitler pushed too far, and there had to be war. Supposedly, he was actually surprised when Britain and France declared war on Germany - he really thought he’d get away with invading Poland, and they’d back down again! It seems the same is happening with Putin - he thought it would be a 3-day war, Europe would be too scared to risk their gas supply to intervene, and by the time any support could be organised it would be too late. He must be really shocked at how things actually played out.

Things are a bit different this time - the west is sending weapons, ammunition, money, medical equipment, humanitarian aid, intelligence support, and basically everything they can while not getting directly involved.

The truth is that the overwhelming majority of American voters don't care about the war in Russia and Ukraine.  They are focused on domestic issues.  This has given the American political class maneuverability on the issue, and when American politicians have the ability to move, they tend to move towards their donors, in this case, the U.S. military industrial complex.  

President Biden and some politicians who are foreign policy specialists might be in this for geopolitical reasons (Very few are in it for humanitarian/altruistic reasons.  Don't give the U.S. that much credit.), but most of the rank-and-file are in it because that is where the money is.  This is why support for Ukraine has been, thus far, bipartisan.

The problem is that Trump, Tucker Carlson, and a few other notable right-wing influencers are starting to make the Republican base care about this war, and side with Russia (Or at least, side with stopping the funding of Ukraine).  If this effort reaches a critical mass, the Republican political class will be forced to bow to it as they bow to Trump on everything he gets the base angry about.

Now, fortunately, the ranking members of Congress foresaw this, and set up a program (Lend/Lease) by where Biden can continue arming the Ukrainians without further Congressional approval, but that program expires on October 1 of 2023 unless Congress re-authorizes it, which with a Republican controlled House, might not happen.  

Even this though does not give President Biden authority to send everything that Ukraine wants.  Also, if Ukraine wins, Congress will have to authorize reconstruction funds.  That might be tricky with a Republican controlled House.  All of this will depend on how much Trump can get the Republican base to care about cutting off support to Ukraine and the Republican political class's willingness to cross Trump, and if history is any guide, that's a very risky bet.",1665574841.0,1665574347.0,t3_y1tjhz,t1_irzzmuw,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

af23e7145f14ed31ab3d8e13539235e5,y1tjhz,is0eui9,"To add to what others have said: Putin’s vision is based on an essentially historic vision of “Russian”civilization that stretches back in time to the Kyvian Rus of the Middle Ages. In that vision, what is now Ukraine, and in particular Kyiv, is very important - the “mother of cities” and the foundation of “Russia”. A “Russia” that does not include Kyiv and Ukraine is, in the Putinite view, a diminished, incomplete, mutilated entity. 

However, this vision does not extend to modern-day Ukrainians and their language and culture - the people who happen to actually live there. In his view, Ukraine is not a “real” state, Ukrainian is not a “real” ethnicity, and the Ukrainian language is not a “real” language. Rather, they are just a bumpkinish version of Russians, their language a sort of backwards dialect of Russian. 

In Putin’s mind, Ukraine must be “returned” to Russia (his historic vision demands this), while its people must be re-educated into being “proper” Russians. Those who refuse are enemies and traitors. 

This is, in his view, a basic clash of civilizations - because to him, Russian civilization is very different from (and superior to) European civilization. Not only are the Ukrainians just a backward version of Russians, not only are they squatting in the “mother of cities”, they compound these errors and provocations by wanting to leave the fold of Russian civilization and join the civilization of Europe - a civilization that Putinites consider wholly degenerate. Hence the otherwise bizarre fixation of the Putinites on homosexuality (a horrible perversion to them), which otherwise would appear completely irrelevant - like most Eastern European nations, Ukraine has its share of homophobia, but in Putin’s eyes the desire to join Europe means a sort of cultural betrayal in which Ukraine will of necessity accept “alien” European values such as acceptance of gays. 

TLDR: Putin’s imperial land grab is, in his mind, aimed at a sort of Russian manifest destiny, in which Russian civilization is battling European civilization over the historic territory of holy Russia. The actual people who live there must be forcibly brought back into the fold (or killed if they are “traitors”).",False,1665576404.0,t3_y1tjhz,t1_is07csi,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

That's a myth based on a basic misunderstanding of the A-10's design. And it's a myth the USAF has spent decades spreading, because they've never really wanted the A-10.


The A-10 was designed for what would have been one of the largest battles in human history if the Cold War had turned hot (the Fulda Gap). That means the basic assumption was that it would be operating in heavily contested airspace. Hence why the key focus was on survivability.

Most of the fighting is not in areas that Russia has air superiority.  Combined with what should be Ukraine's knowledge of where most of Russia's AA is thanks to their own intelligence plus round the clock surveillance from NATO, A-10s would absolutely have an effective role.  The idea that A-10s would just burst into flames the second they took off in Ukraine is a meme from the anti-A-10 circlejerk who are worse than the A-10 fanboys at this point.

edit:  I forgot to mention what is another big factor - Ukraine's ability to suppress Russia's air defenses with HARMs.

Netherlands to supply anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine  
Ukraine will receive air defense missiles from the Netherlands, worth 15 million euros. Defense Minister Ollongren announced this today at the start of the NATO meeting in Brussels.  
""We have seen really cowardly attacks on all kinds of cities in Ukraine, where civilian infrastructure has been attacked and innocent civilians have been the victims,"" Ollongren said. ""The only thing Putin achieves with this is that we will deliver even more.""  
The Netherlands is also looking at contributing to winter equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. Further details on material support were not given by the minister.  
Other countries also announced today that they will send more equipment to Ukraine. For example, the German Defense Minister pledged more armored howitzers. She also announced that Germany has handed over the first of four anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine.

 >The Wiesel 2 is a stretched version of the Wiesel 1, with a fifth roadwheel. The engine was changed to a 1. 9L Volkswagen in-line four-cylinder turbo diesel with direct injection and intercooler, giving 109 hp (81 kW) coupled to a ZF automatic transmission. The Wiesel 2 is generally bigger, faster and stronger than the Wiesel 1, with advanced features for the protection of the crew such as enhanced armour, an air conditioning system, and NBC protection.

The only major ""shock"" to their defense industry would be a fighter jet and tank transition to Western standards. Mainly as the maintenance is very different.

Russia obviously has not been performing like professional soldiers, but when Ukraine attacks, it's tens of thousands of trained and equipped troops with enough tanks, HIMARS, artillery, and air support including jets and.helicopters to overwhelm the Russian lines.  

So my point is, in warfare, ""losing the initiative"" means you no longer have the men and equipment to dictate where the fight is.  You can't ""attack"" anywhere.  Not with the numbers that are required to be successful.  Russia lost the initiative in May of this year and did not plan ahead with training/recruitment/arms production for a prolonged war.  They were hoping for a 3 day war because they could barely pull that off.

Unless Russia actually pulls off the mobilization with tens of thousands of new, capable, equipped troops with the supplies to keep them fed, warm, healthy and mobile then their attacks are likely just anything they can throw at the UA lines to cause casualties.  Some drones, some artillery, some sporadic air strikes/cruise missiles. 

If Russia was capable of an actual counterattack to put UA on their heels, there wouldn't be attacks against civilian targets.  Russia knows it cannot win from a military standpoint so they're hoping to cause morale/support to drop and Ukraine's will to fight, which actually doesn't work when you use that method against the defending nation.  It works with wars like U.S. in Iraq/Afghanistan or Vietnam where it just becomes too expensive and not worth the cost of life to keep fighting for any other reason than to survive and defend your home.  Ukraine is defending themselves and their way of life from brutal torturers, rapists and murderers.  I'm thinking most Ukrainians would rather die than let Russia win.

I would never claim to presuppose him in defense terms, but his projection on future conflicts are contingent on Russia being able to resupply/stockpile going forward, and I frankly don't ever see that happening. The sanctions on Russia will never be lifted until serious regime and policy changes happen, and they will come with concessions. 

I thought this interview was brilliant, but I'd like to see this defense analyst paired together with some economic analysts, and maybe some technology ones. Even if Russia goes into full war economy mode, they don't have the domestic capability to produce things like computer chips for smart weapons. And due to decades of corruption they can't even maintain the stockpile they currently have. 

Furthermore, after this conflict is over (with a Ukrainian victory), it will probably become an EU state and member of NATO at some point, while Russia will suffer from being cut off from the rest of the world. When that happens the possibility of another attempt by Russia would be a sick joke. I think his take of an eventual 'third UKR/RUS war' is contingent on some sort of ceasefire agreement that is ill-defined which somehow allows Russia to rebuild its weaponry. It won't be able to. Russia is too corrupt and unable (under its current regime) to do anything correctly. 1.5 million winter uniforms missing due to corruption. Their only aircraft carrier sitting wounded in its 2nd dry dock (the first one sank) because were repair costs were stolen due to corruption. The Moskva, their flagship of the Black Sea fleet, sunk due to corruption (the leaked readiness report defined how basically nothing worked, yet it was given a green light). The lists go on. 

Russia is corrupt. They are gasping on the fumes of Soviet era weaponry, which has been picked apart by corruption. I can't believe that they'll be in a position to wage war again in 10 years. If they stopped fighting today and pulled out, I still find it hard to believe they could pull of any 'rebuilding' or 'restockpiling'.",False,1665620438.0,t3_y1tjhz,t1_is2zwok,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

If he goes and Medvedev, or someone similar, takes the reins the political gains for the West are relatively small.

The result is predictable....the Kuznetzov has a smell of its own...and that smell is not bunker oil.

Its vulnerable to most IFV's main armaments, to *any* ATGM, practically all ATM's and a whole host of weaponry in plentiful supply for Ukrainian troops. They are going to get turned into scrapmetal at unprecedented speed. Infantry properly shielding a good MBT is horrible to go up against and hard to take out.

[This meme should explain the issue clearly.](https://i.redd.it/iaxceir5tdt91.png)

On paper, Russia had 13,000+ T-72 or newer tanks active and in reserve.  They have lost roughly 2,500 tanks total in Ukraine which should leave them with well over 10,000 tanks they could be using and sending into battle. Its even more ridiculous when you consider the fact that the T-64 isn't included in those numbers.

So why would they be spending time, energy and resources refitting a large number of T-62s (last produced in 1975) for use in Ukraine if they have that many newer tanks in reserve?

The dialogue from the Russian government in the past few days isn't nuclear blackmail; it's textbook deterrence.

Part of that change in dialogue may be the fact that NATO and the US have issued deterring statements of their own; Russia is being deterred at the moment as well. The nuclear blackmail hypothetical (give me Ukraine or I nuke you) isn't deterrence, and I argue we haven't heard such an explicit threat at this point.

I mean, you're contradicting yourself in the same comment.

Yes, the official dialog from the Russian government was one of measured deterrence, and NATO intelligence does suggest that they are not making any moves that contradict that.

But at the same time they are ""toying with compellence"", as you put it, through unofficial channels.

I'm not under any delusion that NATO decision makers are ""compelled"" by those efforts directly in any way, and that isn't the goal of Russia's efforts. The goal is to try and exploit the weakness of NATO's democratic systems and the lack of understanding of the electorate to compell the decision makers indirectly.

Just because they're not threatening and blackmailing the decision makers directly, but rather the people those decision makers are accountable to doesn't mean it's not happening.",False,1665612288.0,t3_y1tjhz,t1_is24drz,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

You seemed to take away that I thought that Russia's compellence was the same as NATO's deterrence. I don't think that's true and I stated as such later on; it is my fault that I wasn't more clear initially. I did contradict myself; you brought up a good point and I changed part of my position to accommodate your insight.,False,1665613290.0,t3_y1tjhz,t1_is2uedf,,9,2,0,2,0,0,
