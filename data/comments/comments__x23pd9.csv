Day 189 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today, I’m pretty sure, we had no shelling, but instead of shelling they just did two missile strikes in one day. The first missile strike was extremely early, they did it at 1:20pm, honestly I don’t even remember the last time they fired their missiles in the middle of the day, they pretty much always fire them in the evening, or at night time. They hit some factory, we don’t know which one, but thankfully nobody was hurt.

Then there was another missile strike in the evening, at 10:30pm, which is still very early for them. They fired 6 missiles in total and as usual one of the missiles bombed Belgorod, because why wouldn’t it. People from Belgorod even filmed it from different angles, they also said that it hit some residential district, because no matter what they aim it at, it will always hit civilians, but Russian don’t even mind it that much.

We don’t know where the missiles that did make it to Kharkiv landed, but they sounded pretty distant. Our mayor and governor didn’t say anything about it either, so it might not have hit anything important, because usually they always say what was hit within hours, even at night. The missile from yesterday actually just barely missed an apartment building, so there could have been a lot more than just 2 injured people. Fuckers intentionally aim at civilians, but then their missiles choose to bomb Belgorod instead.

Ukrainian army units pushing toward Kherson in the south are retaking ground held for months by Russia’s invading troops amid extremely fierce fighting, according to Ukrainian soldiers taking part in the offensive.

Russian soldiers seemed well equipped and were putting up stiff resistance, the Ukrainians said.

“They’re throwing everything against us,” said a 22-year-old Ukrainian soldier who said Russians were fighting with artillery, tanks, helicopters and mortars. “They have a lot of equipment but few men.”

Interviews with eight soldiers who took part in fighting—and were being treated for injuries at a hospital behind the front lines—offered the most detailed on-the-ground picture yet from an offensive that Ukraine hopes will help it seize the initiative in the conflict and show its Western backers, and its own people, that its military can take on Moscow’s army and win.

…

The soldiers and medics at a hospital in southern Ukraine agreed to speak on condition that their identities and location wouldn’t be revealed. All took part in the offensive that began Monday with the aim of seizing the initiative in the war.

The attacks Monday at several points along the front lines came after weeks of softening-up Russian forces with long-range rocket attacks.

Ukraine’s long-awaited thrust in the south is advancing into territory that the Russians occupied in the early days of their invasion, according to soldiers who took part in fighting. But it’s a hard slog against a well-equipped enemy, they said.

Ivan, a 32-year-old private, said his unit’s task was simple: “Go in, f— them up, retake what’s ours.”

He said the offensive started well for his unit, which seized a village from the Russians in the early hours of fighting.

But that same day, Monday, he wound up in hospital with a concussion after a teammate fired a rocket launcher a few steps from where he stood.

“The guys are in a fighting mood,” said Ivan, a former construction worker from southwest Ukraine. “They’re moving forward.”

Some Russian troops are fleeing their positions, he said, abandoning equipment and booby-trapping the bodies of dead comrades they leave behind. Ivan showed footage that he said was sent to him by comrades on the front line, appearing to show dead Russian soldiers on the outskirts of a village that he said was seized by Ukrainian forces on Tuesday.

Ivan said Ukrainian forces had thrust toward Kherson, the regional capital, and were trying to clear villages along the way.

Russian military bloggers who are close to the country’s defense ministry have noted another Ukrainian advance, across the Inhulets River to the northeast of Kherson. The Russian Defense Ministry has described Ukraine’s offensive as a failure.

“We’re advancing in some areas and being battered in others,” said Pavlo, a 22-year-old soldier who was concussed in a battle on Tuesday and says he now hears a sound akin to a broken television in his head.

The head of the intensive-care unit where some of the soldiers were being treated said the military warned him of the offensive a week in advance, spurring hopes of imminent victories.

“But when they started bringing in such a large number of wounded, then, honestly, I felt sorry for them and I started wondering if this was worth doing at such a cost,” said the doctor. “I don’t know. There’s no right answer here.”

Ukrainian officials and military analysts have said that Ukrainian losses, even if the offensive is successful, could be high as they are assaulting an entrenched enemy with significant firepower that can quickly chew up troops.

At the intensive-care unit, six servicemen in comas occupied beds in two adjoining wards separated by a thin wall. In one, doctors were fighting to save the life of a 47-year-old armor crewman badly injured when his tank was hit Tuesday, his chest heaving as surgeons performed a tracheotomy in a bid to restore his breathing.

One Ukrainian soldier lay in his bed clutching the Russian bullet that had just been plucked from his body after traveling through his left shoulder and exiting through his pelvis. He was shot as he lay on the ground seeking cover from a Russian attack in a village.

“We had a feeling that we’d be going into battle, that we were planning something big,” the 30-year-old soldier, Petro, said of the days that preceded the offensive as he struggled to speak under the influence of heavy anesthesia. “We all hope the war ends as soon as possible.”

The doctor said he spends some nights on a small couch in his office after more than half his staff stopped coming to work following a Russian rocket attack on the hospital in August. He said he felt on the verge of a breakdown as he has dealt with more soldiers than at any time since the first weeks of the war.

Faced with the influx, doctors are fighting to save the lives of those in critical condition before sending them on to better-equipped hospitals once they are stable.

The head of the intensive-care unit said that on Monday he took in a 27-year-old soldier with a broken leg, concussion, torn lung and a ruptured liver, stomach, colon and bowel. “Head, chest, limbs, stomach, concussions, they come with all kinds of injuries,” he said. “The effect of an explosion damages everything.”

But among the injured, the doctor said he was most struck by their desire to continue fighting as soon as they are physically able.

Ivan, the 32-year-old private, said his concussion on Monday was his third since he was mobilized at the start of Russia’s invasion, and it was only because his commander ordered him evacuated that he ended up at the hospital.

“I want to get back to our guys,” he said, playing down his injuries despite struggling to hear. “I wanted to return the moment I left.”",False,1661989488.0,t3_x23pd9,t3_x23pd9,,0,84,0,84,0,0,

As an aviation nut, these aircraft will have to be using Russian made engines which are complete and utter shite compared to their western analogs.  Aeroflot will not be able to compete with western airlines using these frames (if they can even get them).  

The TU-214 is a 39 year old design w/ PS-90 engines.

The MC-21 hasn't yet entered service, despite a first flight date of 2017 (tells you how well the flight-test program has gone).  It was originally built with 72% foreign content and they are redesigning to 2%... but still will enter the market on time... okay.. They also have to change the engines to Aviadvigatel PD-14 from Pratt's.  The bypass-ratio (a good indicator of fuel efficiency, yes they are nuances, not writing a thesis on jet engines here) of the new engine is roughly half that of the original planned power plant, which will undoubtedly cut into range on this frame significantly.

The Superjet faces a similar engine challenge and has suffered multiple groundings due to safety issues due to piss poor manufacturing and engineering.  The airframe has also already had 3 hull losses out of \~150 deliveries, a HORRIBLE ratio.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 31 August 2022


- Ukrainian armoured forces have continued to assault Russia's Southern Grouping of Forces on several axes across the south of the country since Monday. Ukrainian formations have pushed the front line back some distance in places, exploiting relatively thinly held Russian defences.

- In line with its doctrine, Russia will likely now attempt to plug the gaps in its line using pre-designated mobile reserve units. These will likely include some of those from the Eastern Grouping of Forces.

- Russia continues to expedite attempts to generate new reinforcements for Ukraine. Volunteer battalions of the new 3rd Army Corps had departed their home base near Moscow by 24 August, highly likely for onward deployment to Ukraine. The operational effectiveness of these units is not known. The 3rd Army Corps is highly likely short of personnel and these troops have had limited training.",False,1661925928.0,t3_x23pd9,t3_x23pd9,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

We're sourcing medical supplies requested by Hospitallers brigade that are hard for orgs on the ground to procure in Europe.  Amazon will ship them to the fundraiser's house and she ships them to Kyiv. [We shipped our first box of bandages on Monday.](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1564341873874857984)

\- We've added new items: Burn Shield bandages and tourniquets, on the request of our contact. These supplies will be given by our contact in Kyiv directly to the Hospitallers medics brigade, when they arrive to his post office in kyiv.

\- We've collected 125 items total, including 15 items that I originally purchased to start things off.  That's a total of $4,293.38 of monetary value so far!

\- The first shipment is in transit, so far in the regional facility in Oakland but we're expecting it will begin its trip to Ukraine in a day or so. After that, based on our experience with a previous shipment, it might take about 2 weeks.

\- Since people's purchases are arriving in no particular order with no particular schedule, the person recieving them is just packing them as they come. As soon as the next box is full we'll ship it.

Thank you so much for supporting this. I honestly didn't think this stupid little idea would take off, but I'm glad it provided people with a way to support, and work to stop this horrible genocide or at least save some lives of innocent people.

Finally, there have been some questions as to the legit-ness of this as the items do seem to be available in Europe. I can't really give you anything other than the above since I'm just an individual on the internet. The issue is the supplies really expensive and hard to procure in bulk or in any significant numbers, and the large organizations on the ground have many other priorities, like getting drones and military equipment. That's the issue I'm trying to solve, on the request of my Ukrainian friends who know the situation on the ground.

However, if you do live in Europe and can procure supplies yourself, or want to contribute money directly to Hospitallers, [you can find all that information on the Hospitallers website.](https://www.hospitallers.life/needs-hospitallers)

Now they don’t even talk to one another, never take off their bulletproof vests and don’t smile at all. Their eyes are empty and dark like dry wells. These fighters lost a third of their personnel, and one of them said that he would rather be dead because now he is afraid to live. I used to think I had seen enough deaths in my life. I served on the front line in the Donbas for almost a year in 2015 and ’16, and I witnessed numerous tragedies. But in those days the scale of losses was completely different, at least where I was. Each death was carefully fixed, investigations were conducted, we knew most of the names of the killed soldiers, and their portraits were published on social networks. This is another kind of war, and the losses are, without exaggeration, catastrophic. We no longer know the names of all the dead: There are dozens of them every day. Ukrainians constantly mourn those lost; there are rows of closed coffins in the central squares of relatively calm cities across the country. Closed coffins are the terrible reality of this cruel, bloody and seemingly endless war.

I, too, have my dead. In the course of the conflict, I’ve learned of the deaths of various friends and acquaintances, people I had worked with or people I’d never met in person but with whom I maintained friendships on social networks. Not all these people were professional soldiers, but many could not help but take up arms when Russia invaded Ukraine.

I read obituaries on Facebook every day. I see familiar names and think that these people should continue writing reports and books, working in scientific institutes, treating animals, teaching students, raising children, baking bread and selling air-conditioners. Instead they go to the front, get wounded, develop severe PTSD and die.

One of the biggest recent blows for me was the death of the journalist Oleksandr Makhov. He already had some military experience, and knowing his fearlessness and courage, I followed him attentively online. I used to visit his Facebook page and was happy to see new posts: They showed he was alive. I focused on his life as if it were a beacon in a stormy sea. But then Oleksandr was killed, and everything fell apart. One by one, I got the news about the deaths of those I knew.

I forbade myself to believe that I and the people I love or like will survive. It is hard to exist in this state, yet accepting the possibility of one’s own death is necessary for every soldier. I started thinking about it back in 2014 when, not yet holding a weapon in my hands, I already sensed that one day I would be able to wield one — and so it proved. In the 10 months I spent on the front line near Popasna, in the Luhansk region, I thought often about death. I could feel its quiet steps and calm breathing next to me. But something told me no, not this time.

Now, who knows? Currently my service takes place on the northern border, where I patrol part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. It is safer here than in the east or south, although the proximity of the autocratic Belarusian leader takes a psychological toll. Our unit’s task is to prevent a repeat of the events of March, when the northern part of the Kyiv region was occupied and the enemy shelled the outskirts of the capital with artillery.

I’m ready to get into any hot spot. There is no fear. There is no silent horror, as there was in the beginning, when my wife and son were hiding in the hallway of our Kyiv apartment trying to somehow calm down or even fall asleep amid the excruciating howling of air alarms and explosions. There is sadness, of course: More than anything in the world, I just want to be with my wife, who is still in Kyiv with my son. I want to live with them, not die somewhere on the front line. But I have accepted the possibility of my death as an almost accomplished fact. Crossing this Rubicon has calmed me down, made me braver, stronger, more balanced. So it must be for those who consciously tread the path of war. The deaths of civilians, especially children, are a completely different matter. And no, I don’t mean that the life of a civilian is more valuable than the life of a military person. But it is a little more difficult to be prepared for the death of an ordinary Ukrainian who was going about her life and was suddenly killed by Russian roulette. It is also impossible to be prepared for brutal tortures, mass graves, mutilated children, bodies buried in the courtyards of apartment buildings, and missile attacks on residential areas, theaters, museums, kindergartens and hospitals.

How to prepare yourself for the thought that the mother of two children who hid in a basement for a month slowly died before their eyes? How to accept the death of a 6-year-old girl who died of dehydration under the ruins of her house? How should we react to the fact that some people in the country, as in occupied Mariupol, are forced to eat pigeons and drink water from puddles at the risk of catching cholera? To quote Kurt Vonnegut, even if wars didn’t keep coming like glaciers, there would still be plain old death. But encounters with death could be very different. We want to believe that we and our beloved ones, the modern people of the 21st century, no longer have to die from medieval barbaric torture, epidemics or detention in concentration camps. That’s part of what we’re fighting for: the right not only to a dignified life but also to a dignified death. Let us, the people of Ukraine, wish ourselves a good death — in our own beds, for example, when the time comes. And not when Russian missiles hit our houses at dawn.

Sometimes the simplest explanation is the obviously correct one.

Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russia, and is in a fairly vulnerable and strategically important location. 

Ukraine has expended major effort preparing for an offensive there, and Russia has expended major effort defending it precisely because Ukraine taking it back would both be a major strategic victory for them and also a huge propaganda blow to russia- it would be clear to the entire world that Ukraine is not just capable of holding the line but actually reversing the major Russian gains. 

By the same token, a failed ukrainian offensive would be a huge disappointment for them and their western backers and leave people wondering how the war is likely to be brought to a successful conclusion.

 So after concentrating on breaking russian supply lines to Kherson for two solid months the idea that Ukraine is keeping substantial forces in reserve so they can yell 'psyche!' and head in a totally different direction is a bit ridiculous. Successful offensives take time and preparation both in terms of wearing down enemy defences and in accumulating the strategic weight of troops and supplies necessary to make and exploit a breakthrough. It's not just a question of everyone hopping on the back of a tank and driving to a particular point on the map.

It's a wonder the Gepards were still available. Their military is also notoriously understocked, barely has enough to fulfill their NATO duties. Germany doesn't have spares of the heavy stuff. What they have, they've already given away to UA, or as a ring trade to backfill other EE countries that then gave UA Soviet stuff.

As for new production, German manufacturers supply half the world, they're maxed out. That's why to give IRIS-T to UA, Germany had to basically seize the first charge already bought by Egypt and reroute it to UA. Ofc they're adding additional capacity but that takes at least a year to have an effect. 

So yeah, I'd say Germany is doing what they can without crippling their military, which they really need to shore up themselves, all when production is already at capacity.

Edit: Germany's entire artillery capability consists of 121 (in 2017) Pzh2000, 185 planned and 38 Mars II (modernized M270). That's it. No other SPGs, no field guns, they have nothing else. MBTs? They have 289 Leo 2A7s, 328 planned, that's it. IFVs: 382 Marder, 350 Puma - that's about what Russia lost the last two months. Their military is lean as hell, way too lean, and uses mostly modern equipment that's costly and takes long to produce. It's a miracle they could be convinced to give away even a handful of Pzh2000s.

Both sides have saturated air defence (closing the skies), which HIMARS and HARM missiles targeted, allowing Ukraine to introduce combined arms.

It also is likely that Russian support casualties are actually very high, and the troops initially committed to the war were majority combat troops, the support troops came in later.

Given the lack of data on wounded troops, Minusrus also assumes a ""Western"" 3:1 ratio of WIA:KIA, which almost certainly inflates the number. Given Russia's lack of battlefield medical ability, it's probably much closer to 1:1.

*Precipitation in Ukraine is quite frequent throughout the year, but it's not abundant in most of the country, since it hovers between 500 and 600 millimeters (20 and 23.5 inches) per year in the vast inland area occupied by plains and hills. The rainiest season is summer because of afternoon thunderstorms. However, winter is not dry, since precipitation in this season is not abundant but it's quite frequent, and often occurs in the form of light snow.*

*In the Black Sea region, precipitation is even scarcer, below 500 mm (20 in) per year, since summer thunderstorms occur more rarely. The only area that is quite rainy is the western one, Galicia (see Lviv), where almost 800 mm (31.5 in) of rain fall per year, and the Carpathian Mountains, where precipitation reaches 1,200 mm (47 in) per year, in addition to the small area of the Crimean Mountains, where it can reach 1,000 mm (40 in).

Even with the A1 series I'm confident that it can take an ATGM and still GTFO unless they nailed the top of the turret or tracked it. Crew survival would most likely nit even be questioned. However Russia is not fond of smart munitions due to production cost and I've yet to see any vehicles sporting a Konkurs or the like.

Also if memory serves the M1A1 has thermals.

Can the M1 die? Of course. To ATGM's? Yeah of course.

But it's extremely damn difficult with a properly trained crew and again boils down to who spots who first in regards to facing a peer nation.

That and also we expect them to not utilize armor how Russia is doing it because sending tanks without infantry in urban warfare is asking for them to be destroyed.

With all of that said, with how they've been utilizing armor right now, the Abrams would be extremely effective.

> You really think the US is going to ship more than 200 hundred gas guzzling Abrams over in less then a month.

Nobody is putting new tanks in Ukrainian service in a month. It will take months to complete the training and get the logistics chain established regardless of which tank it is. Unless it is a T-series. But as for the simply moving them, yes. The US could ship more than 200 tanks from the US to Europe in less than a month. 

As for gas-guzzling. The Abrams gets ~78% the gas millage of the Leopard. It's less fuel efficient, but not outrageously so. Plus it is more versatile. A gas turbine engine, which the Abrams uses, can use jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, and more. Though the efficiency does drop some. Diesel engines, like the Leopard, don't have that flexibility. That doesn't mean diesel wasn't a good choice for the Leopard, but the gas guzzling reputation of the Abrams is more myth than fact. 

>There are more NATO user in Europa with the leopard so it would be a more obvious choice.

If they were modernized AND countries were willing to give them. Which they aren't. 

>The only thing needed is Germany stepping up their game.

Germany isn't capable of producing tanks fast enough to meet Ukraine's needs. Unless this war drags on for a few more years. Seriously they don't have huge tank production lines sitting around ready to go.

>The 2A7 is a far better choice then the Abrams. 

And how many of those exist currently? 

Don't get me wrong. If there were enough modern Leopards available and europe looked like it was willing to equip Ukraine, I'd say go for it. European tanks for a european war. But there aren't enough. And europe isn't willing.

That's the task of the Russian state and they're kind of ruining things for a lot of people, of whom the Russians are the least of my concern.

But yes, maybe then we should work out a formula for known Russian dissidents to come here while banning tourist visa. I'd be open to that. Wherever possible Russians who don't agree with their regime should get the chance to go live somewhere else. But a tourist visa doesn't seem like the best way to organise this, it seems to me.

I really don't see why ordinary Russians, of whom a lot support the war against Ukraine and Western values, should come here for tourism.

No, but Western values have always called for open doors to people fleeing from political persecution. Heck, escapees from Cuba, Iran, North Korea historically have been allowed to resettle, not deported back. 

Right now russian dissidents are caught in the Limbo: at home they face years of jailtime for merely saying ""No to War"", in Europe they are seen as Putin's infiltration army and denied freedom of movement or resettlement. This affects everyone, from those who merely posted anti-government stuff online to those who attended the big protests to opposition journalists and activists to people actively fleeing from charges opened against them. Although they absolutely *are* a minority (no doubt about it!), hundreds of thousands if not millions of russians despise this war but feel like the West betrayed them to putin in time of need.
