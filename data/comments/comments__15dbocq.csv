I’ve been having a bit of a deep dive into the Ukrainian offensive.

The main message is:

KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON 💪

This offensive started in June and has had a couple of phases.

At first - the Ukrainians tried a fairly direct style of assault - perhaps buoyed by all the expectations both internal and external

These initial weeks in June saw the taking of some Russian front line positions, and in some areas a few kilometres of territory - but the main Russian lines were breached and there was perhaps a 5-10% vehicle destruction rate.
(NYT reported 20% but this doesn’t take into account vehicles recovered, repaired and reissued to the troops)
This is broadly what phase 1 looked like. The three blue arrows are where the Ukrainians pushed forward.

L - > R

Orikhiv towards Tokmak (and then Melitopol?)
Velyka Novosilka towards Mariupol
Bahkmut

The blue circle on the left is where Ukraine has established a bridgehead over the River Dnipro south of Kherson. This and the Bahkmut axis should be considered fixing assaults to draw Russian forces away from the main axes which are Tokmak and Velyka Novosilka
The reason Tokmak and Velyka Novosilka are the main axes are shows in this diagram.

Successful assaults in this area get to the coast and will split the Russian forces in two.

The final piece of phase 1 is the red arrow - which is a Russian counteroffensive in the Kupyansk area - the Russians are trying to fix as many Ukrainians as possible up there to take the pressure off the Russian forces in the South.

How can we assess phase 1?
Not bad is the basic judgment. It would have been nicer had it been a bit more successful but in some cases up to 10km of territory was taken back (more than the Russians have taken in the rest of the year by the way), but it came at a cost in men and materiel.
And Ukraine, above all else, is being careful with its people - it cannot afford to lose them, and it certainly can’t afford to throw them willy-nilly against Russian defences that, let’s be honest, were probably much stronger that was assessed before hand.
So Ukraine switched it up. Phase 2.
Here the Ukrainians went back to what they are very good at, but with a twist.
Throughout this war - the Ukrainians have been very good at finding and destroying Russian logistics, and transport nodes (like bridges) that the logistics flow across.
This, more than anything else, led to their successes in forcing a Russian pull out from Kherson - the Russians simply couldn’t supply their forces anymore.
The Ukrainians (aided by western intelligence) have developed a very good system for identifying these targets and then hitting them - particularly with guided rocket artillery, drones, and now cruise missiles (initially supplied by the UK and now other countries)
To the target set of logistics and bridges the Ukrainians added Russian artillery pieces (that’s the twist), and particularly high value ones like rocket artillery.
The Ukrainians have spent the last few weeks going hunting for Russian artillery and logistics.
It’s relatively easy:

1) Ukrainian probing assault
2) See where the Russian artillery comes from
3) Hit the Russian artillery pieces with HIMARs / drones etc.
4) Use communications intelligence / satellites to work out where their logistics are.
5) Hit the logistics
6) Repeat
Rates of Russian artillery losses are now at their highest since the war began.
So what, you think?

Well - the Russians, more than almost anyone else (expect perhaps the North Koreans) practice a very artillery centric type of warfare for both offence and defence.

Take out the artillery and they can’t fight anymore
Look at all these red circles - these are all bridges or transport hubs that have been hit by storm shadow cruise missiles over the last few weeks.

It makes it increasingly difficult for Russian to do anything if they can’t supply their troops.

Now - in the last week or so there has been a flutter of excitement amongst western media outlets that the ‘proper’ counteroffensive was kicking off and that Ukraine was committing its reserve etc.
I don’t really see any evidence of this.

There has been a bit more activity on the Orikhiv axis, and Ukraine has managed to capture the settlement of Staromaiorske (on the Velyka Novosilka axis).

These are hardly big strategic muscle moves.
What I suspect has happened is western capitals were getting a bit jittery about the pace of progress, and Ukraine realised it needed to release some good news.

But really I see the last week as more of the same - phase 2 as described in this thread.
The Ukrainians aren’t going to be rushed in this making them lose more people.

They know they need to show progress before the end of the year.
Last year is a better analogy - all through the summer everyone was saying Ukraine was losing and the Kharkiv and Kherson happened in the Autumn and late Autumn.
The reality is that the scene is being set now. Wait until the Autumn once Russia has run out of artillery and its logistics don’t work.
That’s all for now. Thanks for reading.

Russian aggression has gone bankrupt on the battlefield. Today is already the five hundred and twenty-second day of the so-called ""special military operation,"" which the Russian leadership expected to last for a week or two. Ukraine is getting stronger. Gradually, the war is returning to Russia's territory – to its symbolic centers and military bases, and this is an inevitable natural and fair process. But we must be aware that, just like last year, Russian terrorists can still attack our energy sector and critical facilities this winter. Today we discussed with the communities the current state of preparation for all possible scenarios.

**What does the data show?**  
In short, Ukraine controls 80.5% of her core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22 2022, and up from 80.3% six weeks ago (equating to 400 square miles recaptured). Prior to last year's invasion, control was at 90.9%.

Since the Ukrainian counter-offensive began in early June, some 550 square miles have been retaken. In 2023, Russian forces have lost approximately 850 square miles of territory on net, despite some localised gains and the costly offensive in the Bakhmut direction. In 2023, at least 34,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Approximately 14,000 Ukrainian soldiers have also been killed in the same time.

🔴 Russia total KIAs are an estimated 73,400 (± 7,300), with a 30-day average of 140 KIA per day, down from 160 KIA per day last month.

🟡 Ukrainian total KIAs are an estimated 28,700 (± 1,400), with a 30-day average of 110 KIA per day, up from 80 KIA per day last month.

Note: this territorial analysis and estimates of KIA both rely only on publicly available data and should be taken only as illustrating long-term trends, not as scientific data points. These numbers are retrospectively revised as new, more trusted, estimates or maps emerge.

>
>In this virtual world, players have adopted the letter Z, a symbol of the Russian troops who invaded last year; embraced legally specious Russian territorial claims in Crimea and other places; and echoed President Vladimir V. Putin’s efforts to denigrate Ukrainians as Nazis and blame the West for the conflict.
>
>“Glory to Russia,” declared a video tutorial on how to construct a flagpole with a Russian flag on Minecraft. It showed a Russian flag over a cityscape labeled Luhansk, one of the Ukrainian provinces that Russia has illegally annexed.

Moscow has therefore not only pulled out of the grain deal that had enabled Ukrainian agricultural exports via the Black Sea, it has also launched massive air strikes against Ukrainian ports to destroy any possibility of reviving the agreement. The same logic underpins Russia’s air strikes against civilian infrastructure: they are aimed at making Ukrainian cities uninhabitable and preventing reconstruction efforts.

It's about where the Russians can safely place their ammunition and fuel depots, barracks, repair yards, storage facilities, etc. Ukraine having longer-range, more accurate weaponry directly equates to the Russians being forced to push their logistics hubs further and further away from the front if they want to actually make use of those supplies.

That said, there's some places in Crimea that cannot be reliably hit by Storm Shadow because it's air-launched and that complicates deployment (both due to being launched from Soviet-era planes and the generally hazardous aerial environment in Ukraine). Taurus can (potentially) be launched from further away and thus more easily used to blow up Russian shit alongside Storm Shadow.

Knocking out the Crimean bridges is obviously hugely beneficial, but Russia having an even harder time keeping their conveniently reckless smokers from destroying yet another ammo dump is also massively beneficial.

Worth noting that these polls this far in advance usually don't mean jack shit. He's the growing favorite for GOP, but even some polls have said he's favorites above Biden. I don't see it. In 2016 I could see personally, just by observing people and conversations around me (yes, this is a local sample, and biased to my circle) the support Trump had that wasn't being reflected in polls. In 2020, it seemed to be pretty evenly split. Now? I see way way less support for Trump, I mean by a large magnitude -- I used to see endless Trump flags and bumper stickers every single day. Now I'm lucky to see one redneck with a Trump sign on their car in a week.

Outside of the South, I don't think he's gained anything and likely lost / turned off many near-center voters.

It'll be interesting to see how the GOP race starts to shape up once contestants start to drop out.

In Western doctrine the idea of a front is like ""The Western Front"" from WWI and denotes a theater of operations usually with a defined battle line in contact with the enemy.

In Soviet parlance ""Front"" was a combat formation, usually what English, American, French, or German military theorists would consider an Army or an Army Group.

So the translations probably deliberately avoid the idea of a ""front"" because it exists in both languages with different meanings.  Even though that is the best English language translation.

When government contracts change hands what happens generally is the same employees mostly shift to the new company that gets the contract.  If a company took those contracts from SpaceX then a good chunk of the employees would end up hired by the new company and Elon would cry on his shitty blog site.",1690698287.0,1690697790.0,t3_15dbocq,t1_ju1iitl,,2,11,0,11,0,0,

Mine just happens to be the one I subscribe to.

That said, here are just a couple major differences that demonstrate the difference between those conflicts and this one:

* An imperialistic war (trying to gain territory / annex land)
* A genocidal effort
* Focus on terrorizing the populace / civilians
* Bombing of civilian buildings seen as a good thing
* Coordinated efforts to kidnap children / forced Russification
* No criticism of the war ""SMO"" allowed

But, for the sake of your curiosity (I *really* wanted to put that word in quotes, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt), I was not surprised (and continue to be unsurprised) that Islamic terrorists target America.

Tying down a million of Hitler's troops in air defense, one way or another, effectively a second front in Europe even before the invasions of Sicily and Italy.

Forcing the Luftwaffe to commit large numbers of fight aircraft and pilots to challenging the bomber formations, wearing them down to such an extent that very few German planes were even spotted in the skies over the Normany beachhead.

Establishing not merely air superiority, but air supremacy for the Allies in the battle for France, the value of which was demonstrated by the St. Lo breakout and the destruction of locomotives relied upon by the German supply chain.

Diverting thousands of 88mm antiaircraft guns, which could otherwise be employed in the antitank role, firing Flak shells almost uselessly into the sky. Expending around 16,000 such shells, more than enough to wear out the barrel, for a single bomber destroyed.

Breaking the will of a nation to continue fighting, with an air campaign, is not impossible. But it looks like total war. The devastation rained down on Japanese cities in LeMay's firebombing raids, for example. Which along with the US Navy's blockade of the home islands, would have forced a capitulation by the end of 1945, according to even the Army Air Force's postwar assessment, with or without the subsequent nuclear attacks.

It is questionable whether this is even possible, with conventional weapons, against a modern country without the unique circumstances of wartime Imperial Japan. The type of construction used in their cities, the difficulty of transportation of goods, at that time and place, without unfettered shipping by sea.

Similarly, destroying the ability of a nation to continue to challenge an invading army's freedom of movement, or even their ability to maintain order, if not to eradicate all resistance, is not impossible. But it takes an air campaign as coordinated as that of the coalition forces in Operation Desert Storm, or much later, that which preceded the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Or, one as coordinated as that which Putin's actions will ultimately force NATO to conduct against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, and on a more limited scale, against Russian forces just across the border from whatever alliance member country he chooses to attack.

It clashes with their own means of locating and communicating, and can cause confusion, and extreme anxiety.

mating processes get disrupted,

 some stranded whales have shown signs of decompression sickness, 

and the Cayman islands noticed changes in whale behavior before VS after a ban on sonar usage.

For what it's worth, both the US Navy and the Supreme Court claimed that Sonar was causing behavioral issues, not direct physical harm, but that's like the Navy investigating the Navy's actions, and is a matter of degrees.

Even if Ukraine takes back all it's territory that doesn't mean the war will end. Russia could still keep going if people is willing to do so.

With my hatred of loud noises, it was bad enough to read, never mind experiencing.


The good news is that research papers are beginning to appear, on the functions of ambient ocean noise, and whether it is possible to adapt to the ocean's natural frequencies in order to map the sea floor while doing less damage.

This is still pretty out there, and I'm having to go straight to academic bulletins, but I wanted to say something positive.

This also calls for further study in areas of shallow water, so wondering about post-war usage of the Black Sea, to tie back into the subject of Ukraine.

You: ""Several northern states had large slave populations""

At the outbreak of the Civil War, ONE NORTHERN state had less than 50 slaves.

The federal government did not declare war over slavery. When the CONFEDERACY was declared, the UNION of states that did not secede was made up of the Northern states and three southern states. They did not secede for a number of reasons. Maryland's was its unfortunate location between DC and Pennsylvania, but these were three Southern states kept in in the Union, largely by proximity and force.

The US did not declare war over slavery because they were trying to bring the secession states back into the Union.

The Confederacy seceded because the Northern states were eventually going to abolish slavery at a federal level. Lincoln's victory in 1860 signaled that they would no longer be able to affect change at the ballot box, so they seceded to no longer be subject to the Northern-dominated legislature. 

The Confederacy was declared to preserve slavery. The Union fought to bring them back into the Federal government.

""the US would not have used slavery as an immediate cause to fight the civil war as several of its members were slave holding states"" is nonsense bullshit, mostly touted by racists that want to reframe the Civil War as ""a struggle for states' rights"" and Chomsky-lite tankies that are useful idiots for the racists.",False,1690739813.0,t3_15dbocq,t1_ju3gxtz,,2,1,0,1,0,0,
