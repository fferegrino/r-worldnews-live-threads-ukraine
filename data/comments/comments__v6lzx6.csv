European Council President Charles Michel has accused Russia of using food supplies as ‚Äúa stealth missile against developing countries‚Äù and blamed the Kremlin for a looming global food crisis, prompting Moscow‚Äôs UN ambassador to walk out of a Security Council meeting.

Michel addressed Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia directly at a council meeting, saying he saw millions of tonnes of grain and wheat stuck in containers and ships at the Ukrainian port of Odesa a few weeks ago ‚Äúbecause of Russian warships in the Black Sea‚Äù.

He said Moscow‚Äôs attacks on Ukraine‚Äôs transport infrastructure and grain storage facilities, as well as its tanks, aerial bombings and mines, are preventing Ukraine from planting and harvesting.

‚ÄúThis is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty and destabilising entire regions,‚Äù Michel said. ‚ÄúRussia is solely responsible for this looming food crisis.‚Äù",False,1654584920.0,t3_v6lzx6,t3_v6lzx6,,0,129,0,129,0,0,

Day 104 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling was really bad yet again; at least 1 person was killed by it, but most likely more and around 6 more people were injured. Waking up from the sound of explosions is definitely not fun, especially when they are nearby. There was some shelling in the morning, then during the day, and last one was around 10-11pm. And during the shelling in the evening, people in Kharkiv oblast were seeing battlefield illumination again; they are using it almost every day now.

Shelling that happened at 10-11pm was the worst one today, explosions were reported in pretty much every single district of the city, and at least one fire started from it. It was really bad in my district as well, it was extremely loud here, and my apartment building was shaking a bit, not nearly as much as during the first weeks, when shelling was much worse, but it is still pretty bad. 

Judging by the sound some shells were landing within a couple hundred meters from my home at most, those are pretty dangerous, even if they don‚Äôt hit the building head on, their shockwave can shatter windows and send shards flying everywhere. Thankfully taping the windows is actually very effective, even when the glass shatters the tape holds the shards together very well. It doesn‚Äôt stop the windows themselves from breaking, but it stops the shards from flying too far.",False,1654652227.0,t3_v6lzx6,t3_v6lzx6,,0,123,0,123,0,0,

Russia will be unable to sustain its military capabilities due to tough Western sanctions, German Chancellor¬†Olaf Scholz¬†said Tuesday.

Western countries have hit Russia with¬†a swathe of sanctions¬†since its invasion of the Ukraine, with Scholz asserting that the ""very effective, very-far reaching"" injunctions would set the Russian economy back ""by decades.""

Scholz added that even if Russia abused imports of civilian goods for military purposes, Moscow will also not be able to retain its military capabilities the same way due to the sanctions.

In his first visit to a NATO country that borders Russia, the Chancellor also joined leaders from Estonia and Latvia in promising to strengthen NATO's eastern flank by pledging to bolster Germany's military support to Lithuania.

Russia is coming under increasing fire for its role in fueling a growing global food crisis.

Speaking at the United Nations Security Council on Monday, European Council President Charles Michel accused the Kremlin of ""using food supplies as a stealth missile against developing countries,"" by holding millions of tons of Ukrainian grain hostage and blockading Ukraine's ports.

‚ÄúThe dramatic consequences of Russia's war are spilling over across the globe. And this is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty and destabilising entire regions. Russia is solely responsible for this food crisis, Russia alone,‚Äù Michel said in his speech at the UN headquarters in New York. 
The European Council chief refuted Russia's claims that Western sanctions were to blame for the food crisis, calling the narrative ""disinformation"" and saying that the EU had no sanctions on the agricultural sector in Russia. ‚ÄúEven our sanctions on the Russian transport sector do not go beyond our EU borders,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey do not prevent Russian-flagged vessels from carrying grain, food or fertilizers to developing countries.‚Äù 

Michel's remarks, at a Security Council meeting convened primarily to discuss sexual violence and other alleged atrocities carried out by Russian forces in Ukraine, underlines the concerns in Brussels about the Kremlin's false narrative on the food crisis.

‚ÄúThe Kremlin is also targeting grain storage and stealing grain in Ukraine while shifting the blame on others. This is cowardly. This is pure and simple propaganda. Let's get to the facts,‚Äù Michel said. 

The comments prompted Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, to storm out of the meeting, to which Michel responded: ""You may leave the room, maybe it's easier not to listen to the truth Mr. Ambassador.""

Since launching its invasion of Ukraine in late February, Russia has upended food production and distribution from the country, known to the world as Europe's breadbasket. A months-long barricade of key ports -- including Mariupol on the Sea of Azov and Odesa on the Black Sea -- have left more than 20 million tons of grain stuck inside Ukraine.

In May, satellite images of the Crimean port of Sevastopol appeared to show bulk carrier ships with Russian insignia docking and loading up what is believed to be stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, on Monday condemned a Russian missile strike that demolished a big grain storage terminal in the southern port city of Mykolaiv over the weekend.",False,1654604558.0,t3_v6lzx6,t3_v6lzx6,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

(...)

*That second-fiddle role is not a scenario Putin would have envisioned when the Russian president decided to invade Ukraine in February, propelled by a desire to rebuild a bygone glory for his nation.*  
  
*But all in all, he should have seen it coming. China is a country obsessed by correcting historical humiliations and retaining its position of global leadership. The time when the Soviet Union was ideologically ‚Äî and economically ‚Äî superior to Communist China is long gone. Huawei Technologies builds Russia‚Äôs 5G networks, while Russia requires Chinese cooperation on everything from aircraft parts to currency swaps. Importantly, it‚Äôs also not just the U.S. and Europe imposing sanctions on Moscow, but also three other major Asian economies: Japan, South Korea and Singapore.*  
  
*Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Kremlin-backed Russian International Affairs Council, doubts that Russia‚Äôs elites have much appetite to serve as China‚Äôs junior partner. But he sees few alternatives for Moscow. ‚ÄúSince the conflict began, Russia started needing China more than earlier because China remains in many ways the only game in town, with economic ties between Russia and the West curtailed and with sanctions imposed on Russia.‚Äù*

‚ÄúRussian forces additionally redeployed troops east of Bakhmut to renew offensives to secure access to highways northeast of Bakhmut and threaten Ukrainian lines of communication,‚Äù the institute said, adding that Russian troops would likely seek to advance toward Slovyansk and Kramatorsk from positions north of the city.

The ISW added that Russian forces were reportedly deploying away from the Zaporizhia region towards Kherson, likely to support defensive positions that have been threatened by Ukrainian counterattacks along the Mykolaiv-Kherson region border.

*Russia has failed to achieve most of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor military planning, significant logistical problems, low combat readiness, and other deficiencies, which undermined Russian military effectiveness. These and other challenges‚Äîincluding Ukrainian military efforts and Western aid‚Äîseverely impacted Russian air, ground, cyber, and maritime operations. Russia‚Äôs failures will force the Russian military to fundamentally rethink its training practices, organizational structure, culture, logistics, recruitment and retention policies, and planning efforts.

)

I'll further will explain why this is relevant on the world stage and Ukraine:

- Giuliani (Trump's lawyer) gave an interview at start of conflict, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius."" ([Yet Fox News ignores this](https://youtu.be/dZf-UJdArzw))

- [Observe Sean Hannity praising Putin's manliness while denigrating Obama for wearing a bicycle helmet while, dare I say it, riding a bicycle](https://youtu.be/timvZTKr5HQ)

- [Kremlin memos urged Russian media to use Tucker Carlson clips](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/14/kremlin-memos-russian-media-tucker-carlson-fox-news-mother-jones)

- [Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Putin just before the invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyUdXaFmwuU)

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO (more on this).

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data (""Russia, if you're listening..."").

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow (On July 4th) and met with their government officials in a closed-door meeting.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

- for Russia the overall strategy is to reduce ground combat to absolute minimum and force this into a artillery war where they will likely have an advantage to the day this war ends. Russia has an advantage in equipment and firepower but has issues with manpower.

- For Ukraine this is the opposite. Maximize ground combat, stay close contact with the enemy, make any territorial gain by Russia take as long as possible. Ukraine has the long term advantage of manpower and higher casualties in war are on their side long term.


The general pattern of this war is now pretty much the same in everywhere. Russia's artillery works on a Ukrainian position for a day or two, followed by a probing attack. Ukrainians inflict damage on that probing attack but also reveal their positions. Repeat until Ukrainians run out of fortified positions in the area or suffer too many casualties and retreat to next position. Overall this is snail pace and gives plenty of opportunity for Ukrainians to find and target Russia's equipment with artillery of their own, showing the downside of Russia's strategy.


In Severodonetsk (and some other areas) there is also an issue of ""gray zones"" and misinterpretation of them. There are so many bullshit claims from there but using the few that are somewhat reliable (on ground journalist and governor) I think the situation went something like this:

1) Russia enters the city with huge overwhelming force, Ukrainians for sure tried to fight back since close combat is what they want but were forced to retreat to western industrial sector which is easier to defend with smaller number. 

2) Russia did not initiate a ground assault on that area, falling back to their usual strategy as they feared casualties.

3) As Russia's pace slowed down Ukraine brought some reinforcements. Evidently composing of people who want guaranteed action. It has been common criticism of foreign legioners that the war is artillery war and they don't get any ""action"". This is the only palce where action is guaranteed.

4) Ukraine did local counter attacks in some directions which for sure confused the Russians.

5) Russia ordered a mass retreat of forward positions to other half of city to not get dragged into ground combat, this included areas where there was no fighting.

6) About 20-30% of the city was now in gray zone, not controlled by anyone.

7) Once distance between troops was achieved Russia again went back to usual strategy and unleashed the artillery barrage, forcing Ukrainian troops back to defensible positions in mainly the industrial area.


Maybe something wrong but this is the overall picture in my opinion, supported by fact that neither side outside likely propaganda is claiming any major losses for either side. Basically we are back where we were a week ago. For future, I anticipate more bullshit claims and more confusion but the long term issue of Ukrainian supply lines being long and dangerous to there remains, meaning this city will sooner or later fall.",False,1654581117.0,t3_v6lzx6,t3_v6lzx6,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

> The nature of urban combat in Severodonetsk is likely obfuscating reports of control of terrain within the city, though Russian forces likely retain control over much of the city. Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhiy Haidai claimed on June 5 that Ukrainian forces managed to retake large parts of Severodonetsk and push Russian forces to the outskirts of the city during successful urban counterattacks. Ukrainian journalist Yuri Butusov, however, denied Haidai‚Äôs claims on June 5 and claimed that Ukrainian forces only control the Azot industrial sector of Severodonetsk. Haidai amended his claims on June 6 and reported that the situation in Severodonetsk has deteriorated significantly, adding that Ukrainian forces were indeed fighting within the Azot industrial site on June 6. The reason for Haidai and Butusov‚Äôs conflicting reports is unclear, and heavy urban fighting is ongoing in the city.

The rest of the world could have become less dependent on natural gas for electricity so there'd be more to make fertilizer from.  Or transition to farming methods that don't rely so much on fertilizer, to the extent that's possible.  The rest of the world's lack of long term planning at least isn't Russia's fault.

The bigger issue from history is if you humiliate all of Russia at the same time, like what happened with post WWI Germany.  If they nurse resentment then it will cause longer-term problems because it will enable new leaders with a strong anti-west attitudes to take control.

What we really need in Russia is a political collapse and a resulting regime change and a complete change in attitude (like we were initially getting in the post-Soviet but pre-Putin days).  This kind of change is hard because you need to deprogram an entire culture from the decades of propaganda they are steeped in.  This was easier to do after WWII because countries like Germany and Japan were so shocked (Germany by the utter destruction, Japan by the nukes and surrender by their Emperor) and so their societies could be rebuilt but in a different way.  Russia will likely lose this war but not be shocked/devastated in the same way, and I see a lot of those post-WWI Germany parallels (they lost the war but the country did not really feel defeated, and the humiliating terms placed on them laid the groundwork for the Nazis and WWII.)

It‚Äôs not like Russia will actually agree to a ceasefire unless they‚Äôre about to completely collapse and by then it will be too late.

While this may seem stupid many parts of the world don‚Äôt really care about the conflict outside of how it affects them. Russia is already trying to create an artificial grain shortage, hoping it will be blamed on Europe and the US as they‚Äôve been supplying Ukraine throughout the war.

 It seems like after Bucha all somewhat sincere attempts at reaching a diplomatic solution stopped.

The helmet is likely not the unmanly feature; that, more likely, is the bicycle itself. American men are expected to own and drive cars; the bicycle, which is a normal mode of transport in more developed countries, is seen as a child's toy, and the qualification to drive a car is considered a major rite of passage and mark of adult status. For an adult American man to ride a bicycle is an indicator of low status - he is either too poor to afford a car or too incompetent to pass the tests to drive one, or else he has been found driving drunk too many times and has been disqualified. [It's humiliating](https://frinkiac.com/gif/S04E16/598063/601817.gif). If he is clearly _not_ low status (for example, if his lightweight carbon frame clearly costs more than your car and his cobweb-thin lycra kit probably also cost more than your best suit) then it indicates that the cyclist does not even believe in these status signals and instead subscribes to some entirely different value system, which is worse still and paints him as downright un-American, certainly liberal and probably queer. For the _president_ to ride a bicycle makes the whole of America seem unmanly in this way, which is all the more outrageous.

No, no - for American men like Mr Hannity you need a president who performs a great show of being very successful in life, to reflect how successful the country is. And driving around in a big expensive car is the very first thing he must do! That's how you show you're a big shot. And that's why it's important that the government should do all they can to keep the price of motor fuel low - otherwise many people might switch away from motoring and take public transport or ride bicycles, and they would feel emasculated.",1654621184.0,1654620775.0,t3_v6lzx6,t1_ibhxhw1,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

From what I've read ( which admittedly could be wrong), they initially entered with a fairly small force ( in the ""hundreds"" supposedly ). The reason they managed to progress fast, was because the Ukrainian forces decided on a controlled retreat to more secure positions.

Most likely, yeah

Artillery needs to be ""walked in,"" they aren't precision weapons (excluding the GPS guided shells). 

So you set up, fire. Either a spotter or a drone operator says ""aim 200 m west"" you re-aim, fire again, it gets corrected, and so on until you are hitting your target. And it is an empty field now but who knows what was in the field when it was being shelled",False,1654629387.0,t3_v6lzx6,t1_ibibmd7,,2,3,0,3,0,0,
bbef3ef31c11db0067b14978965297d4,v6lzx6,ibj90vp,"That's just Russian artillery doctrine for you.   They've never made the effort to maintain a serious group of artillery specialists in their army, since due to conscription and no non-commissioned officer structure, they're just as liable to lose a trained artilleryman as they are to keep one.   So a precise, well-working team isn't in the cards for them.

So instead, they train a bunch of conscripts on what is the pointy end of their artillery piece, how to crank the tube up and down, and (mostly) not blow themselves up firing the howitzer.   Then they send out a huge number of them, and rather than try and hit specific targets, they all lob shells at a general area until it's deemed sufficiently bombed in order for them to advance.

It makes up for the lack of precision to a degree, but introduces a whole shovelload of other problems.   For one, you can't guarantee that a target that your troops needed you to hit will get shelled, so forget trying to hit that tank sitting in cover that's shooting up your BTG as you're trying to advance.   Second, when you're lobbing shells like that, the chances of you hitting your own troops with friendly fire go up dramatically.   

That leads us to the  doctrine.   The Russians will start off with a shaping operation' on the target - or more accurately, the target area - by just dropping a ton of shells over a specific area for a specific time.   So basically, they kind of guess.   X number of shells over Y period of time will result in Z% chance we hit something important.   Once the shelling stops, you send your forces forward, now that you know you're not going to get hit by your own guys.   As the ground forces advance, they're supposed to overwhelm and finish off the opponent to give your artillery a chance to advance and set up for the next volume barrage.  The artillery might try the precision strike role from time to time, but they're not equipped or particularly trained in it, unlike a NATO-style army.  They're going to be even less keen when the Ukrainians and Russians engage up close (i.e., an urban street-fight environment), because they're just as likely to hit their own troops as they are the enemy.

The Ukrainians know how this works - they've been using that approach  until a decade ago.  They know that when the offensive push pauses, you pull back or take cover, because that's the artillery barrage coming.  Once that stop of bombardment hits, you start defending again, because you know that's what's coming next.  Rinse, repeat.",False,1654636698.0,t3_v6lzx6,t1_ibibmd7,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

That means a 50% chance to hit within 200 meters, a 68% chance to hit within 400 meters, and a 95% chance to hit within 600 meters.

This matches up with ""danger close"" being within 600 meters of the target for US Army personnel. The artillery gun isn't aiming at you, but a problem (the charge not going off quite right) could cause a shell to land 600-meters short. And even if everything goes right, you're gonna be +/- 200 meters in any case.

--------------

If USA's accurate guns have that kind of variance, can you imagine how bad the poorly-maintained Russian guns are?

------

It should be noted that an artillery shell is so powerful, that it only needs to be within 50m of a soldier to kill them. Its a big explosion.

Yes, it is true that much of the Russian military invasion forces was clearly caught flat footed, unprepared for intense active combat.

Indeed. We've been some activity coming out of the Putin regime. Lots of high profile people dying mysteriously, one of his bodyguards promoted to a cabinet position, leadership of the FSB being imprisoned, generals being demoted. These are not signs of a stable regime that is in control, and this is just what we can can see from the outside. 

It stands to reason that Putin's position is not at all secure, and that he's currently engaged in a struggle for political (and actual) survival. He may certainly win that struggle, but things are not going remotely as planned for him. 

People talk about the ability of the west to stay united and focused on this war, but the same applies to Russia. It's being strangled by sanctions that are only now starting to really take hold, it's losing the information war, even India/China are (currently) hesitant to help, it will be faced with more and more dead and wounded as the struggle continues. If Ukraine manage to retake a city like Kherson or Melitopol, or even turn the tide at Sieveredonetsk, it's going to be hard for Russian propaganda to project an image of strength and victory. Every day that this war lasts is not a good one for Russia, unless they score some major victories, which seems unlikely at the moment.

Ukrainian food exports aren't just solidly off the market with no hope of leaving. It is in the interest of a lot of the world that much of it's grain goes to market (infact billions of dollars could be made from it).

The artillery sent by the west so far has total numbers around 10 to 20% of Ukraine's artillery at war start.  It is better artillery.  I believe ""better"" is firmly established.  However, the multiplier effect of that improvement has not been established.  This is a particular area where emotional statements from soldiers is misleading.  A slight reduction in Ukraine's losses means a front line soldier has a close friend who is alive instead of dead.  A marginal but measurable advantage gets enthusiastic revues.  Plus Ukraine was running out of Warsaw Pact ammunition.  Soldiers always prefer having ammo to not having ammo.

Testing things on people is never ethical.  As hypothetical thought experiment suppose that instead of just giving a Ukrainian division M777s we removed 2 of the 152mm systems.  How 'bout removing 5?  There must be a point where enthusiastic appreciation transitions toward WTF.  

It is not an insult to M777 though many on Reddit take it that way.  USA makes choices for extreme quality.  US Marines always have all the firepower they can transport.  Sending 2 cannons means a whole second supply line of ships, aircraft, and base support.  It gets crazy if you then add more cannons to defend more staging areas.

I exaggerated a bit. There was of course military elements to it. From the mass bombing of military installations to over-zealous air drops to convoys rushing to take ground but there was also tons of troops who didn't know what was going on and was just ordered to walk in. It wasn't one nation invading the other to decapitate them militarily but a rush and show off force hoping to get the flight and not fight response.

Again, to me this seems like they really wanted the operation to have as little fighting as possible. A bit like the [Warsaw pact invasion of Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia). 

>As the operation at the airport continued, columns of tanks and motorized rifle troops headed toward Prague and other major centers, meeting almost no resistance. Despite the fact that the Czechoslovak People's Army was one of the most advanced militaries in Eastern Europe, it failed to effectively resist the invasion due to its lack of an independent chain of command and the government's fears that it would side with the invaders as the Hungarian People's Army did during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The Czechoslovak People's Army was utterly defeated by the Warsaw Pact armies.

Now you are right. It's hard to know how much was incompetence and how much was intentional.

1. Russian is increasingly losing manpower it cannot replace. They refuse to do mobilization, so instead cannibalize anything that wasn't already in the offensive, and which doesn't have ""a cost"" (for example, they'll pull from active servicemen in the interior, and mobilize people from within Donetsk and Luhansk ""Independent Republics""). These replacements stopped coming in a while ago at a sustainable rate. Replacements that would meaningfully impact anything, that is. They need more men, but they also need more men who won't immediately fall flat on their face.
2. Ukraine is increasingly getting more and more men mobilized; it's about finished now. We're talking something like over 500,000 rotatable troops vs Russia's less than 200,000 (while on the offensive).
3. While Ukraine nonetheless faces challenges equipping and training these men, they can rotate these people in and out as needed. And general impressions from analysts is that this is the case. All while the west continues to provide a flow of weapons and ammunition.
4. Ever since Russia started downgrading their offensive objectives, has corresponded with their manpower shortages.
5. The only way to replace these now is with the six-month conscription cycles which they've only announced in April. It's currently June.

Because of this, the offensive for Severedonetsk is effectively their last, major, Summer offensive that might be able to achieve the objective set out for them, and that objective...is this one city.

Putin's gambled that his reckless disregard for life would net him that land route to Crimea, and proven that he cares less for losses in manpower than he does for gains in territory.

Ukraine values their people, and won't waste them needlessly. Putin doesn't give Fuck One about who dies, as long as he gets that land route.

Both of those are big problems- without fragmentation, you need comparatively larger blasts to get the same damage levels. Without enough atmospheric oxygen, you couldn't detonate the weapon at all, so underwater torpedoes and bunker-busters can't use it.

And I take in a pretty wide amount.

Severedonetsk is not a small battle. Russia has a god-awful lot of BTGs there, attacking a city, that is at the tip of a *salient.*

[This is their manpower situation basically as of today.](https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/not-built-for-purpose-the-russian-militarys-ill-fated-force-design/) It's pretty bad for them, given the conditions they've limited themselves to. And all indications seem to be that they can no longer afford to just lose a bunch of guys and then replace them like nothing happened anymore.

Here's the thing...

...

This entire Severedonetsk affair should have been a layup for them. Encircle the city, cut off Ukrainian blood flow to the area, and secure the city like they did with Mariupol...maybe be a little smarter and just starve them out long term.

If they can't do that while putting all their back muscle into it without straight up giving up the other fronts (they transferred a lot of Kherson troops...Ukraine noticed, and did a counteroffensive at Kherson)...that's not the sign of a military force that's capable of continuing large-scale offensives without another reduction in their territorial aims.

I'm talking reductions like actually ceding Kherson to free up troops for Donbass, or the reverse of that.

The force concentration they're putting forward is the force concentration they were previously trying to use for the Donbass in general, then for Donetsk in general, and now just for this city.

I am on mobile so excuse possible typo's.

So, like minded faschist elected to the presidency points (imo) to a societal failure in the USA, and also to a glaring problem with the current practically two party system in US politics.

Now both of those are known problems in the USA, even if they aren't completely understood or even at a point where effective changes happen where they can be dealt with. I believe strongly that many other democratic candidates would have beaten Trump at the polls. Yes he had a strong voter base, who may not have agreed with _what he represented_ but who agreed with _enough of the lies he told_ to support him over Hillary, but many people voted for him because Hillary/her politics/another Clinton in Office/etc alienated them.

Why I believe ""Russian Agent"" is worse, is because this lumps all of what I said above into a mixing bowl of: 

* Russian influence in US Politics
* Russia outmaneuvering the entirety of the US security and intelligence apparatus
* Russian real time insight into the highest level of the most powerful nation in the world
* Russian access to what the USA knew about the rest of the world

And the damage of Russian access and control over the US presidency did not end with Trump losing the election. The impact of their digging their crooked talons into the machinations of the US government may cast a long shadow still.

What is remarkable to me though, is that if Trump was indeed a russian asset along with the insight it gave Russia, how did they fuck up so badly in their estimation of how they would do and how the world would react to them invading Ukraine?

Surely someone in the Kremlim texted Trump ""Komrade, what say pentagon about Russia invadink Ukraine? You think is good idea? Ples respond quik have briefing with Vlad in hour. TX bye. PS, tell Milanja my daughter think she's total babe and looking forward to barbiedoll teatime next time your here.""
