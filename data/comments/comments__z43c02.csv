During nine months of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has spent $82 billion on war, which is a quarter of its annual budget, according to Forbes.

Forbes calculated that Russia used 10,000 to 50,000 shells per day in the war, and the average price of a Soviet-caliber shell is about $1,000. It brings Russia's spending to more than $5.5 billion on artillery supplies alone.

Day 275 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, but some missile strikes did happen. At around 5:10pm missile launches were spotted in Belgorod, soon after explosions were reported, and I’m pretty sure we even heard one, but they were pretty far away. Then a little later it was reported that Russians aimed at Chuhuiv with S-300 missiles yet again, thankfully there were no casualties. They hit that town very often; I’m not sure why they are so fixated on it. 

We still continue to have some trouble with electricity here in Kharkiv. Parts of my district, including my apartment building, had no electricity for about 5 hours, from 2pm to 6:30-6:40pm, but many other buildings, including most stores/supermarkets had electricity the entire time. It wasn’t as bad as the previous blackout because we still had running water, so that’s at least something.
 
Our friends that are currently living in Ivano-Frankivsk said to us in the morning that they still had no electricity or internet, though we’re not sure if by that they meant over 2 whole days of blackout, or that it was a new blackout after the previous one was fixed, but it sucks either way.

It seems that Kherson is getting shelled a lot recently and sadly there are a lot of civilian casualties. Just today the official numbers were 15 dead and 35 injured civilians after the most recent shelling. Those are the same numbers of civilian casualties we were having in Kharkiv when we were being shelled 50-100 times per day, and now it’s happening in Kherson as well, fucking Russian bastards.

Then, that night, he returned with his sister.

Being children, they could fit underneath the floor in the crawl space.  He managed to drill up, through the floor, and through the bottom of one of the wooden barrels that contained flower. His sister had a large bowl that they filled with the flower.

He also thought ahead and brought a cork with him.  When the bowl was filled, he corked the hole.

If you look at the beginning of the video you will see other Russian positions in the woods and a bunker on the road. 

They are Russian positions because you can see the remnants of a lot of Russian MRE kits (meals ready to eat) meaning this is a static position that has been there for a while. 

If you look at that part of the position you can see it has been heavily shelled and the bunker on the road has been blown up by a direct hit. 

There are other already dead Russian soldiers laying in the woods with one very clearly visible quite close to the dugout they are in. 

Most likely what has happened is this position was hit with heavy artillery and this drone has been sent to assess the effect of the strike and Russian troop concentration at the location for possible follow up strikes or possible targets of opportunity for the drone. 

The 11 guys are in a larger dug out position which looks like something that might have previously been a mortar pit or a future bunker in the process of getting built. 

They are likely the only survivors from the artillery strike and they likely consolidated in to that dugout waiting to be allowed to leave or be replaced by some other troops (which may or may never show up but given the general front section this supposedly is at more cannon fodder will be sent to join them)

The original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of my favorite games of all time. It's inspired by a novella, *Roadside Picnic* which became the [film Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_\(1979_film\)).

Everyone is rightly shitting on Russia right now but the bleak and desperate Soviet Union made for some brilliant bleak and desperate fiction. 

The first Stalker game came out in 2007 and since then modders have gone absolutely nuts with it... combining the maps from all three games into one big open world, adding quests, weapons, survival systems and more while keeping the lonely spirit of the Zone alive.

BTW, any old stalkers out there should know about [g.a.m.m.a.](https://anomalymod.com/repacks/stalker-gamma/) which is kind of the culmination of all that crazy modding work of the last fifteen years.

I would describe the reporting as only appearing dire when compared to the unalloyed enthusiasm of many other sources. The producer of this channel is providing what appear to be realistic and well informed assessments and commentary I'm not seeing in other sources.

The video is making an important point about the benefits of having functioning electrical grid across the whole country and how in combination with rolling blackouts the generation capacity in the west of Ukraine can be used to share electricity with the eastern oblasts.
Should a national electrical grid ever have to disconnect into the regional grids it is not straightforward to reconnect it again due to the need to perfectly synchronise the grids before reconnecting.

He was tried in absentia and sentenced for treason. Free elections were held and his replacement was democratically selected by the Ukrainian people.

Nice try comrades. I'm particularly impressed by how hard it is to find information about that site which is basically because:

- the name of the site uses a term that returns TONS of credible uses in other literature about ""modern diplomacy""

- the site appears to be relatively new as most of the fact checking / media bias reporting sites either have zero listing or have yet to gather enough info about the site to be able to provide an evaluation (which of course should make it obvious that some site with a TON of content that JUST appeared out of nowhere should NOT be trusted)

Despite the above, I did find numerous references to the site on questionable sources like websites from Eurasian countries that are allied with Russia, as well as other trash sites like facebook, etc..

The accompanying story is strange, as I mentioned in my daily recap.  I think the editor of [this article](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/russia-says-it-foiled-ukrainian-sabotage-at-south-stream-gas-pipeline/) was similarly perplexed.  The [Reuters news release](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-foiled-sabotage-south-stream-gas-pipeline-2022-11-24/) says that the saboteurs were targeting SouthStream pipeline.  The SouthStream pipeline doesn't exist (at most there might be a few little pipeline sections designated for the failed project in [Varna, Bulgaria](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/geoeconomics-south-stream-pipeline-project/)).  The few pipeline parts built for the failed project in Russia were repurposed for the TurkStream pipeline.

Okay, so maybe someone misspoke.  Maybe they meant the saboteurs targeted TurkStream but called it SouthStream.  Except that Russia [already claimed](https://www.pipeline-journal.net/news/several-arrested-foiled-turkstream-pipeline-attack-according-russia) that Ukraine tried to [sabotage TurkStream in October](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-several-arrested-foiled-attack-turkstream-pipeline-interfax-2022-10-13/).

There are a multitude of reasons why what the allies have given Ukraine is the best they could give, at the right time, within realistic constraints.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't give more, or that more cannot be done.

On the subject of longer range missiles - they cost more and have 1, rather than 6 missiles. If you are trying to achieve the maximum battlespace effect, take the 6.

On the subject of planes; it's really hard and takes a long time to spin up the capability in logistics and maintenance. This alone makes it tricky, but Russia also has an obscene amount of AA platforms, making the capability expensive and risky compared to ground based ranged fires.

I want to support Ukraine with as much as we can give and more, but we need to trust our decision makers to give what they can, in a timely manner and that is sustainable from a training and logistics standpoint.

I will say it's surprised me that some sort of F-15/16 package wasn't spun up by April, which would potentially see results in the next few months but I would guess there are some very good reasons for it. Likewise modern tanks. But again, there is more to running military hardware than 'here is thing, go have fun'.

We need to lobby our reps for more support, no matter what country we are in but then trust the military experts about how to generate the best results from that support. For all we know, x, y or z system has complications in upscaling of production or maintenance.

Numbers count and if you want to suppress enemy AA and gain air superiority then you need to saturate the region with air assets for a period of time, likely the order of a hundred+ aircraft flying sorties round the clock for weeks, so that AA is being challenged by multiple air assets rather than vice-versa. And that is a huge logistical demand. 

Simply bleeding a dozen aircraft a month (say) into the warzone is not going to achieve air superiority and the attrition rate is probably going to stay at single figures of sorties.

The western neighbors of the Russian Federation have never concealed their desire to encroach on the territory of the Russian exclave, but they have never demonstrated it so openly before. This is the answer to the question why the issue of Suvalki corridor disappeared from the agenda: those who were planning to defend the corridor decided to strike first.

The most tactically prepared 336th Marine Brigade and 79th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 11th Corps are relocated to Donbas. Plans to deploy a full-blooded division based on the 11th Separate Tank Regiment are frozen.

""The expulsion of Russia from the former East Prussia would be an excellent gift for the October 2023 alliance summit in Vilnius,"" write the Lithuanians.

The Lithuanians consider it theirs and call it Karaliaučius, the Poles don't mind expanding their own Pomeranian borders.

Without budgetary aid Ukraine would not be able to finance the war, without humanitarian aid they would freeze. All of that helps Ukraine win and saves lives.

>Germany constantly lied this whole war like when they said they cannot send Marders to ukraine because western IFV cannot be send(other countries already send western IFV),

None as modern as marder, the best they got is modernized M113, a design from before the Vietnam war. And as always, if you would inform yourself, you would know the issue with marder is ammunition. It is made in Switzerland, which refuses to deliver to Ukraine.

Not even close. It has a $155 billion GDP and is the breadbasket of Europe. More importantly is the vast untapped oil wealth in Ukraine which Russia is really after.

NATO wasn't in Ukraine, and there was no indication Ukraine was ever going to be accepted into NATO.

Still Germany Economy is over 5 times of that of Poland.  3.3 bn from over 4 trillion of Germany economy compared to 2.94 bn from around 700 billion of Polish economy, Polish economy is affected a LOT more than Germany's, for Germany economy to be as affected, Germany help would have to be over 15 bn.

Still western  and how modern  it doesnt make a difference, russia didnt have problem with a lot more modern gear being send like artillery .
Also ammo issue can be resolved, if I am not mistaken some Germany military company brought recently ammo production company from Spain I think, if you need to produce ammo there is always a way to do so.

Yes Slovakia deal was pretty good, compared to that offer given to Poland was VERY BAD, I mean even orginally Germany offered Slovakia 15 leo 2 for 30 T-72, which would mean Germany offer to Slovakia would be half the amount of tanks Slovakia would give(but of course I recognize that leo 2 are better than T-72), meanwhile offer to Poland was around 1/12 of Poland given 20 for 240, just five more than they offered slovakia, its much MUCH worse deal then the one offered to Slovakia.

Again, you made the claim Poland send double what Germany did. It did not. I don't know why you persist with this.

It makes a huge difference. Otherwise Poland should be happy with getting Leo 1s since after all, makes no difference if a weapon system is modern or not, no?

It cannot, there is only one production line in the whole world producing this ammo. If you want it built somewhere else you would need to make a whole new production line, which will take years.

That doesn't say what you claimed it did, nor does it prove Poland was guaranteed modern Leopard 2s by Germany when they donated their tanks.

It is also the first round of negotiations, but apparently Poland decided to not negotiate any further in order to score some points in the press. I shall note that right now Poland is the one refusing to still negotiate, which makes the whole mess their fault.

According to François Heisbourg who is currently Senior Advisor for Europe at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) during his recent trip to main distribution center he had opurtunity to check data on deliveries, not promises, mainly concerning weapons and ammunition, weighing more than a million tons since the start of the war: the United States, unsurprisingly, accounts for 49%, the Poland for 22%, Germany 9%, Italy 3%

22% is more than double of 9%...

>It makes a huge difference. Otherwise Poland should be happy with getting Leo 1s since after all, makes no difference if a weapon system is modern or not, no?

And Poland would shot with what ? Poland doesnt have shells for them, at very least it would have to be usable. 
Why not give them to Ukraine if they still can be used ?

>It cannot, there is only one production line in the whole world producing this ammo. If you want it built somewhere else you would need to make a whole new production line, which will take years.

Same was said about ammo for Gepard yet it seems Germany plans to produce gepard ammunition in spain company they aquired.

>That doesn't say what you claimed it did, nor does it prove Poland was guaranteed modern Leopard 2s by Germany when they donated their tanks.

It litereally says about 100 leopards 1 and 20 leopards 2. And early in the war Germany did promise to backfill Poland with tanks of NATO standard. Hard to find article talking about it now because it was few months ago.

>It is also the first round of negotiations, but apparently Poland decided to not negotiate any further in order to score some points in the press. I shall note that right now Poland is the one refusing to still negotiate, which makes the whole mess their fault.

second  actually first one was leopards 1, second were leopards 2 after that GERMANY broken off further negotiations, NOT Poland.

>Are you honestly this dumb or are you willfully not understanding what Poland did wrong here?

lets me use same argument against you: Are you honestly this dumb or are you willfully not understanding what Germany did wrong by offering patriot system that CANNOT be used to protect Polish people  ?
(from perespective of Polish people who know that this system cannot be used to protect Polish from situation like the one just happen, it looks like Germany used tragedy that happen in Poland for PR to make themselves look internationally. let me use different situation as example, something bad happens in Germany, forest fire or floods, Poland sends fire fighters to help but those same fire fighters were forbidden from doing anything to help, how would it look  to Germany people ?

So...Marder would not be a good fit for UA then. Glad you conceded this point.

NATO standard, not most modern tanks. Leopard 1 and 2 are both NATO standard.

Bullshit, it was Poland. 


>lets me use same argument against you

You missed a crucial step, that Poland was actively asking for help and consultations on how to prevent this. Germany offered the same system everybody else uses, there is no system that would magically prevent everything so Germany offered the best they had. 

Poland then twisted that offer into something. 

No matter how much you try to deny this, it takes a lot of bullshit to turn a goodwill gesture into ""why you not do more"". 

And in your example, if Germany would first accept the firefighters then they would have no leg to stand on if they would then bitch about them either. 

The mere fact that you still try to twist this goodwill gesture into something sinister shows me all I need to know.

You do realize  there is no way to measure in dollar value without actually knowing who delivers what ? because countries dont announce everything that is being delivered.

Except as I pointed out to you its possible to start production of ammo for them.

yes but I didnt say anything about it being modern, I was only pointing out that Germany did promise

Yes Poland asked for help but they most likely realized that Germany offer would NOT work, I mean there are only two ways Germany  offer could work: first would be for Germany to be okay with firing into Ukraine airspace which would potentially mean joining the conflict(which is probably least likely option), and second is for the system to be placed  on Ukraine side by the border, that way missile could be intercepted before it reached poland and not to mention Ukraine side would be proteced too, win-win solution.

Poland didnt turn goodwill gesture  into anything more Poland just asked for solution to be used in way that would actually work.

>And in your example, if Germany would first accept the firefighters then they would have no leg to stand on if they would then bitch about them either.

Thats a BS, if you ask someone for help and they offer help you are grateful of course but you will definitly NOT be grateful if you find out that this help was actually a lie and someone just did it to look like he is helping.

>The mere fact that you still try to twist this goodwill gesture into something sinister shows me all I need to know.

You are LITERALLY doing same, you instantly believe that what Polish governmet is doing is something sinister, that they are just trying to use situation against Germany instead of you know looking for solution that would actually protect polish territory from situation like the one just happen, someone was KILLED in Poland meanwhile solution from NATO allies to Poland was offer anti-air system that litereally cannot do ANYTHING to protect Poland from such situations, litereal reason for why Poland asked NATO for help.
At least Poland was trying to find a solution which could use this system to actually protect Polish territory.

There are generally accepted figures that line up with what is announced. There is no worth in discussing unannounced aid since neither you nor I are privy to that information. 

>I was only pointing out that Germany did promise

A promise Germany kept, they offered NATO standard tanks. The number of them was open to debate.

Link to article then, all I know is that Lambrecht made an offer which Poland never replied to except thinking it is unacceptable, without making a counteroffer. Then they stopped talking.

Neither would any other offer. Which means that Poland is bitching because there is no magic fix, which is both unfair and ungrateful.
