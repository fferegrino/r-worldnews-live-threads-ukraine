>  
>The European Union’s executive arm is mapping out a path to end the bloc’s reliance on Russian gas which could see import needs cut by almost 80% this year, according to two officials with knowledge of the matter.  
>  
>The commission considers that the EU already has sufficient gas to get through the rest of this winter even in the event of an abrupt disruption of Russian supplies. The bloc’s executive arm will recommend that member states start work now on filling up storage tanks so they’re prepared for next winter.  
>  
>The commission is set to say that accelerating the Green Deal, the bloc’s sweeping strategy aimed at reaching climate neutrality by 2050, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut reliance on imported fossil fuels and shield the economy from price hikes, according to the official, who asked not to be identified, as discussions on the strategy are private. The proposals may still change before they are adopted.  
>  
>As part of the clean shift, the EU is currently discussing a set of laws to meet a stricter 2030 goal of cutting greenhouse gases by at least 55% from 1990 levels. Full implementation of the “Fit for 55” rules would cut EU gas consumption this decade by 23%, or an equivalent of 82 billion cubic meters.Tuesday’s plans will add on higher LNG imports and pipeline supplies from outside Russia, more renewable gases, energy savings and a shift to electrification. Together, that will give the EU the potential to effectively replace the 155 billion cubic meters of gas it currently imports from Russia, with 112 bcm this year.  
>  
>As much as 50 bcm a year will come from new sources of LNG, 10 bcm will come through pipelines from other suppliers and 20 bcm will come from new wind energy capacity which will reduce the demand for gas-fired power stations.The push may mean more ambitious 2030 targets for renewables and energy efficiency. The commission is also set to prioritize work on connecting pipelines on the Iberian peninsula with the rest of Europe and joining up Bulgaria and Greece.

Russians have been desperately trying to send forces in a long thrust across northern Ukraine to get to the East side of Kyiv to relieve pressure on their assault on NW side of Kyiv that's stalled. This convoy of fuel is desperately needed for the small amounts of men and material they have been able to gather in the villages East of Kyiv. Their logistics situation is terrible and pushing this far across northern Ukraine has been hard for them to secure the route, supply them and send enough forces all the way there.

They have so far been only able to mount weak probing attacks on the Eastern Kyiv suburb of Brovary since March 2nd and have been repelled several times. It's clear from pictures in the last week that they are trying to use dirt trails and avoiding main roads to avoid ambush. In this case they were hiding behind a railroad embankment and following it. However, they are slowly inching West down the M2 highway from Sumi to Kipti and will soon be able to cut off Chernihiv unless the Ukrainians can stop them. It's also not good that the Ukrainians are unable to do more than harass and ambush them in the country side and unable to block their thrust paralleling the M9 highway and SW to Brovary.

The Russians are slowly inching towards their short term goal which is to encircle and besiege Kyiv by pushing West down the M9 highway to Kipti then SW down the E95 to Kyiv.",1646672862.0,1646672316.0,t3_t8rxur,t3_t8rxur,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

Suddenly I have to spend a LOT more of my Wind Marks to buy the same stuff from before. But I'm still arguing and fighting with people, and that's resulting in more people refusing to take Wind Marks. People are giving me all their Wind Marks and demanding I give them their currency back.

My take on the convoy as I have seen a few comments about that the Ukrainians cannot attack it from the air because they will get shredded by AA fire and the like and that is why they are letting it hangout there and drown in mud.  This is probably partially true.  However, the Ukrainians have demonstrated they are pretty good at hit and run tactics.  If they somehow managed to get small squads of men targeting just the anti-air weapons in the convoy once they have aircraft armed and fueled to take a good portion of it, it isn't going to matter.  The convoy will be a sitting duck if it truly is bogged down in mud and partially abandoned as some are believing.  

Personally, I think a better use of the Ukrainian weapons would be to hold out and see if they can somehow commandeer some of these pieces of armour little by little and bring them into the fight against the Russians or use them as a confusion tactic.  If they could coordinate an attack against an armour group using their own weapons against it would be a serious mind-fuck on the armoured troops.  They would think every time they see a ""friendly"" over the hill that it could be another hidden enemy.  It would create a huge headache for the Russian troops and probably mount to a more than a handful of friendly fire instances so the Ukrainians can save some anti-armour weapons for when they really need it.

1. Install a Pro-Russian Government in Kiev (possibly Yanukovych) which will militarily weaken the state and leave it subservient to Russia like Belarus.
2. Get Donetsk and Luhansk independance, so they can integrate them into Russia later.
3. Get recognition of Crimea

I COULD see them try to annex all of Novorossiya from Donbas to Transnistria and leave the puppet state in the Northwest, but that's a tall order. This whole thing has been a disaster for Russia and the more directly they take power the worse the insurgency will be. 

The only way they'll survive the sanctions is for China to toss them a lifeline(which will probably just barely be enough to keep Russia afloat and will economically be massively in China's favor) long enough for the West to get bored and have a leadership change in a major country like America or France.

As far as I'm concerned, if they hold Ukraine for 15 years, they've got it.

The problem is, besides the fact that NATO is a **defensive** alliance, you really don't understand what Nuclear war would mean.
**Even a limited exchange** is enough to cause world wide famine and death.  A full scale exchange would probably end the human race.  **Including killing all the people in Ukraine.**


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read / view the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

If Putin is removed, then sanctions get lifted and Russia can bounce back.

Surely the Kremlin higher ups know that removing Putin is much better for themselves and Russia than destroying the entire world over one man's stupid decision - right?

It's not like there are fundamental differences between countries and Putin has the entire population backing him up and ready to die for this cause. The Kremlin knows the truth and that this was self-inflicted.

Also, the US has mainly been passive in regards to Russia - even after all the shit Putin has gotten away with over the years. It is in Putin's best interest to make NATO his enemy, not Russia's.

Plus, even if they all stay safe in a nuclear bunker. There is no life after this. No one will remember them. Their kids will not marry and have kids of their own. A bunker will not protect them from the chaos they unleash - all because of one stupid man.

>""The Security Forces of Ukraine along with the militants of the Azov battalion are plotting a provocation with possible radioactive contamination of the area near the city of Kharkov.

- Putin gets killed by one of his own

This would create a power vacuum. Historically, countries do not fare well in a power vacuum. Often when a dictatorial leader is removed by violence from someone in the inner circle, the new leader is someone who also seizes the power through violence. They most likely have military support as well. Look to the long succession of Roman Emperors as a great example of this problem.

This also creates an unstable country with multiple parties fighting for power and ends up getting citizens killed en masse.


- Putin dies in his sleep

Let's say he dies in his sleep, not because of murder. Literally the same as above.


- Putin is forced to step down by his peers

This can go one of two ways. I'll focus on one as the other will be a different example. If he is forced to step down by his peers (other oligarchs), this creates a similar power vacuum like example 1. The military will still play a role but the public knowledge of his resignation would also spark calls for a person votes into office. Keep in mind that this wouldn't guarantee a democratic government but potentially the continued illusion of one. If there is a popular oligarch from Putin's inner circle, it's more likely they will come into power than an outsider. Especially if they were one of the primary ones to force Putin to step down.



- Putin is removed by the masses

This is the type that creates democracies. However for this to even be a reality, the leader in question has to be weak. Say what you will of Putin's strongman persona, currently his appearance from this debacle of a war is weak. If the people depose him then there is a good chance that a true democracy can be established. Our world has a decent history of people throwing off the yoke of weak leaders to determine their own path through their own or through democratic means (US revolution, October revolution, Haitian Slave Revolt, French Revolution).

Keep in mind this doesn't always mean democracy and sometimes represents the will of the people but it doesn't always remain as such.

This is something to think about when calling for the death of a leader. Not to say Putin should stay but the best option for a better Russia is if the Russian people removed him themselves.",False,1646667609.0,t3_t8rxur,t3_t8rxur,,0,-6,0,-6,0,0,

&#x200B;

What would happen would a Russian strike actually trigger a nuclear even - be it in Kharkiv or one of the nuclear plants?

&#x200B;

1. Radiation poisoning over a large area, probably not contained to only Ukraine or Russia but also leaking towards Europe.
2. This would definitely trigger a response from Europe or even NATO. At this point Russia's actions are directly killing NATO members' civilians. Either NATO will step in and creates safe zones around all nuclear plants, or NATO will get directly involved in the war to prevent further such ""incidents"". It would be a disaster for the world, but also a disaster for Russia in particular as it would lose the war instantly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So they are trying this narrative in case something does actually happen. If an idiot Ivan accidentally bombs one of these sites and causes a meltdown, Russia will point to this and say ""it wasn't us, we warned you the Ukrainians are planning to sabotage their own reactors"".

Would it work? The West won't buy it for a second, but they are banking that some NATO states may not want to start WW3 and thus tacitly accept this explanation if it means not having their own soldiers on the ground die.

IMO we should go with a more WW2 style model depending on how this war plays out. 

If Ukraine remains independent the EU should invest heavily into the country until it can join. Create a similar plan as the Marshall plan for Ukraine. Help them come back stronger and continue to foster good will between EU and Ukraine. 

If Russian economy collapses and they come out of this with a new government. EU should aim with a similar plan. Reduce corruption, increase economic ties/investments, and promote democracy. EU will need to counter China from eating up Russia in it's weakened state from becoming a Chinese aligned nation. 

Those two are the ideal outcomes. Unfortunately they are also the least likely. But I can dream for a EU with a western friendly Russia in it's ranks. It would make EU the most powerful market in the world. Again I can dream but unlikely. 

At this point I don't think Russia can occupy Ukraine. They simply don't have the money and troops to afford it. Their economy is in the dumps. I think they will take Kyiv, try to turn Ukraine into an extremely unstable country by killing it's unifying leaders and pull out while funding both sides of a internal conflict.

As the new Russia came to be, the oligarchs and political leaders focused on personal enrichment and not growth in the country.

Russia has basically, as a nation, not grown with the times since then. While they have developed new military tech, most of it is still out dated compared to Western tech and all of it is woefully underfunded and what has been made is in very limited supply.

Simply put, they haven't had major money invested in their military since the late 1960s/1970s.

So, compared to 75% of the world's countries, they have a big military. Because those countries are using stuff Russia gave to them in the 1950s and 1960s.

Can take Trudeau or leave him. I’m not a big fan of him or anything…

I don’t hate him either. I think he’s doing as good a job of things as he can, and probably better than some I can think of.

The idea of tying your economy to other economies is one of the reasons beyond Nukes we haven't had a major world war in last 80+ years. Before the EU France and Germany were going at it every few years. The close economic ties of EU have made war impossible. I think that success played a large part in German investment in Russian Oil/Gas. It made war between them more difficult. However it also locks Germany from interfering when Russia acts out elsewhere. It is basically an economic MAD. I think Germany realizes the weakened position this puts it in and will make adjustments. I don't judge them too harshly for their Russian ties as long as they now begin to reduce those ties going forward.",False,1646675631.0,t3_t8rxur,t1_hzq7yyy,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

What you are seeing from the Russian citizens is years of living in an environment that has facilitated a certain idea, thought, narrative. These all come together to create what is called propaganda. It is basically an alternative universe storyline/reality that is being pushed by a group of people, in this case the entire Russian government. It is seen in the form of media, Internet, school, family, commercials, books, laws, government, etc.

You may be asking then, can’t they just go online? I mean TikTok and YouTube and Wikipedia and google and Facebook exist don’t they?

You’re right in that they exist, but governments like Russia, autocratic usually, have invested heavily over decades into alternative versions and systems that filter or follow the narrative and propaganda they want. Some Russian examples and topics you should look into are Yandex.ru, RUNET, Russia Tv, vk.com(VKontakte).

They enforce it by passing laws or in most cases just have enforcement agencies who enforce things violently or with threats. Regardless if it is legal or not.

That is why things like freedom of speech, net neutrality, whistle blower protection, freedom of information, and many other things the west champion for are important to humanity as a whole. It allows people to see lies and to have a broader scope of what is happening in the world. Allows them to make better choices.

What’s scary is that it isn’t necessarily only the game of autocratic governments. Everyone is subject to propaganda in their lives. Be it from their employers, their political affiliations, Media News, family. Just different degrees. That is why it is so important to be curious, to have sources and proof for what people think from objective sources. It’s important to think for yourself.

War crimes are generally (not specifically referring to things like Geneva) general guidelines that two sides agree with each other on so that the war is less painful for both both of them.

 For example, one of the earliest things outlawed before WWI was expanding bullets, because all they did was cause unneeded pain and medical costs but didn't actually help anyone achieve any tactical success. 

The practical consequence of one side using expanding bullets, in this scenario, would be the other side using them too to get them back.

US embargoing Russian Oil would give the US the moral highground (willing to take a hit nationally to stand up to ""the bully"" internationally).The US hasn't really ""lead"" the ""free world"" in decades, even though it acted like it. This would be good gesture to go back down that path, without wasting the lives of US citizens.

 It will put a lot of political pressure on Western Europe to man the fuck up. The politicians might not want to do it - but there will be increased public pressure which can/could be translated into increased political pressure (basically giving opposition parties talking points that can be used to gain votes - ""if you elect us we'll cut Russian oil and gas!"").

&#x200B;

Someone has to be first - and US is probably better positioned than most. Its economy is large enough that it can take a hit and it's also large enough to matter. It's one thing when Portugal (as example) would take this measure, it's another when it's one of the biggest economies on the planet. It would also send a signal to China - ""we can take a hit and a bit of discomfort if it means cutting ties with you"". Suddenly the threat of higher prices (be it oil, gas, clothes or iphones) would not longer be such a good deterrent for action against oppressive or downright hostile regimes. 

&#x200B;

However - all of this would need to translate into popular support as well. If the people are not properly insulated and motivated, then come next election cycle this would be repealled and politicians probably refrain from even suggesting it in the future.

In that axis of advance through the country side there has been very little news after a week ago when there was 2 big ambushes of Russian armor columns near Purluky and Sribne by ATGM teams. Supposedly the Russians responded by slowing down their dash and bringing up more manpower to secure the towns and villages along the way. Reports were that Russian soldiers were combing through these areas and confiscating cellphones.

So it would appear this has made it harder for the Ukrainian military and militia to coalesce and maneuver in that area. This convoy was a target of opportunity and not an armored column that they attacked a week ago. And very little social media info has made it out of that area in the past week meaning the Russian hold along that axis is tightening. So while this frustrates the Russian effort to dash to Kyiv from the East, it only slows them down and not stop them.

Also, this axis and the area they are holding could be redundant as they have slowly grinded down Ukrainian resistance along the key M9 highway that they really want to push armor to Kyiv via M9 then E95. They have gotten closer and closer to Kipti, doing so would mean cutting off Chernihiv. Russians were previously stuck a dozen kilometers West of Konotop due to stiff Ukrainian resistence, so out of desperation they went SW to avoid the highway and made lightning progress dashing to Kyiv at first.

They’ve been trying to craft the narrative that the biggest victims of the Nazis were Russian Christians, and that the history of the Holocaust was rewritten to only focus on the persecution of Jewish people.


So when Putin says the Ukrainian govt is run by Nazis, we can all brush it off as being absurd, but it means something completely different to their audience in Russia and the white nationalists abroad who see Putin as a strong ally. And to them it’s then a logical rationale for invading - to defend the Russian-speaking separatists in Eastern Ukraine who have been under attack by the Ukrainian govt since the Crimean war started in 2014. I don’t agree with any of it, but that’s the context.

Still the six to one can be achieved locally, assuming there is still enough mobility to concentrate in a few areas.

They claim Jews are white supremacists, which is fucking absurd. The majority of Jews in Israel are not Ashkenazi, the only group you could argue is ""white.""

They claim Israel is an apartheid state, even though Arab Israelis serve in the military and all branches of government and have equal rights under the law. Also, Palestinian authorities do not allow Jews to live in Palestinian territory, even if they aren't Israeli citizens. Gaza won't even allow Arab Christians to be open with their religion.

They claim Israel is an ethnostate, even though -- again -- the country is 20% Arab and Arabs are not second class citizens.

From the 1950’s to the 2010’s they dropped over 2000 nukes for testing, and people didn’t notice any change in their everyday lives. The second generation of nuclear bombs rely on two-step fusion bombs which give off a lot less radiation in proportion to the damage that they do, and the damage would be about equal to what we saw in Hiroshima. This is because Hiroshima was mostly destroyed by the subsequent firestorm rather than the initial bombing, but it is unlikely with modern infrastructure that a firestorm would occur at all. All the currently usable ones are also about 10x smaller than the biggest bomb made, because the Tsar Bomba was only made to scare the US and is literally too big to reliably fire during war.

MAD is based on a theoretical scenario in which the world exhausts its nuclear arsenal and causes damage so significant that the world becomes uninhabitable. It is based on years, if not decades of nuclear warfare. Dropping even a few hundred nukes, while devastating, would most likely not end civilization. Dropping one wouldn’t significantly impact life for anyone other than the people who got bombed and maybe their immediate neighbours.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Republics are administrative divisions originally created as nation states to represent areas of non-Russian ethnicity. The indigenous ethnic group that gives its name to the republic is referred to as the titular nationality.

In this situation the marginal cost (ie the cost to pump/refine/sell) a barrel of oil should equal marginal demand (the cost the next person is willing to pay) for that barrel of oil. These resources are constantly being sourced/pumped. OPEC as a cartel has lost its price fixing monopoly so its difficult to set prices higher. There are more complex factors involved in a market including factoring in future events into the current price (ie if the market fears prices will skyrocket then prices will rise in the present as people are willing to buy more now in hopes of buying cheap compared to the future cost).

My overall point being that yes sellers are greedy in the sense that they are trying to maximize profit. But they can't set the market themselves (short of a monopoly or cartel) What is something worth? Exactly what someone is willing to pay for it. Demand and supply work together to set the price. Even a 4% decrease in supply is a big deal for a market. Yes US producers can produce more but its more complex than simply turning a faucet. It might take 3-6 months to ramp up domestic production to satisfy the market demand.

&#x200B;

TLDR: We like to bash corporations for being greedy and sometimes its justified (ie price gauging epi-pens and other life saving patented medical products) but in the case of oil you have a room full of corporations that are seeking to maximize profits. Short of a monopoly or collusion a given company can't be greedy and set prices artificially higher.

There are ship-launched, submarine-launched and air-launched versions of the missile, and variants for anti-ship, anti-submarine and land attack use. Some versions have a second propulsion stage that initiates a supersonic sprint in the terminal approach to the target, reducing the time that target's defense systems have to react, while subsonic versions have greater range than the supersonic variants.

The missile systems (Искандер-М) are to replace the obsolete OTR-21 Tochka systems, still in use by the Russian armed forces, by 2020. The Iskander has several different conventional warheads, including a cluster munitions warhead, a fuel-air explosive enhanced-blast warhead, a high explosive-fragmentation warhead, an earth penetrator for bunker busting and an electromagnetic pulse device for anti-radar missions. The missile can also carry nuclear warheads.

Little Boy went off at once when exploding, so Hiroshima was habitable pretty soon after the initial fallout subsided. Very few people who died in Hiroshima died of radiation; a vast majority died of burns, infections or falling debris. Chernobyl on the other hand was still burning post-explosion, and the reaction was still happening. That’s why they had to drop things over the top, to slow the reaction down. For weeks the reaction was burning in an open-top reactor, constantly chugging more radioactive particles into the air. That’s why Chernobyl is so messed up.

The reason the firestorm wouldn’t happen is because they studied it after it didn’t happen the same way in Nagasaki, and found out that it was an anomaly. It occurred because of 1.) climate at the time 2.) Hiroshima being a completely flat city with no natural cover 3.) the entirety of the city being made basically from extremely over-crowded wood buildings. Fire bombings were used in Japan because the country was notoriously bad at containing fires, and any sort of attack involving arson was brutally effective. There is almost no chance of a firebomb happening anywhere else with the way modern infrastructure is designed in most countries.

Also how am I downplaying nukes? I’m pointing out the realistic effects. We know that dropping a few nukes doesn’t change a lot in terms of everyday life for most people because we’ve dropped a buttload of them for testing and other than people being freaked out by reports of higher radioactivity in places, nobody has noticed anything change in their daily lives. I’m not trying to say we should be dropping nukes everywhere, but I don’t think the extreme paranoia around nuclear weapons is particularly helpful especially when none of us have any ability to control whether they get dropped or not.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

The problem previously with the stalled convoy was that left flank could then scoot more south and around SW of the capital using the stalled convoy as a shield. Flanking the UA army positions. *That is no longer the case.*
