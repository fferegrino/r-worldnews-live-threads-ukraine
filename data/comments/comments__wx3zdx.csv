Day 183 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was actually a pretty quiet day, there was no shelling, and no missiles made it to the city either. It does feel nice having some peace sometimes, though somehow it feels weirder than being shelled. What is even weirder is that you actually get used to the constant shelling and missile strikes after a while, that’s not something I thought was possible before this war started.

There was a missile strike today, they fired 3 missiles, but none of them were aimed at the city, all of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, one missile was also intercepted during the day, but we don’t know where it was headed. Apparently one of the missiles that they launched yesterday malfunctioned and blew up in the air by itself. Their missiles really do get worse with each day, and that’s great news for us.

Also Russians admitted that they struck that civilian train yesterday, but those pieces of shit said that they killed 200 soldiers and destroyed 10 vehicles with that strike. They killed 25 civilians, including 2 children, not soldiers. Why the fuck would they say such bold lies when there’s literal video evidence of what was hit? Regular people from that train station were filming the aftermath, not soldiers. There were no military vehicles, and there were no soldiers.

>ENS President, Prof. Leon Cizelj, answered them highlighting some key points:  
>  
>Russian military forces control the Zaporizhzhia NPP since March 4, 2022. The plants are operated by the Ukrainian staff, which is working in extremely difficult conditions. Workers’wellbeing and their personal safety are deeply concerning and should be at the center of the international attention and action. ENS recognises the dedication and expertise of our Ukrainian colleagues who have been safely generating the power that citizens need.  
>  
>Because of VVER reactor characteristics, *these power plants cannot explode, so all comparisons with the Chernobyl accident are not correct at all*. In the unlikely case that one or more reactors would be damaged and go into a meltdown, the most impacted area would be just around the plants. Even if people would be exposed to serious doses, it’s unlikely to develop acute radiation sickness or even die there. The facility’s staff will most likely stay within the allowed professional dose limits, as happened in Fukushima. The moderate or low potential for impact on human health would be limited to a radius of approximately 20-30 km.

>One way or another, there is the prospect that there will soon be a court in which Putin and those who share responsibility for the aggressive war being waged in Ukraine could be prosecuted. The crime of aggression is a crime that can be personally committed only by leaders with official power to conduct war. However, any treaty establishing a special international court for Russia’s war of aggression could and should provide authority to prosecute accomplices who do not have the required official power to commit the crime of aggression on their own but have aided and abetted Putin. The authority to prosecute accomplices is provided in the statute establishing the ICC and in treaties creating other international criminal tribunals established by the U.N., such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

>In his speech in Arizona, Kara-Murza signaled that creating a special international tribunal to try Putin and members of his regime for aggression could contribute greatly to ending the invasion of Ukraine. Kara-Murza undoubtedly knew when he returned to Russia he would be imprisoned and possibly killed.

- It is an Antonovsky bridge and cable above most likely is an electricity cable located close to the camera.

Tweet has imagery showing features of the bridge that are visible in the photos. FWIW, Kherson Cat lived in Kherson until the war started, so hopefully knows what the bridge looks like.

It's hard to see with such a grainy video, but, just to the left of the rightmost pier, it looks to me like there's a section there that is sagging. Does anyone else see that, or is it just my eyes tricking me?

But it’s six months later, and the only thing I read in Russian or Ukrainian press that resembles mother opposition comes from the ethnic minorities, the republics, but it’s DL and is basically personal persuasion efforts to refuse to fight in Ukraine.

This generation of ethnic-Russian mothers is not the same as 40 years ago.  They’ve become consumed with greed, valuing it over life and family.  It’s an indifference that seems inhumane, when compared what is universally recognized as maternal love; they’d rather have car and a new phone.

All those conscripts are used for jobs within Russia like logistics, administration, maintenance and repair, border security and other jobs. Increasing the length of service would help alleviate some staffing issues in Russia but it doesn't get more Russian soldiers in Ukraine.

There are some forcibly drafted people from the occupied Donbas being sent to the front but that is a limited pool to draw from and they aren't from within Russia itself.  Yes a few conscripts from Russia ended up in Ukraine during the initial invasion, most likely because many officers thought it was just a training exercise within Russia and they were in jumping off points for the invasion and essentially got taken along for the ride. They were then sent back to Russia and since then they have not been using any conscripts within Ukraine, they are all volunteers. That's why Russia is having such problems replacing lost and injured soldiers, they have to get volunteers. And the lack of people wanting to volunteer is why the amount of money they're offering for contracts to fight in Russia keeps going up and up and they are offering freedom to convicts in prison that will sign up to fight.

If Russia could send draftees to Ukraine they wouldn't be needing to do all that and they would have more soldiers to fight in Ukraine. To send draftees Putin would need to formally declare war and enact full mobilization which would allow him to send forcibly drafted Russians to Ukraine to fight but it's clear at this point he thinks it would spark too much opposition to the war or he would have done it already.

1. Lack of trained military personnel. It seems a large portion of the best ones (that they could risk) were ""spent"" in the initial wave, leaving a lot of people with relatively little training. They could still make gains, but it seems to have slowed down greatly- partially because they're working from smaller stocks, including people impressed into the Russian military in the occupied territories who don't want to be there and may not even be properly trained for combat. If the Syrians and North Koreans actually send people with combat expertise that could fix the hole, but Syria seems averse to letting them go (which makes sense- the Civil War continues, especially as Turkey now runs the north) and North Korea...Yeah I'm not sure what I could add there.

2. Lack of proper weapons and methods to buy more. This may be false and they're hiding the ""real"" stuff for an actual NATO conflict, but as a result they seem to be left with relatively less modern arms that can't counter stuff like HIMARS and the high powered drones that seem to do more damage than the off-the-shelf Chinese ones. The sanctions are not breaking Russia as much as expected, but they still heavily curtail the sourcing of equipment. Not ""prevent"" mind you- but it vastly increases the price (see https://qz.com/1769789/how-iranian-airlines-evade-us-sanctions/ for how Iran sources parts for its planes; TL;DR: smuggling with much higher prices).

If you know the river flow rate and time it right you can make sure it arrives at night and is harder to spot.

Or, you could hollow out some logs, pack 'em with C4, add in a remote detonator. When you know enough time has passed for them to make it to the bridge, hit the button.

The nature of the pontoon bridge means it should collect any debris going downstream, after all, as it floats on the surface, so floating materials should start to pile up on the upstream side. 

Of course, I don't know if there's a safe area to launch such a thing from. You wouldn't want to be *too* far upstream, because river bends, etc increase the chance of your floating bomb to get caught on the shoreline or something. 

There are some wooded areas on the shore immediately upstream. I'm thinking an inflatable raft, dispatched at night loaded with C4 or other high explosive, with some sort of GPS that phones home and tells you when it makes it to the bridge, and a remote detonator could be the easiest to deploy with a small team. You could also rig up a timer with a reasonable delay, if you know the river's flow rate. I'd of course wait until the bridge is done so there's no chance it would float through the uncompleted parts and past the bridge.

\- Russia has failed most major objectives with their original goal of overthrowing the UA government being a ""complete failure""

\- Russia has been seeing limited success in their Donbas Offensive, achieving roughly 2/3 occupation of this region

\- However, elsewhere they have been seeing more setbacks than success

\- Putin comes with no military experience, but intelligence / KGB experience and believes himself to be a ""military genius"". However, most of his military operations have been rather disastrous, including Ukraine.

\- Putin is a dictator who is surrounded by people who won't tell him the truth about what the situation is on the ground and has a ""delusional"" understanding of the situation in Ukraine.

\- Russia has done a better job at modernizing their navy and airforce (I beg to disagree here) but their army has barely been reformed since WWII and that is becoming clear with their ""poor"" and ""eye-opening"" performance in Ukraine. RU has had to call in troops from all of their (limited) other theatres including the borders of states that Russia typically has a strong presence around, including China.

\- Russia is at threat of getting bogged down in Ukraine and forced to decide between protecting against China and continuing the war in Ukraine. China has (interestingly) maintained a large number of troops on the Russian border, and China and Russia historically have an adversarial relationship - so no guarantees China wouldn't make a land-grab if Russia was in a tough spot.

On Ukraine

\- Ukraine is fighting for its life, and has a large enough population to field a massive army (1mil+) and continue fighting indefinitely, as long as the West continues to support Ukraine even if it gets painful.

\- Good chance this could be an open-ended war for years....

\- Estimates it will be an ""on-off"" conflict that has ceasefires, breaks of the ceasefire, hot conflicts, etc...

Anti-aircraft missiles, whether launched by air, sea, or land, are expensive. They're designed to fly fast and have a combination of sensors and countermeasures to guide the missile to a moving and evading target. The actual part that goes boom is fairly small and designed to spread shrapnel either spherically or radially that cuts through the target and allows the target's momentum to tear it apart.

Ground attack munitions that are designed to penetrate bunkers or armored vehicles concentrate their explosive power forward. An anti-aircraft missile would just scratch the paint on a tank.

The explosive filler on an AIM-9 Sidewinder is between 10 and 25 pounds depending on variant. This is similar to a NATO standard 155mm blast fragmentation artillery shell.

The longer range AIM-120 has a warhead weight of about 40-50 pounds depending on variant

Heavy SAMs fired by the S300/S400 can reach 300 pounds in a missile that weights 4,000 pounds. These are designed to be used against ground targets as a secondary function.

Their best equipment, their best divisions of specialized fighters, ground and air support. They’ve had a substantial portion of their navy holding down the Black Sea for six months — all of which costs money and requires repairs, which is getting harder and harder with sanctions.

1) dig in, hope for a freezing winter in Europe and hope to Christ that European leaders buckle under high energy prices and stop supporting Ukraine. Even then, incredibly difficult to gain more territory, but at this point he’d probably settle for holding what he has. For now. 

2) start managing expectations for a slow pullback out of the country, extracting the maximum amount of pain on the way out.

But nobody started paying attention until Biden, with his far lower amounts (sure, some people are fair and disagreed with both, but not common). And it almost certainly DID have some effect on inflation. But we saw a nightmare of supply chain issues. COVID surpressed labor availability along every link. Ports had to partially shut down, ships had to pay workers for months waiting, not enough workers could be hired for trucking, dockwork, retail, logistics... which led to further delays and costs. It all cascaded, along with rising wages. But rising wages weren't everything as many people think, the cost of food, supplies, inputs, etc. increased at far higher than the pace of wage inflation. due to these supply chain issues. Even China has had trouble pushing at goods predictably and inexpensively. It's been pure chaos. We are making progress, for example Biden incentivizing LA port to stay open 24 hours to address backlog, and working with industry leaders to address other bottlenecks. Oil prices are also dipping.

The key to this debate. If this inflation reduction act is really just going to worsen inflation, as the money-supply hawks say, in addition to the money supply already being expanded... then inflation should keep going up or stay steady

If it's due more to labor shortages, energy costs and supply chain issues, then inflation should slow, continuing a trend we are already seeing.

My personal tinfoil hat theory is that China was fully intending to move on Taiwan at the same time that Russia moved on Ukraine. What China and Russia both were not expecting was the west to move as swiftly with a unified voice as they did. Nor did they expect Ukraine to stand and fight with the fury of a pissed off tiger that got woken up because you kicked it in the balls.   


China about that time probably realized that if the US knew Russia's war plans they'd certainly have a pretty good idea what China was intending to do. The republicans did a swift 180 on the CHIPS act after several of them were given a private security briefing because if the US lost access to Taiwan's chips and we couldn't make our own we'd be up shit creek.   


I think Europe learning what China was up to \\ intends to do down the road realized that if the US goes to war with China we wouldn't be able to focus 100% on Russia.

Comparing it to a GRAD barrage is imo nonsensical. That covers a large area, this woud give you (overwhelming) firepower over what would be pinpoint targets. You could literally get that same result with one or two BMPs.
Hell, strap twin BTR turrets on a MT-LB and you get the same thing for much cheaper, with more ammo and against stationary infantry targets the difference between AA 35mm and 14.5mm would be negligible.

Using a SPAA in the manner you suggest it would be like throwing hammers to kill a fly stuck on flypaper. 

Also, any wire guidance is susceptible to damage, and this would attract A LOT of rpg/mortar/drone/arty fire. Wireles guidance can be jammed. And if any of those happen, you just lost (or worse, gave the enemy) a perfectly good SPAA just to scare some infantry to death for half a minute.

Numerous reports have emerged in recent weeks about Wagner’s alleged new recruiting drive among inmates, with the private Russian military force ostensibly trying to shore up Russian forces that have been depleted by heavy losses in the nearly six month war.But this appears to be the first time that Yevgeny Prigozhin, commonly known as “Putin’s chef,” is said to have personally appealed to inmates.“They are primarily interested in murderers and robbers, they treat the drug addicts warily, the same with the rapists. It’s better, he said, for it to not be common killers, but straight up calculating ones–you will like it with us, he said. In general, he gave the impression of a maniac,” one unnamed inmate was quoted telling Mediazona.The inmate went on to note there seemed to be no coercion to join, though “very many” did sign up, he said, estimating that at least 200 inmates eagerly accepted the offer.Inmates were reportedly offered a free pardon and a paycheck in return for their service, with the man identified as Prigozhin promising they had only a 15 percent chance of dying, a figure reportedly based on an “experimental” deployment of inmates earlier in July."" =- Daily Beast",False,1661448622.0,t3_wx3zdx,t1_ilq3vhp,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The gun has a longer reach, faster tracking, is more accurate and has fewer countermeasures than most MANPADS. It also is quicker in target acquisiton than a MANPAD and quicker to reach the target. It is more than competitive in all aspects to a manpad....except for training and operating costs.

Also, your concept of its guidance, is not up to date, its not a system that has had incremental upgrades through the years in the same way that an American platform has. It still relies on a laser range finder mounted right between the guns to set fusing for rounds. This gives it certain limitations regardless of how fast it can slew, because if a target is moving fast enough that it needs to be lead by more than  the fov of the range finder, it can't properly set fuse timings. 

Its a system that was designed to defeat helicopters. Im sure its extremely effective in that role. 

The stated range of the rounds, is not anywhere close to where it can reliable engage targets, and the number of rounds it needs to expends goes up exponentially with distance to target. 

Lets take the C-RAM for example, firing at 4000 rounds a minute, and definitely way more advanced, it required on average 300 rounds fired, to defeat a target. 

Thats half the total capacity of the Gepord, and thats assuming that per shot, the Gepard is as effective as a C-RAM system, which I would be absolutely astonished if it came anywhere close. 

If a Helicopter overflies it, yeah the helicopter is gonna have a bad day. Most modern aircraft wouldn't have much issue. As is the limitation with gun based systems, the MOA of the guns, is such that for higher altitude engagements, or engagements on a fast moving target, an inordinate amount of ammo must be expended. 

Also if you look at more modern systems that use radar guidance for gun based systems, they are all stationary, as its been figured out that these limitations in terms of ammo burn and MOA limitations for such high cyclic rates of fire means you really have to throw a lot of metal at a target. Which is why if you look at something like the C-RAM or Phalynx systems, or similar modern systems, they are all firing at cyclic rates above 3000 rounds a minute, which puts into perspective how dated something that is a precursor to these kinds of systems is throwing just a 1000 rounds a minute at a target, when you have a limited window of engagement, and when you are broadcasting to everyone thats listening exactly where you are. 

Which is exactly why it was placed to be used as forward radar for MANPADs, you know those things that don't broadcast not 1 but two HEY LOOK IM RIGHT HERE and Im not very fast radar signals, and a laser.
