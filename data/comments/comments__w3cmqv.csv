>  
>""Today I want to address you as politicians and party representatives. And also as mothers and fathers, grandfathers and grandmothers, daughters and sons. I want to address you not as the first lady, but as a daughter, as a mother.""  
>  
>Olena Zelenska mentioned 4 y.o. Lisa who was killed by a Russian missile attack in Vinnytsia. 5 y.o. Eva who died under the rubble in Ochakiv. Visitors of the shopping mall in Kremenchuk who are no more alive. And many other Ukrainians who were killed or wounded by Russia.  
>  
>""We are grateful that the US stands with us in the fight for our shared values of human life and independence. You help us very powerfully. While Russia kills, America saves. And you should know it. We thank you"", said Zelenska.  
>  
>""I'm asking for something now that I never wanted to ask for"", said the Ukrainian first lady. ""I am asking you for weapons. Not to wage war on someone else's land, but to protect our home and the right to wake up in it alive"".  
>  
>Zelenska specifically asked for air-defense systems. ""So that missiles do not kill children in their strollers. So that they do not destroy children's rooms and entire families"".  
>  
>""The US, unfortunately, knows what terrorist attacks are and always strives to defeat terrorism. Help us stop the terror against Ukrainians - and this will be our joint victory - in the name of life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness of every person, every family"" - Zelenska.  
>  
>The first lady concluded: ""This is what I am asking and my husband is asking for it - not as a presidential couple. But as parents and as children of their parents. ... I hope you heard me today. And I hope that your decisions will be quick"".

🪖 On Tuesday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  This doesn’t mean nothing happened and [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1549560891762479112), [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549516813419126790.html) and [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549439438505365507.html) will be happy to lead you through the weeds. 

🍄 Yesterday, Ukraine hit the [Antonivs’kyy Bridge](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1549475545284546561) over the Dnipro river near Kherson.  This is one of two major supply roads into the city of Kherson, and the destruction of the roads would leave russian forces with [no escape route](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1549474887365951489).  The damage to the bridge was [relatively minor](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549521920026185728.html), but will likely make transit of heavy equipment problematic.  

🍄 Someone has been counting HIMARS logistics attacks and made [a great map](https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1549447074550366208).  And with this [salvo of M270 missles](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1549446109365411845) no doubt more dots will be added soon!

🪂 On Tuesday a russian SU-35 attack aircraft [was downed](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1549465609896923137) either by russian air defense, or [Ukrainian air defense](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/15495176866144174104), or [Ukrainian bomber jets](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1549455888720723970) near [Nova Kakhovka](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1549462717798486017).  It doesn’t really matter.  A kill is a kill, and that’s $35 million dollars russia isn’t going to be able to use again.  russia did claim it was a drone that was hit.  If so, it’s fortunate the [drone’s pilot](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1549473838525825026) escaped safely.  This is the second [high value russian aircraft](https://twitter.com/muya_gichigi_ll/status/1548981314547851265) lost in as many days.

🔥 Gazprom’s gas delivery to Europe is in a bit of a quantum superposition with many reports saying the gas is [staying off](https://twitter.com/SStapczynski/status/1549330198989926402), and many reports saying the gas is going to be [turned back on](https://twitter.com/martinthebrave/status/1549448801680769028) at least a little, and putin today saying Gazprom will carry out its obligations [‘in full’](https://twitter.com/STForeignDesk/status/1549512544787697664) so we will all just have to wait and see what actually happens.  Meanwhile, Mariupol won’t have a [heating season](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1549544616780632064) this year.

🎁 US Secretary of Defense John Kirby announced that the US will be providing additional [HIMARS rocket launchers](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1549503708991561734) as well as rockets and artillery shells.  The donations will be valued at around $700 million dollars and will be allocated from President Biden’s [drawdown authority](https://twitter.com/JacquiHeinrich/status/1549484507518091267) and not against the $20 billion in military support authorized by Congress earlier in the year.

🎁 The EU and Ukraine signed a memorandum of understanding which will provide [€1 billion euros](https://twitter.com/VDombrovskis/status/1549389698174533633) to help fund Ukraine’s war-torn economy.  The money will be paid out at the end of July.  The EU also agreed to another [€500 million euros](https://twitter.com/SpencerGuard/status/1549385721579859968) in military aid.

👉 According to the German newspaper Die Welt, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been [cutting aid to Ukraine](https://twitter.com/UaBabel/status/1549484218543181825) all while promising more support.

💰 The EU moved to [increase sanctions on russia](https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/status/1547893105809977346) while at the same time clarifying existing sanctions to allow for humanitarian trade in food and fertilizers.

👉 Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelensky [met](https://twitter.com/OstapYarysh/status/1549455664300171264) with First Lady Jill Biden on Tuesday and announce that injured Ukrainian children will be able to travel to the US to be [fitted for prosthetics](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1549386051566927875).  Mrs. Zelensky also received, on behalf of the Ukrainian nation, a [dissident human rights award](https://twitter.com/ZelenskaUA/status/1549546340790714368).

🥷 Ukrainian spooks are having a bit of fun by creating [a website](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1549445096508096514) for the independence of the russian republic of Tatarstan.  A quick check of the website’s bonafides show that the website is registered and hosted in Ukraine.  Along the same vein, there are [tweets about Chechen rebels](https://twitter.com/lilygrutcher/status/1549338156385935360) mounting an insurgence which is something that should very well be seen to be believed.

👉 One of the Ukrainian strikes yesterday took out a valuable [surveillance radar](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1549523824521216002) that was a part of russia’s air defense network in Kherson.

👉 putin met with the leaders of Turkey and Iran, discussing several issues of [regional importance](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549482089657016321.html), though nothing publicly about Ukraine.  From the videos it appears russia’s [place in the world](https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1549472588035932160) pecking order has fallen substantially of late.  

👉 Correction: In the July 18^th report, I stated that Azerbaijan’s gas flowed through pipelines in Armenia.  In actuality the pipelines go through Georgia to the north, although better relations with Armenia could make for more efficient pipelines in the future.

👉 Ukraine created a [special commission](https://twitter.com/AndriyYermak/status/1549382192198991873) to monitor the use of weapons provided by international partners.  russian propaganda said that many western systems ended up on the black market, and this will be a way to counter those accusations.  Meanwhile in Mariupol, russia is [removing the right](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1549410628296646656) to own real estate.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 20 July 2022
 
- Russia continues to make minimal gains in its Donbas offensive, with Ukrainian forces holding the line.

- On 19 July 2022, the authorities in Russian-occupied Kherson reported that the Antonovskiy Bridge over the Dnieper River had been struck by Ukrainian forces. Social media posts showed apparent battle damage to the bridge's roadway.

- It is highly likely that the bridge remains usable - but it is a key vulnerability for Russian Forces. It is one of only two road crossing points over the Dnieper by which Russia can supply or withdraw its forces in the territory it has occupied west of the river.

- This area includes the city of Kherson, which is politically and symbolically important for Russia. The lower reaches of the Dnieper present a natural barrier, with the waterway typically around 1000m wide. Control of Dnieper crossings is likely to become a key factor in the outcome of fighting in the region.

Rafales and Gripens are both very capable planes, on paper they are considerably more advanced than early block F16s..but what makes them obviously impractical is only about 250 Rafales and 250 Gripens have ever been built, with no meaningful surplus of planes in any country. That also means less instructors, less parts available and less capacity to backfill losses. So in practical terms, if the plan was to provide those you'd be talking 10 or 20 planes tops with lengthy manufacturing lead times and Sweden or France agonising over what they could spare.

In contrast there are literally thousands of F16s floating around - the US could take 100 out of national guard or reserve stocks tomorrow without a second thought- and of crucial importance for an ongoing conflict they have a virtually infinite supply of parts, armaments and people capable of training pilots and ground staff. If they start training ukrainians to fly F16s, that guarantees them access to a credible highly effective fighter, with several decades of air to air combat experience under its belt, for the foreseeable future.

As with every form of military equipment, ukraine doesn't necessarily need the absolute rolls royce option- they're fighting a hot war where thousands are dying on the ground each week and where losses are simply a fact of the sort of existential struggle they are engaged in- with that in mind what they need is a reliable standardised supply of a modern, reliable aircraft as soon as they can train pilots for them. Given the impact of sanctions on things like modern avionics, and the huge commitments the russian airforce has in terms of keeping their own airspace safe, air combat is one area where ukraine actually could quickly win a battle of attrition if they have a reliable supply of pilots and aircraft. If they know they have, for arguments sake, 50 F16s active and 20 new planes and pilots coming online every month thereafter for as long as necessary, that would totally change the way they fight this war and allow them to be way more aggressive going after russian planes and ground targets.

Now that the initial urgent period of this conflict is over the West needs to get out of this mentality of sending Ukraine penny packets of wildly different equipment from different countries, simplify their logistics and look at volume solutions.

Idk why everyone thinks everything is perfect, and they could easily pay and take some hundred billions debt extra all the time. They already paid a fckton during Covid19. For a big economy with a lot of citizens it's not that easy to adapt as for a tiny country with just a few million citizens. If you don't wanna lose living conditions you will have to trade with Asia. EU is probably more instable than many think. There are also like more than ten times more people dying in Africa because of famine now, than in Ukraine because of the war. Should we be rational thinking here too? You have WFP asking for a few billions to solve world hunger, and they are not getting them easily. Lithuania donates around 100.000 there, Germany 1.5billion. But this stuff and other organisation donations will never make the news. Blaming Germany for everything is trendy rn, especially because they learned to accept guilt, so it's easy to do. 

The sanctions were intended to stop trade in EU with Russia, they weren't intended to stop trade in Russia with Russia. It was said it was an oversight, ofc Lithuania will take any chance it has to make it more difficult for Russia. Like any country that has Russia basically as direct neighbour. To prevent Kaliningrad taking advanatge of the situation they made that regulations that they can only import stuff in the same volume as the average of the last 3 years. Why create a scenario for Russia where they can escalate righteously? Rather show them how their living conditions fall, even with the tolerant sanctions, so they cant blame EU.

I think there are also German troops right now specifically in your country as part of NATO, and they are probably increasing them in the future, as they lack personell still. So when Lithuania gets attacked, Germans die. Lack of western values right?

6869398b24eb1312b560eee01a166b18,w3cmqv,igvsjeq,"Good question, allow me to answer with a little depth.

Nope, keep an eye on SW and S theatres (Kherson and route S to Melitopol) as others have mentioned.

Outside chance is something heading E or NE from Kharkiv as they've done it before and could cut of lines of supply to Izyum. But the amount of force required to achieve Kharkiv front is a lot.

But Kharkiv pales in comparison to Donbass and the East.

Ukraine will want to liberate as much of her territory as she can as quickly as she can, this only leaves Kherson/Melitopol where enemy concentration is very low.

This is further compounded by how much firepower and strength they have in reserve, which is still dwarfed by Russian power, at least in the East.

But Ukraine has precision systems, has demonstrated much better C3i (Command, Control, Communications and Intel) and has fought superbly to date despite asymmetrical disadvantages in artillery, air power and armoured vehicles.

Kherson and Melitopol are also opportunities for them to gain some momentum and experience for a lot of their newer troops, which they will need in future.

And finally, large scale ruses in 21st century warfare are exceptionally hard to pull off due to the strength of various surveillance systems like drones, planes and satellites.

Summary - not impossible but very unlikely, expect Ukraine to make an offensive on Kherson and/or Melitopol directions. Success, scale and timelines TBC, but their opportunity to do so ends sometime in September when Rasputitsa round 2 happens (Autumn (Fall) and Spring wet seasons turn everything to mud) and thus restrict wider manoeuvre warfare; forcing everyone to stick to formed roads.

**Edit: Some other factors:**

- Southern theatre if it can be entirely regained drastically reduces the size of the front, empowering Ukraine to concentrate on the harder to take areas later.

- Kherson is closer to West Ukraine and has shorter and more reliable lines of supply.

- Gaining as much territory back as possible sooner reduces the negative impacts for people in occupied areas.

- Partisan activity is remarkably high in the South, particularly around Melitopol from the information we have.

- Take all of this with a grain of salt; being able to understand military planning doesn't mean anything when we only have access to open source intel; Ukraine would have much better information IOT make their decisions.",1658296544.0,1658296172.0,t3_w3cmqv,t1_igvokcw,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

b89db0a1fbe2cea25fc576195e8576ec,w3cmqv,igw6g57,"I've seen a discussion point that suggests that the primary counter offensive might actually focus more to the east of Kherson, and the fact that Ukraine hit one of the two bridges crossing the Dnieper in Kherson with HIMARS (too light to bring it down, but poked a few holes in the roadbed) makes this feel more likely.

Simply put, the idea would be to attack further to the east, pushing straight down to the shore. This cuts a lot of valuable rail links to the Russians. Further, it avoids the risk that crossing the bridges at Kherson might result in Russia throwing enough cruise missiles to bring the bridges down, which would trap those Ukrainian units (the Dnieper at that spot is very wide and military bridging methods would be at their worst) and leave them out of supply.

What would likely happen if this occurs, is that to the west, Russia would withdraw from Kherson and drop the bridges behind them. This is useful for both sides really as it means the majority of troops along the river can be pulled elsewhere, leaving just a quick reaction force and some artillery to ensure that any foolish attempt at a river crossing is appropriately handled. Meanwhile the Russians would pivot east, while the Ukrainians could choose which direction to go. With the bulk of Russia's forces in the east being focused rather far away from this area, they almost certainly couldn't pivot for a counterattack. Especially as they can barely handle their gains with their current forces, trying to pivot would likely result in the Ukrainian defenders going on the offensive.

My guess in this situation would be that the Ukrainians would focus on pushing west along the coast and then down into Crimea. The (relatively) narrow front would allow them to maximize the force density at their disposal, meanwhile the entire approach to the mouth of Crimea could be easily supported by HIMARS strikes from across the Dnieper. Russia would be entirely unable to accumulate supplies for their defenders without a missile popping in to say hello.

""Worst case"" this would likely result in bottling up Crimea along a much easier to defend strip along the isthmus before pivoting east. Best case, but ultimately on a longer timeline, Ukraine retakes Crimea and puts a variety of anti-ship systems along the coast there to largely take the Black Sea Fleet out of the war. Even better, and what potentially makes this goal more likely, the whole reason Russia wanted Crimea in the first place was that Sevastopol is a warm water port. If Ukraine could take that before winter hits, that creates a SERIOUS problem for the Russian Black Fleet as their other ports for resupply and maintenance would be frozen over till spring.

Plus, there'd be the morale boost gained from retaking Mariupol as one of their earliest counteroffensive successes.",1658308613.0,1658306798.0,t3_w3cmqv,t1_igvokcw,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

But a lot of things that are said just don't make sense to me. He claims that Ukraine is suffering a 1000 casualties a day. Where does this number come from? This is far higher than even the most pessimistic number I've heard.

I can't judge whether Ukraine has enough to launch a counter offensive and he is not the first analyst I've heard who suggests they don't, but his categorisation of the weapons that are being delivered to Ukraine is just wrong. Some is old, but that is because that is material that the Ukrainians are already trained to use. The French Caesars and the American Howitzer are modern weapons that are still in production and the German/Dutch pzh2000 is the most powerful system my country's army has.

I do think it's correct that if NATO wants Ukraine to take back their land they need to provide more offensive tools and so far they've been focused on things needed to stop the Russian advance. And it's not been clear if they aren't sending more because they don't want too or they think Ukraine couldn't handle it logistically etc. So while the west has made assurances of support will it ramp up and adapt to the need of a counter offensive of will it be as defensively focused as it's been for now?

The Vietnam War ended in **April 30 1975**. It has been **17,003 days** since January 1 1976. During this period, the the U.S. has lost a grand total of **7,703** lives in war conflicts.

Russia has lost **~38,750 lives** in a mere **147 days**. That's **7 times as many deaths in 1/115th the time span**. Or put another way, that's a rate of **~0.45 deaths/day over 17,003 days** for the U.S. and **263.6 deaths/day over a period of 147 days** for Russia.

And if we for fairness of comparison extedt the range from 147 days to the same 17,003 day span, then Russia has lost around **115,377** soldier lives.  Or **~6.79 lives per day over 17,003 days**, as opposed to the U.S' **~0.45 deaths/day** during the same period.

But the U.S. also has 2.27 times the population of Russia, so let's account that by using per capita, in which case Russia has had **0.047 deaths per day per 1M present day capita** while the U.S. has had **0.0013 deaths per day per 1M present day capita**. A difference of a factor of **~35x**.

-----

**TL;DR:** Since 1975, Russia has lost more than 15 times as many soldiers as the U.S. during the same time period; or roughly 35 times as many if adjusted for per capita using 2022 populations. And the loss rate in Ukraine is, of course, nowhere near sustainable.

Conclusion: **Russia fucking sucks at war.**

Complete speculation on my part, but I suspect it may (at least in part) have been down to the logistics.  The only way the West could have supplied those Polish MIGs to Ukraine would have been for someone to fly them from an airfield somewhere in the West into Ukraine.

This imparts a not insignificant risk of Russia misreading the situation, believing something very different is taking place and escalating very quickly.  Even if they do not misread, there is a (significant?) risk that the aircraft will be targeted and destroyed as soon as they enter Ukrainian airspace (perhaps this risk has abated somewhat more recently).  Whilst very unlikely, it also risks the airfield from which the aircraft departed becoming a target for retaliation.

What started with intel and humanitarian support became NLAWs and body armour. And if some nations are giving those then some other handheld weapons from Europe's stores can't be considered escalation... Even if it adds up to tens of thousands of items, all small, no threat to mighty Russia.

Then Stingers and Javelins. No escalation here, just defensive weapons. 

Then some trucks and APCs, just transport, don't worry, no escalation to see here. 

How about some more defensive weapons, some brand new Starstreaks, cutting edge, but no escalation, purely defensive! 

Here's Poland with a handful of tanks, but the same model as what's already operated, nothing to worry about. And a few other bits and pieces, nothing Russia should be surprised to see.

Well if tanks are ok then a batch of short ranged small warhead drones aren't an issue, are they? No, of course not. Ukraine now has Switchblades. But just the defensive ones.

As you can see we haven't been escalating, just giving Ukraine the ability to project defensive capability to medium distances, no real threat at all. Speaking of medium distances, how about some Brimstone missiles and basic artillery. Of course Brimstone as well as being a missile that judges the worth of the enemy, can also target boats, boats are kind of ships, so really a supply of Harpoons is now justified too.

But you can't just throw equipment at someone, you need to train them, so obviously it's fine to ship a few (tens of) thousand troops to Poland, US, and UK for training. After all, it only makes sense as they are operating a few bits of Western equipment, defensively.

And if we are giving Ukraine artillery and training them on Western equipment, then they will obviously require replacements for lost artillery pieces, Ceasers and HIMARs should do, they are barely a threat to the superior Russian army of course! And if HIMARs are OK, then M270's are fine, as they fire the exact same munitions, just double the amount  of them coughcough.

But if Ukraine is operating medium-sized Western vehicles, without issue, then surely it's fine to train them to operate previous generation Western aircraft, just old stuff like F-16's, Russia couldn't possibly say that they were a thereat to their great aircraft! however few of them are left...

I did it because there were many 'do it ASAP' or 'it's not possible' and wanted to describe possibilities and probabilities.

The summary is I agree.

The most logical and simplified scheme of offensives is thus:

1. South and South West. Block off Crimea.

2. South East

3. NE (from Kharkiv). (Kharkiv forces have time and again demonstrated significant and speedy offensive successes and can likely impact supply lines)

4. East.

5. Crimea.

The retaking of Crimea is definitely possible, it is not densely occupied but it is hard and will require a large, heavily coordinated and combined arms effort to retake. That is far more easily conducted once other theatres have been concluded.

Who knows, doesn't seem that crazy strangely enough. When you look at the CAS missions they fly in their frogfoots, low altitude shoot and scoot stuff, where the major danger is from manpads and such, not aircraft. The A-10 would be very much an upgrade.

Try making some banners, sign, or protest gear.  You run into problems like wind drag.  Or a cop comes over and points out that traffic needs to be able to see around a corner and the demonstration permit did not include blocking that intersection.  Anything that you cannot hold by yourself means you may need to ask someone to put down their sign to help you.  How do you get your thing to the location?  

Visibility is key.  From what distance can someone see that the guy/thing is Putin.  If the table is a recognizable 10x bigger table than the Putin that means Putin is only recognizable from at most 1/10th the distance. 

When i see demonstrators i try to read the signs.  The effort itself proves i was not their target.  It is common to be unable to do it.  Text is too small and too busy.  If you slow down and look at everything you are endangering traffic.  A big sign with two or three words is best. 

Exception is when the target is not the public passing by.  A huge table could be used to blockade the Russian embassy.  Then the little Putin makes your barricade a protected free speech expression.  Big obstacles can help control and organize spaces or marches. You can also get stuck and create a lot of work for yourself.

Yes, Russia is highly reliant on rail. It's hard to tell exactly based on the information available but IOT target bridges you need a lot of firepower and it's likely you need a lot of range as you don't want to be in range of Russian artillery or air strikes while you do it.

I would guess a combination of both factors is at play. After being railed in things like munitions are kept in depots or stockpiles, UA can reach these and they are much easier to destroy which is what they've been doing.

The other factor is that as far as we know, Russia has spent a decent amount of resources opening up rail lines, and presumably setting themselves up to repair them too, at least in the East.

massive losses to himars seems to prove this wrong. Russia can't maintain and Ukraine hasn't even started an offensive in these regions

I mean except for pushing Russia off of Kharkiv and almost back to the border and all the gains around Kherson plus the massive casualities they have inflicted here as well with HIMARS that Russia has absolutely no way to stop.

That's the whole point of the cannon, to kill tanks.  They built the rest of the plane around it.  Pentagon analysts were worried that cannon wouldn't be effective so they required it to become this ""bomb truck"" you speak of.

Analysis after the A-10 went into combat against the tanks it was designed destroy, the T-72, the T-80, the BMP and BMD series of armored vehicles, showed the cannon was more effective than predicted.  

Can it outfly a Russian air superiority fighter?  No.  

Was it designed to be used in the exact type of combat being fought in Ukraine right now, against the same vehicles and anti-air systems?  Yes, but only after air equivalency was achieved, and in conjunction with dedicated SEAD aircraft in support.",False,1658356904.0,t3_w3cmqv,t1_igywr0e,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Compared to other military jets I don't think they'd be particularly hard to hit (being rather large and slow-moving), but they're also capable of remaining in the air with a surprisingly large number of missing or damaged parts.

I believe the design that puts the engine in the rear supposedly makes them less visible to IR from the front.  I'm not sure how much that actually helps against modern MANPADs though.  They're also pretty quiet from the front, and the supersonic gun means someone on the ground can get hit before they even hear the gun being fired.

It's an old design.  I think the newest A-10s were made in the late 70's or maybe early 80's.  They've been modernized, but they're still pretty primitive by current standards.

And, FWIW, many of the military commentators, early on, were almost solely talking about how Russia did not have the personnel to actually hold and control UA under occupation, as long as UA resisted.

Also, many were predicting a 20-year Afghanistan-type war between Russia and UA, where Russia overran and 'controlled' much of UA, with UA fighting back through guerilla warfare and underground resistance.

The predictions were always that UA would eventually prevail and Russia would be forced to withdraw, but only after a long, bloody, and painful conflict.

If you have time to search out some of the commentary and analysis from early in the war, you'll find it. IIRC, the narrative started shifting after Russia withdrew from Kyiv/northern UA, and everyone saw both Russia's incompetence and the UA fighting spirit.

Invasion of spain first and then the Russian campaign were his reality check.

Now he's just an intriguing historical figure, military studied his strategies for decades and his military genius mixed with a bold/crazy personality made him a legend. And it became harder to hate a legend.
