Day 27 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today we didn’t hear all that much incoming shelling if at all, but we do hear a lot of outgoing artillery fire from our army, it makes you jump almost as much as incoming shelling, mostly out of surprise, until you realize that everything is fine.

Our governor continues to report every attack being repelled and at this point I believe his words, as they basically mimic the sound we hear every single time. Apparently Russians tried to attack with their K-52 helicopters but didn’t manage to do anything. There is fighting going on in Izyum pretty much all the time, I personally heard reports of it being levelled in the first week, at this point we can expect that situation there has only gotten worse.

Also today when my grandma was standing in queue in a supermarket she met an old man, who said that he was in his 90s. He told her that when he was standing in his bathroom he heard some extremely loud sound somewhere nearby, when he got to his room he saw that his window is now broken and there’s a missile just lying here. He said that if he was in the room at that moment he would be dead now. 

What did he do after that? He threw it away through his window, nothing to see here, just a normal day. The missile itself didn’t have the warhead part at this point so there was no explosion. I can’t even imagine what it feels like to survive one Nazi invasion and then live to see the next one.

- This is worse than Chechnya
- 50% of troops have frostbite
- They can’t evacuate the dead
- Don’t have enough tents
- RU plane dropped a bomb on their own position
- One column was hit with Grad rockets. Can’t even figure out if it was friendly fire
- Medics only have bandages. Can’t help with frostbite
- No hot stove 
- Digging trenched to sleep in 
- Commander of 49th CAA told troops on 4th day that war will be over in hours
- Troops don’t have body armor. When one complained to commander was told “son, be strong”
- This special operation is a “madhouse”
- Being told not to destroy buildings - it’s insanity. Unless we destroy everything and turn into dirt along with the civilians, nothing can happen
- TV says we are moving forward. But we just drive through without clearing up villages. And now we have to defend from all sides because they are attacking everywhere
- They thought this would be like a parade ride

c6102eaa2d2626a3fd49dcff12302f44,tkcir0,i1r03vg,"There was a fascinating interview with Andrei Soldatov, top-notch Russian investigative journalist and FSB expert, in the New Yorker today: [""The Purges in Putin’s Shrinking Inner Circle""](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-purges-in-putins-shrinking-inner-circle). ([Non-paywalled link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322182601/https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-purges-in-putins-shrinking-inner-circle))

However, it's also *incredibly* bleak. I really cannot overstate how bleak it is. Some important excerpts below, although I really really recommend reading the article in full. 

---

Soldatov's opinion on what's happening at the Kremlin: 

>**""It looks like Putin is getting really unhappy with the operation, but it looks like he still believes that the original plan was fine but that there were some problems with some elements.** And that is why his attack on the foreign-intelligence branch of the F.S.B. is not just about bad intelligence but also about something else. . . . **it looks like now Putin is getting angry, not only with bad intelligence and the bad performance in Ukraine but also about the sourcing of the U.S. intelligence about the invasion, and why U.S. intelligence was so good before the invasion, and why the Americans knew so many things about what was coming.""**

On if the oligarchs and siloviki could topple Putin: 

>""Things changed, especially after Western sanctions were introduced in 2014, and mostly because of money. . . . And maybe back then [the oligarchs] could say something to Putin. This option was there.

>Now it’s completely changed because of the sanctions. **What happened is that Russian oligarchs, many of them, lost their contracts in the West, and Putin was really smart about offering them financial help by providing military contracts. . . . And that made many of the oligarchs much more dependent on the state funding.**

>. . . This is why the Army became so important recently, and it’s absolutely clear that the Army understands that really well. And the Army is getting more and more ambitious, and the Army has a say in Russian ideology, too. . . . So, all of a sudden, the military became really ambitious, and **I would say that now it’s not about oligarchs and siloviki, the current and former security-services people. Now you have the military and the military-industrial complex, and oligarchs are dependent on the military-industrial complex.""**

On whether the military could topple Putin:

>""[We] are in some uncharted territory. On one hand, Shoigu, the Minister of Defense, is a very shrewd politician. He’s been around for thirty years . . . **while we have had so many changes, so many political crises for thirty years, Shoigu always survived. But his thing was always to show his complete loyalty to Putin. It might be a game, but Putin believes him and trusts him and believes that Shoigu is absolutely loyal to him.""**

On the propaganda machine in Russia concerning the Ukrainian war: 

>**""The big propaganda win for Putin is that he and his media are still capable of convincing people that the fighting takes place only in Lugansk and Donetsk.** . . . **There are some cracks, but it’s not about more sympathy toward Ukrainians.** It’s more killed soldiers, because it looks like the casualties are really big in the Russian military. . . . **unfortunately, I don’t see any sympathy for Ukraine, which is a very hard thing to say.""**

His feelings about the future and a possible regime change: 

>""We are always trying to make these comparisons with the late nineteen-eighties, before the collapse of the Soviet Union . . . So maybe is it possible to repeat the same thing? I was fifteen years old, but still I remember that back then there was this cheerful mood that people were good, and it was just the system that was bad. **So back then maybe I was naïve, maybe my parents were naïve and my friends were naïve, but we had this idea that it was only because of the Communist Party and the K.G.B., and if you could get rid of them everything was going to be fine.** People are good. Even the people, say, in the military and in the security services. They were just pressured to be bad and to serve the system.

>**These days, unfortunately, we don’t have this excuse. We do have lots of people who support the war, unfortunately. Yes, I understand that it’s about propaganda, and it’s about fear, and people are really fearful. They understand what is at stake, and these select repressions were quite successful at freezing society. But, nonetheless, there’s so many people who support the war, and, to be honest, I just don’t know the answer. I don’t know how to get them back as humans.** . . . You have ordinary people, and people in the security services, and people in the military, and they are supportive of this war. And I don’t quite understand how we can humanize them back. I just don’t see a way.""

On Putinism and the support for the war:

>**""The war is a function of Putinism because it’s so aggressive.** Putin is famous for having no sympathy, actually. . . **[and] I think that’s what we have here with Ukraine. It’s just a manifestation of his complete lack of sympathy for other people.""**",1648005149.0,1648004617.0,t3_tkcir0,t3_tkcir0,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

#Ukraine Is Changing the World Order, Just not how Putin Hoped

Tuesday, March 22, 2022 06:54 PM 
By Marc Champion

(Bloomberg) --Two days after President Vladimir Putin sent his armed forces into Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published an article that assumed imminent victory. It celebrated “a new era,” marked by the end of Western domination, the severing of bonds between the U.S. and continental Europe and the return of Russia to its rightful “space and place” in the world.
As the war rages on, heralding the arrival of a single Russian World to unite Ukraine with Belarus and Russia looks at best premature. RIA Novosti soon took the article down. But the author was right about one thing: Putin’s decision to invade does appear to be changing the international order, just not necessarily in the way he planned.

From Berlin to London and Baltic capitals like Tallinn, the metrics of defending Europe have been torn up. A large scale war is no longer unthinkable and nations are reconsidering what they spend, what they buy, and how they would need to fight.


U.S. troops arrive for deployment to Germany, in Savannah, Georgia, on March 2.
Rather than split from the U.S., NATO’s European members have cleaved to it. Rather than shrink to its pre-expansion size of the 1990s — as Putin demanded before his invasion — the alliance is positioning more personnel on its frontiers. NATO has sent about an additional 3,000 troops to its eastern flank, as well as helicopters, tanks and fighter jets, to deter any potential Kremlin decision to expand the battlefield.

“No matter how this war turns out — and as cynical as it sounds now — historians will say that Putin’s attack on Ukraine gave Europe the time it needed to recover so it could confront Russia and, further down the road, China,” said General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the U.K.’s Joint Forces Command. “Ukraine is paying a high price to buy us time.”

The big question for Europe will be what it does with that time. Germany’s commitment to spend an additional 100 billion euros ($110 billion) is only the most obvious example of stepping up militarily, one that has implications for the balance of power within Europe, as well as with Russia.

Others are upping their defense budgets, too, including the three tiny Baltic States, which have long rung the alarm bell over Putin. They are also asking NATO for permanent bases, as well as long-range anti-aircraft systems, even if it’s less clear they’ll get them.

None of that suggests a return to stability in Europe, but a recognition of its loss. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine “is a post-imperial, post-colonial land grab,” Fiona Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council, said last week at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. “If we let this happen, we’re setting a precedent for the future.” 

Those extra billions can be spent effectively, or not. As the initial shock of the war and inspirational impact of the Ukrainian resistance inevitably fades, NATO’s unity and determination may do so too.

Putin may yet be able to achieve some of his goals and there’s every indication he may choose isolation for Russia — and permanent instability for Ukraine and Europe — over acknowledging his mistake. Defeat could call into question his political survival.

“It is still a race,” said David Shlapak, senior defense researcher at the Rand Corporation, a U.S. think tank. “It is a race where they have motivated us to start running, but it is still a competition that neither side is pre-ordained to win or lose. There are a lot of cards that still need to be played on the NATO side to figure that out.”

Shlapak was responsible for a war game Rand conducted after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, to predict what would happen if Russia were to invade the three Baltic states. The results made news headlines because they were sobering: Russian forces would reach the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian capitals in 60 hours.

In a “fait accompli,” they would also close the so-called Suwalki Gap — a land corridor that runs from the border of Belarus to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad — before other, larger NATO allies had time to respond.

It’s natural to be skeptical of such a lightning attack after the events in Ukraine over the past three weeks, but also too early to say what the war will change among the assumptions fed into Rand’s war game, said Shlapak. Russia’s leaders and commanders would surely go about an attack on NATO very differently.",False,1647982256.0,t3_tkcir0,t3_tkcir0,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Two data points for:

1) Agressive Russian letter

2) Possible destruction of documents in Russian embassies and consulates in Poland

Points against:

1) No relevant troop movements, NATO forces in the area outgun Belarussian and Russian forces, and Belarussian forces certainly aren't gonna do anything

2) Russia does not have any strategic objectives in Poland. No gas, warmwater ports, resources, access, etc

3) It simply makes no sense from any point of view at all.

A better read on the diplomats and bigmad letter: Russia is going to cut diplomatic ties with Poland, much like it already has done with the US.


> On why it makes sense (not morally, but strategically) for Russia to invade Ukraine but not Poland

Putin wants control over Sevastipol, a land bridge to Sevastipol, and if he was really feeling fancy he would love to have Odessa. Like, 90 percent of Russia's foreign policy decisions since the 1400s have been about that sweet sweet warmwater port so they could attempt to build a navy that's like, reliable.

It could also allow them to engage in maneuver in one of the theaters--possibly allowing an envelopment of Russian forces near Kyiv.

LVIV, Ukraine — Each night, Ukrainian pilots like Andriy loiter in an undisclosed aircraft hangar, waiting, waiting, until the tension is broken with a shouted, one-word command: “Air!”

Andriy hustles into his Su-27 supersonic jet and hastily taxis toward the runway, getting airborne as quickly as possible. He takes off so fast that he doesn’t yet know his mission for the night, though the big picture is always the same — to bring the fight to a Russian Air Force that is vastly superior in numbers but has so far failed to win control of the skies above Ukraine.

“I don’t do any checks,” said Andriy, a Ukrainian Air Force pilot who as a condition of granting an interview was not permitted to give his surname or rank. “I just take off.”

Nearly a month into the fighting, one of the biggest surprises of the war in Ukraine is Russia’s failure to defeat the Ukrainian Air Force. Military analysts had expected Russian forces to quickly destroy or paralyze Ukraine’s air defenses and military aircraft, yet neither have happened. Instead, Top Gun-style aerial dogfights, rare in modern warfare, are now raging above the country.

“Every time when I fly, it’s for a real fight,” said Andriy, who is 25 and has flown 10 missions in the war. “In every fight with Russian jets, there is no equality. They always have five times more” planes in the air.

The success of Ukrainian pilots has helped protect Ukrainian soldiers on the ground and prevented wider bombing in cities, since pilots have intercepted some Russian cruise missiles. Ukrainian officials also say the country’s military has shot down 97 fixed-wing Russian aircraft. That number could not be verified but the crumpled remnants of Russian fighter jets have crashed into rivers, fields and houses.

The Ukrainian Air Force is operating in near total secrecy. Its fighter jets can fly from air strips in western Ukraine, airports that have been bombed yet retain enough runway for takeoffs or landings — or even from highways, analysts say. They are vastly outnumbered: Russia is believed to fly some 200 sorties per day while Ukraine flies five to 10.

Ukrainian pilots do have one advantage. In most of the country, Russian planes fly over territory controlled by the Ukrainian military, which can move anti-aircraft missiles to harass — and shoot down — planes.

“Ukraine has been effective in the sky because we operate on our own land,” Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force said. “The enemy flying into our airspace is flying into the zone of our air defense systems.” He described the strategy as luring Russian planes into air defense traps.

Dave Deptula, dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and the principal attack planner for the Desert Storm air campaign in Iraq, said the impressive performance of the Ukrainian pilots had helped counter their disadvantages in numbers. He said Ukraine now has roughly 55 operational fighter jets, a number that is dwindling from shoot-downs and mechanical failures, as Ukrainian pilots are “stressing them to max performance.”

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has appealed repeatedly to Western governments to replenish the Ukrainian Air Force and has asked NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country, a step Western leaders have so far refused to take. Slovakia and Poland have considered sending MiG-29 fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots could fly with minimal additional training, but as yet no transfers have been made.

“Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address to Congress on March 16, appealing for more planes. “And you know that they exist, and you have them, but they are on earth, not in Ukraine — in the Ukrainian sky.”

Mr. Deptula said transferring these jets into Ukraine is critical. “Without resupply,” he said, “they will run out of airplanes before they run out of pilots.”

Pilotless drones are also a tool in the Ukrainian military’s arsenal, but not in the battle for control of the airspace. Ukraine flies a Turkish-made armed drone, the Bayraktar TB-2, a plodding, propeller aircraft that is lethally effective in destroying tanks or artillery pieces on the ground but cannot hit targets in the air. If Ukraine’s air defenses fail, Russian jets could easily pick them off.

As in other aspects of Ukraine’s war effort, volunteers play a role in the air battles. A volunteer network watches and listens for Russian jets, calling in coordinates and estimated speed and altitude. Other private Ukrainian pilots have removed up-to-date civilian navigation equipment from their planes and handed it over to the air force, in case it can be helpful.

Air-to-air combat has been rare in modern war, with only isolated examples in recent decades. U.S. pilots, for example, have not flown extensive aerial dogfights since the first Iraq War in 1991. Since then, U.S. fighter jets have engaged in air-to-air combat on just a few occasions, shooting down 10 planes in the Balkan wars and one plane in Syria, according to Mr. Deptula.

In the night sky, Andriy said he relies on instruments to discern the positions of enemy planes, which he says are always present. He has shot down Russian jets but was not permitted to say how many, or of which type. He said his targeting system can fire at planes a few dozen miles away.

“I mostly have tasks of hitting airborne targets, of intercepting enemy jets,” he said. “I wait for the missile to lock on my target. After that I press fire.”

When he shoots down a Russian jet, he said, “I am happy that this plane will no longer bomb my peaceful towns. And as we see in practice, that is exactly what Russian jets do.”

Most of the aerial combat in Ukraine has been nocturnal, as Russian aircraft attack in the dark when they are less vulnerable to air defenses. In the dogfights over Ukraine, Andriy said, the Russians have been flying an array of modern Sukhoi jets, such as the Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35.

“I had situations when I was approaching a Russian plane to a close enough distance to target and fire,” he said. “I could already detect it but was waiting for my missile to lock on while at the same time from the ground they tell me that a missile was fired at me already.”

He said he maneuvered his jet through a series of extreme banks, dives and climbs in order to exhaust the fuel supplies of the missiles coming after him. “The time I have to save myself depends on how far away the missile was fired at me and what kind of missile,” he said.

Still, he said in an interview on a clear, sunny day, “I can still feel a huge rush of adrenaline in my body because every flight is a fight.”

Andriy graduated from the Kharkiv Air Force School after deciding to become a pilot as a teenager. “Neither me nor my friends ever thought we would have to face a real war,” he said. “But that’s not how it turned out.”

Andriy has moved his wife to a safer part of Ukraine, but she has not left the country, he said. She spends her days weaving homemade camouflage nets for the Ukrainian army. He never tells family members when he is going on duty, he said, calling only after returning from a night flight.

“I only have to use my skills to win,” said Andriy. “My skills are better than the Russians. But on the other hand, many of my friends, and even those more experienced than me, are already dead.”",1647994221.0,1647992391.0,t3_tkcir0,t3_tkcir0,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

Zelensky says the only way to work something out is if he can talk to Putin. Putin doesn't seem interested in that either.

I think it might make sense for Zelensky to give up Crimea and the two other contested regions. Eventually, they can win them back when the time comes or when Putin is soon overthrown due to economic hardships.

> **Speedo cancel Rylov sponsorship deal after he attends pro-war rally in Moscow**
> 
> By Duncan Mackay  Monday, 21 March 2022
> 
> Speedo have terminated its sponsorship deal with Russia’s double Olympic swimming  champion Evgeny Rylov after he attended a pro-war rally in Moscow along with several other top sportsmen and women to show their support for Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, they announced tonight.
> 
> Rylov, a four-time Olympic medallist, including winning the 100 and 200 metres backstroke at Tokyo 2020, was one of eight Russian athletes identified at the rally hosted by Putin at the Luzhniki Stadium, the main venue for the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow and which also hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup, last Friday (March 18). 
> 
> He appeared on stage shortly before Putin gave a speech wearing his Olympic medals alongside gymnasts, skiers and figure skaters wearing the nationalist ""Z"" symbol.
> 
> ""Following his attendance at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow at the weekend, Speedo can confirm that it has terminated the sponsorship of Evgeny Rylov with immediate effect,"" Speedo said in a statement.
> 
> ""We condemn the war in Ukraine in the strongest possible way and stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, our athletes and our team-mates who have been impacted by the conflict.""
> 
> Speedo announced that they were donating the balance of Rylov's sponsorship fee to the United Nations Refugee Agency, who are currently helping Ukrainians fleeing from their homes following the attack by Russia.

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

 

The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

A Russian defeat will make possible a “new birth of freedom,” and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.

His misinformation campaign was and is hugely succesful.

Also some new heads of the big players( biden,scholz), evryone busy with covid for maybe the last time, him getting older...   it was a damn good time to strike.

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition.

Another interesting tidbit here is that troops in country are already grossly undersupplied to the point that they aren't eating unless they loot.

How much in supplies are they going to have left, and what's going to be left to loot in Eastern Ukraine in two weeks that's actually going to be edible?  

Even if we're talking about long term occupation Russia's bombardments will have a huge effect on the fertile soil that Ukraine was known for.

Just look up what Russia did in Syria, they have a track record, a history, of further brutality.  Many of the generals and other officers that Russia has sent to Ukraine have experience in Syria and Chechnya etc., and this is no accident, they were sent to Ukraine because they have experience in waging war crimes and crimes against humanity and they apparently are unbothered by these tactics and are ok with using them again. Putin's regime is truly monstrous on a historic scale.

This is Putin's longterm habit, his generals and his oligarchs and his henchmen and henchwomen, they are used to this stuff. It might still have some surprise quality for people in the West who haven't paid much attention to Syria or Chechnya, but its not new for Russia's military.

Still, the Russian military has been mauled and its stock of precision guided missiles depleted. Barring a catastrophic escalation of the current conflict, that should make a Russian war of choice with NATO less likely in future than it was before Feb. 24, according to Michael Mazarr, a former special assistant to the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.


A soldier walks in front of a destroyed Russian tank in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on March 14. 
For sure, in three or five years, Putin’s generals will have learned lessons, regrouped and rearmed, he said, but they’ll be hobbled by sanctions that limit access to technologies and finance. On Tuesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that allies would seek to tighten and expand sanctions on Russia when they meet later this week.

That, said Mazarr, is where the more worrying change to Europe’s security order comes in. Stability between great powers depends on reaching some mutual agreement to maintain the status quo, he said. That was achieved even with the Soviet Union after the 1960s, but never with Putin’s Russia. And, whatever the wisdom of NATO’s post-Cold War expansion, such a deal may now be impossible.

After Ukraine, “there is no treating the kind of regime that’s in the Kremlin as a geopolitical partner,” said Mazarr. “We are now locked into an indefinite confrontation with an increasingly humiliated, hyper-nationalistic and dangerous great power in decline.”

Concern in Washington has focused on whether China decides to help Russia evade sanctions and reequip, a move that would invite further U.S. sanctions and accelerate the world’s redivision into economic and geopolitical blocs. China has denied Moscow even asked for help and so far there are few concrete signs that it will.

In front-line NATO states, defense officials are less focused on Russian military snafus in Ukraine and more on the evidence that Putin can act on false assumptions.

“Russia wants to restore this Soviet type bloc of states in this part of the world,” said Brigadier General Riho Ühtegi, commander of the Estonian Defense League, a volunteer reserve of 19,000 adults and 6,000 cadets. “Maybe we are not next – there is Moldova and still Georgia, there’s a frozen conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and there’s Kazakhstan — there are many places Russia has to do something. But we have to be ready.”

Ühtegi said he’s received about 1,000 applications to join his force since the invasion of Ukraine began, half from women. He’s also planning to buy more of the anti-tank weapons and shoulder fired anti-aircraft missiles that the Ukrainians have deployed to such effect.


People walk through debris at the Retroville shopping mall following a Russian shelling attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 21. 
Most of all, though, Ühtegi is convinced that events have proved wrong Rand’s assumptions about how such a war would in fact play out in the Baltics. No doubt Russian forces would move quickly to the capitals, but the war would — as in Ukraine — be fought behind Russian lines and in cities. It would not be a done deal. “If NATO forces took a while to come they would not be coming to occupied territory,” said Ühtegi. “They would be coming to a war zone.”

The Baltics always believed Russia posed a military threat and were often seen as alarmist — if not paranoid — in capitals further west and south. However unlikely a Russian decision to take on NATO may still seem, Lithuania’s prime minister joined the country’s paramilitary force this month. But it isn’t so much in the Baltic States or Poland where the invasion of Ukraine is forcing a fundamental rethink on security.

In addition to Germany’s new fund, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to increase annual defense spending to at least NATO’s 2% of GDP target, from 1.53% last year — an undershoot that’s been a source of tension with successive U.S. administrations. Based on current German GDP, that would represent an annual increase of $21 billion, about a third of Russia’s entire defense budget.

Putin’s invasion has had such an impact across Europe because everyone suddenly understood that distance offers less protection in an age of hypersonic weapons and cyber, information and economic warfare, according to Barrons, the retired British general, who is now co-chairman of Universal Defence & Security Solutions, a strategy consultancy. “It’s a 90 minute journey,” he said, “and there are cruise missiles over London.”",False,1647982290.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1pkw8i,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

It drives me a little batty that so many analysts continue to not give Ukraine agency in this war.

The Russians are presented as failing ""because they are idiots"", not because the Ukrainians are outfighting and outmaneuvering them. But that's simply not true. The Ukrainians are much of the source of Russia's command and control and logistics issues.

Why did that 40-mile column happen? Because of the Ukrainians as much as the Russians! The professionals keep saying this and no one is listening.

What this sounds like is Ukraine was briefed on the Principle of Joint Operations from the US Military, which doesn't surprise me given that we've been helping train Ukraine forces since 2014. And given that they are a former Soviet state, they know the battle doctrine for Russia, which in order to see if any changes had been made they could look at Chechnya, Georgia, and Syria. So Ukraine officials knew how the Western armies operate and know exactly how the Russian army would operate.   


The big difference if anyone is curious is that Western Countries emphasis more decision making at lower-level ranks (i.e. those on the battlefield and not the CO in the rear) while Russia/Soviet style emphasizes preparedness, initiative, and obedience which means the CO has to prepared and informed to help control the battle.   


If anyone has watched Ukraine forces from videos posted online, you'll notice it's small squads of 5-10 soldiers together, with one objective and it's up to them how to get the objective done.

If Shoigu is really out, that is a red flag for the Putin entourage. Obviously, Putin will not accept a degree of responsibility for the Ukraine trainwreck, and it is logical that he would fire Shoigu. On the other hand, Shoigu is probably one of the rare people who was able to convey the reality on the ground to Putin. His dismissal is on par with not accepting that reality. People who refuse to accept reality often get stuck in negative emotions. Toss in some paranoia, and well...

Also, recall how he planned this entire invasion with apparently no one but a very, very small group of his advisors informed?

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

 

The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

> **It's a Golden Age for Armchair Generals**
> 
> By Matthew Gault
> March 22, 2022, 9:00am
> 
> People on the internet have a lot of ideas for how to manage Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some of them want a no-fly zone, despite the very real possibility that it will lead to apocalyptic nuclear war. Some of them think that regular Ukrainian civilians could disable Russian tanks with paintball guns. And yet others have extremely detailed tips for urban warfare.
> 
> Should Ukrainians ambush Russian troops in stairways with grenades? Should NATO impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine? Is the Russian military about to encircle Kyiv, or is it actually running out of fuel and heading for retreat? Will sending MiGs to Ukraine help defend its citizens, or will it escalate the war and lead to many more deaths? I don’t know the answer for sure, but there’s an army of armchair generals online who think they do.
> 
> There’s more information, both good and bad, than ever before. But the onus to sort through it is on the viewer. This becomes extremely hard during a war. The stakes are literally life and death, and all sides are willing to lie to score propaganda victories. In the unsorted mess of the Twitter timeline, a reply about mud from a guy cosplaying as Eisenhower online can move to the top of your feed as easily as a serious OSINT analyst who spent hours verifying the movements of tank columns in the country using satellite imagery.
> 
> The first round of mind numbing armchair general bullshit I saw started a few days after the war began, when ShitstachMcGee offered the people of Ukraine tips on urban warfare in /r/ukraine . Reddit removed the post, but it filtered to Twitter and exploded there. 
> 
> If you’re reading stuff like this from people like Rod Dreher and it’s making you nervous, just don’t engage. There’s a million clowns on the internet right now posting through a land war in Europe. The scary truth is that, despite a wealth of satellite imagery and constant feedback from the front, it can be hard to tell what’s going on and impossible to know how things will turn out. Pay attention to the journalists on the ground and the people living in the war zone.

> Everything else is just posting.

Civilian leadership decisions on military actions don’t happen in a vacuum.  They’re guided by military officials at every step.  

Even if you want to make the abstruse, incorrect argument that civilians point the gun and generals are merely the barrel, you’re missing the fact that civilian leaders have at the very least access to information that the public does not, which fundamentally informs their decisions; furthermore, they’re dealing with incredibly stressful, in-the-moment decision making with *real consequences at hand*, which is not something that you can relate to without direct experience.

“Armchair Generals”, on the other hand, are usually passionate about certain elements of the military: things like history, equipment, and theory, which are important, but provide a highly distorted perspective on current military events.  Furthermore, the term typically applies to people who have the luxury of endless time to criticize or speculate, but no accountability or consequence.  Meaning, a dumb soldier either gets smart or gets killed, a dumb armchair general can just keep being dumb more or less indefinitely.",False,1648000334.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1qn7sw,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

A ""military operation"" however, has a kind of technical connotation. It evokes the image of a surgical strike, of competence, of a quick action that delivers the intended result for a minimal price.

People don't like wars, but they appreciate skilled operations by their military. So that's why they went for the latter definition.

Of course, Putin very much meant to ""deliver"" a short campaign. Just a quick hop and skip into Kyiv, put up a puppet regime, crumble the resistance and call it a day. Instead he got a full out modern war of attrition with associated backlash and sanctions that is heavily affecting Russian society.

But because he is an authoritarian leader, he cannot be perceived as being ""wrong"". As any time an authoritarian leader is wrong, they look weak and they cannot allow that, as the only reason they are in power is because they appear strong and people fear them. So as the operation spiraled into a war, he had to continue calling it a ""special operation"", because that's what he called it to begin with, and to change it from something ""skilled and technical"" to ""dying soldiers and a fight for survival"" would mean that he had made a HUGE mistake. A mistake so large it may cost him his position, because if you are dumb enough to blunder into a months long war with tens of thousands of deaths, when you mean to have a three day victory lap, you're probably not very scary, or worthy of running a country, and people will stop being afraid of you.

All this is a good lesson for China which, like Russia, has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade but they have no combat experience. 

The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army air force, which has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership won’t delude itself as to its capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a move against Taiwan. 

So let’s not be prematurely defeatist. A Russian defeat will make possible a ‘new birth of freedom’, and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy.

Russia could encamp and shell/bomb from a distance and take minimal losses whenever they want.

The fact that Russia is still on the offensive means that Moscow clearly believes they can still seize more territory before going on the defensive and waiting out Kyiv. I suspect once they take Mariupol, they will be happy to wait out favorable peace terms if they can't break through the JFO area quickly.

Attacking and taking territory back from a Russian army on defense is *much* harder than defending. Especially since Ukraine's air force & air defense capability is degrading. (Hence why they want a no fly zone/more air defense so badly). Ukrainians really don't want to give up Donbass but realistically they currently lack the ability to mount an offensive that could retake it.

Moscow's economy is blasted by sanctions, but Ukraine is literally being invaded, a 10th of their population has fled, cities & industry being destroyed, etc. I'm not convinced waiting it out while their cities are being bombed is really beneficial to them.",1647988509.0,1647988279.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1pjq1c,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The reaction would be a lot alert status raises, but it wouldn't immediately be WW3 (so you know, you would probably have time to wake up, read the news, and then start panic buying canned food).

The question is what the Russian imagined planned for using them would be: the moment one goes off they need to have a diplomatic plan for it at least, because it essentially changes the hostage situation - Europe won't tolerate battlefield nukes going off along its borders, and the only option would be conventional NATO intervention in Ukraine, but that of course is hugely escalatory because functionally it's the end of the Russian invasion immediately if they're smart enough to realize how badly outclassed they are by NATO airpower.

The situation is a lot worse if Russia does something stupid like let one off and also open all (let's say some, since I imagine a lot don't work) silo doors at home since my heresay knowledge is that US nuclear doctrine - and the reason the US doesn't agree to no first strike treaties - is that if they think the situation is building to a first strike, then they launch everything immediately to get there first and limit the damage to the continental US.

Which is to say there is absolutely no happy story here. If Putin orders the use of nukes in any capacity, our fates go into the hands of the people surrounding him being smart enough to realize they *will* be turned into radioactive vapor within about 72 hours at best and stopping him.

Fortunately that hasn't happened: the much more likely scenario is he decides to have the Kremlin mix chemical shells into the artillery supplies and tries to blame the Ukranians.

>32.         Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent.  This has been recently illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm.  To face this evolving challenge, we have today endorsed NATO’s Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which will support NATO’s three core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture, and further enhance our resilience.  Reaffirming NATO’s defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.  **We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.**  Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.  We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.

This announcement was perhaps premature. And there is genuine weakness in the way the Western countries conduct business out in the open and in the way we conduct government out in the open. Putin is many, many things but he's not completely stupid.

The Kremlin had been operating in these countries for a long time (after all, they never left) and had been greasing the wheels of corruption in these places (and literally everywhere, in fact - their prime exports are oil, criminality, and money laundering) which slows down EU and NATO prospects. The Kremlin knows that it takes a while for a country to actually join NATO, and knows that a precondition of NATO membership is the requirement for ""stable borders"". 

So in August 2008 (not even *half a year later* from the above speech) Putin went in to Georgia and gobbled up two regions in a quick war. And in 2014 the same with Ukraine. Two regions again^[1]. This more or less immediately disqualifies NATO membership because their borders are not stable - a situation which remains automatically for some time no matter if the now-disputed land is ceded to Russia or taken back.

I am tired of typing this out, but the long and short of it is - I think it's complicated, but I think if any mistakes were made it was by the US unilaterally in that speech, or ... whoever ... not doing a no fly zone before the war broke out.^[2]


[1]: I still don't know why it's always 2 regions. Maybe it's the big enough so it's not so clearly just a military invasion, but perhaps to project some truth to the idea that it really is independence movements? Maybe to ensure you have a beachhead to fall back onto?

[2]: Arguably, because of the specific hardware Russia has brought to bear (namely the clusters of S-400s inside Russian borders), there wasn't then and still isn't now enough of the stealth air power/SEAD power in place to actually execute a NFZ in the area.",False,1647986598.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1pqdhv,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Let’s assume that they weren’t going to an urban environment where they could be picked off one by one around every street corner, from buildings where air support is virtually useless bc planes can’t hit what they don’t know is there until theyve already fired and moved 

And let’s assume kievs air defenses are completely gone ( they’re not) and the star streak and stingers aren’t there (they are), so the planes aren’t shot down quickly. 

And let’s pretend that the logistics and fuel that have been catastrophically poor the whole time are suddenly, magically better and they can be resupplied continuously. 

And let’s pretend that artillery couldn’t level the tanks before they ever reach the city limits. 

Let’s pretend those “1000 tanks” make it through the hedgehogs and mines and traps the Ukrainians have waiting for them in Kiev, and they make it to the city center.

f5d3237624ece774b938bc8212cd67c3,tkcir0,i1qed3i,"In January, the head of a group of serving and retired Russian military officers declared that invading Ukraine would be “pointless and extremely dangerous.” It would kill thousands, he said, make Russians and Ukrainians enemies for life, risk a war with NATO and threaten “the existence of Russia itself as a state.”

To many Russians, that seemed like a far-fetched scenario, since few imagined that an invasion of Ukraine was really possible. But two months later, as Russia’s advance stalls in Ukraine, the prophecy looms large. Reached by phone this week, the retired general who authored the declaration, Leonid Ivashov, said he stood by it, though he could not speak freely given Russia’s wartime censorship: “I do not disavow what I said.”

In Russia, the slow going and the heavy toll of President Vladimir V. Putin’s war on Ukraine are setting off questions about his military’s planning capability, his confidence in his top spies and loyal defense minister, and the quality of the intelligence that reaches him. It also shows the pitfalls of Mr. Putin’s top-down governance, in which officials and military officers have little leeway to make their own decisions and adapt to developments in real time.

The failures of Mr. Putin’s campaign are apparent in the striking number of senior military commanders believed to have been killed in the fighting. Ukraine says it has killed at least six Russian generals, while Russia acknowledges one of their deaths, along with that of the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet. American officials say they cannot confirm the number of Russian troop deaths, but that Russia’s invasion plan appears to have been stymied by bad intelligence.

The lack of progress is so apparent that a blame game has begun among some Russian supporters of the war — even as Russian propaganda claims that the slog is a consequence of the military’s care to avoid harming civilians. Igor Girkin, a former colonel in Russia’s F.S.B. intelligence agency and the former “defense minister” of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, said in a video interview posted online on Monday that Russia had made a “catastrophically incorrect assessment” of Ukraine’s forces.

“The enemy was underestimated in every aspect,” Mr. Girkin said.

The Russian forces’ poor performance has also surprised analysts, who predicted at the start of the war that Russia’s massive, technologically advanced military would make short work of Ukraine. Mr. Putin himself seems to have counted on his troops quickly seizing major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime under the Kremlin’s control.

“Take power into your own hands,” Mr. Putin urged Ukrainian soldiers on the second day of the invasion, apparently hoping Ukraine would go down without a fight.

Instead, Ukraine fought back. Nearly a month has passed, and Russian troops appear bogged down in the face of relentless attacks from a much weaker, though far more maneuverable, Ukrainian military.

“There was probably the hope that they wouldn’t resist so intensely,” Yevgeny Buzhinsky, ​​a retired lieutenant general and a regular Russian state television commentator, said of Ukraine’s forces. “They were expected to be more reasonable.”

As if responding to criticism, Mr. Putin has said repeatedly in his public comments about the war that it is going “according to plan.”

“We can definitively say that nothing is going to plan,” countered Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst. “It has been decades since the Soviet and Russian armies have seen such great losses in such a short period of time.”

Russia last announced its combat losses three weeks ago — 498 deaths as of March 2. American officials now say that a conservative estimate puts the Russian military death toll at 7,000. Russia says it lost a total of 11,000 service members in nearly a decade of fighting in Chechnya.

The failures in Ukraine have started to create fissures within Russian leadership, according to Andrei Soldatov, an author and expert on Russia’s military and security services. The top Russian intelligence official in charge of overseeing the recruitment of spies and diversionary operations in Ukraine has been put under house arrest along with his deputy, Mr. Soldatov said. Even Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who vacations with Mr. Putin and has been spoken of as a potential presidential successor, has suffered a loss of standing, according to Mr. Soldatov’s sources.

“The war has shown that the army fights poorly,” Mr. Luzin, the Russian military analyst, said. “The defense minister is responsible for this.”

The battlefield deaths of senior Russian commanders also reflect poorly on the Kremlin’s war planning. Captain Andrei Paliy, the deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, died in combat over the port city of Mariupol, Russian officials said on Sunday.",False,1647994541.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1qc695,,2,9,0,9,0,0,

But in response to the original comment, unless russia uses a mirky justification for some minor border skirmishes, then global nuclear strikes are more likely than a proper  invasion of Poland. If anyone is interested, the reasoning for the goes something like this:

The kremlin is not foolish enough to launch a land assault on Poland. They don't currently have the logistical capability for an invasion (as far as public knowledge is concerned anyway), so the only significant course of action would be ""pre-emptive strikes"" on military targets to stop Polands defensive posture and support of Ukraine. Those strikes would immediately trigger missile responses from Poland and almost certainly the Baltic states. And then NATO. That's WW3 and russia would not prevail, which they know. And so if they were seriously considering pre-emptive strikes they wouldn't use limited-target missiles in just Poland, they would use mass-destruction strikes in every ""unfriendly"" nation within range, probably nuclear. And so global nuclear war is more likely than a land invasion of Poland.

Firing into protestors also, but that has already happened in one place, but it's probably going to happen more and more.

These escalations will happen in occupied territories. In the general war, they can escalate probably just using unguided ammunitions on cities, but they have been reticent with that. Probably the Russians estimate the public opinion in NATO countries would become so enraged with the use of carpet bombing, chemical weapons and *certainly* nuclear weapons that this would prompt NATO to get involved. So they are avoiding that for now.

Personally I think a nuclear attack on Ukraine seems highly, *highly* unlikely, in part because there simply isn't a real ""target"" there. Throwing a bomb on a city will be met by universal condemnation, and I would imagine that even the Chinese and the Indians have something to say about that. And there isn't really a large enough agglomeration of an Ukrainian army to target either, nor does Ukraine posses an army that could even threaten Russia. So a nuclear response is really only on the table if NATO would put boots on the ground in Russia, *or* perhaps if NATO were to start enacting *very* significant losses on the Russian army which would threaten Russia to be unable to defend itself.

So really, we're kind of nearing the escalation ceiling in the current setting. They will try to sneak in more and more unguided bombs, but anything above that seems like a big risk for them for moderately little payoff.",False,1647993247.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1q8uaz,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

In any case, its mostly hypothetical because no military says what kind of ""electronic warfare"" its capable of.

This insane for a number of reason. For one Hydrogen is a miniscule molecule which is extremly reactive, and thus explosive. Which makes it a pain in the ass to manage.


And the second reason is that you would need electricity to convert water into hydrogen (assuming its green hydrogen), which is basically throwing like 40% ish of the energy straight out the window. It would be a complete waste.

Basically, well:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil\_shale\_economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_shale_economics)

>According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between $70–95 ($440–600/m3, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order for the operation to be profitable, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels.

Basically, Venezuela's economy has gone from massive deficits to profitability as oil prices swing because shale oil is expensive to extract.

Any economy that thrives on oil prices isn't relevant because their GDP swings massively from year to year, so they have to maintain large reserves of money to keep things going in down times, and Venezuela hasn't been good about investing in more stable industries (much like other oil powers).",False,1647998682.0,t3_tkcir0,t1_i1qmvxf,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

They obviously don't see Ukraine as a threat, there was never a chance of Ukraine invading Russia. It's all about stealing their land and resources.

Russia gives obvious bullshit reasoning for why they're doing what they're doing (denazification? ridiculous). They have outlawed anyone even talking about the war within Russia, so their people can't be exposed to the truth of their terrorist actions.

If Russia uses their nukes then they are done, fucked. They know this but have to walk the line so they can continue to do whatever they want and invade sovereign nations with impunity. They also know that western nations won't use nukes first.

Whose name was Henry
Only to give you an idea of what an individualist he was
He spelled it H-E-N-3-R-Y
The 3 was silent, you see

Henry
Henry was financially independent
Having inherited his father's tar-and-feather business
And was therefore able to devote his full time
To such intellectual pursuits as writing
I particularly remember a heart-warming novel of his
About a young necrophiliac who finally achieved
His boy-hood ambition by becoming coroner

The rest of you can look it up when you get home
In addition to writing, he indulged in a good deal of philosophizing
Like so many contemporary philosophers
He especially enjoyed giving helpful advice to people
Who were happier than he was
And one huh

One particular bit of advice which I recall
Which is the reason I bring up this whole dreary story
Is something he said once before they took him away
To the Massachusetts state home for the bewildered
He said, ""Life is like a sewer
What you get out of it depends on what you put into it""

It's always seems to me that this is precisely
The sort of dynamic, positive thinking
That we so desperately need today
In these trying times of crisis and universal brouhaha
And so with this in mind
I have here a modern positive dynamic uplifting song
In the tradition of the great old revival hymns
This one might more accurately be termed a survival hymn
It goes like this

When you attend a funeral
It is sad to think that sooner or later
Those you love will do the same for you
And you may have thought it tragic
Not to mention other adjectives
To think of all the weeping they will do
But don't you worry

No more ashes, no more sackcloth
And an armband made of black cloth
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve
For if the bomb that drops on you
Gets your friends and neighbors too
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve

And we will all go together when we go
Oh, what a comforting fact that is to know
Universal bereavement, an inspiring achievement
Yes, we all will go together when we go

We will all go together when we go
All suffuse with an incandescent glow
No one will have the endurance to collect on his insurance
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go

Oh, we will all fry together when we fry
We'll be french fried potatoes by and by
There will be no more misery, when the world is our rotisserie
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry

Down by the old maelstrom
There'll be a storm before the calm
And we will all bake together when we bake
There'll be nobody present at the wake
With complete participation in that grand incineration
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak

Oh, we will all char together when we char
And let there be no moaning of the bar
Just sing out a tedium when you see that I-C-B-M
And the party will be ""come as you are""

Oh, we will all burn together when we burn
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn
When it's time for the fallout and saint peter calls us all out
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn

You will all go directly to your respective Valhallas
Go directly, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars

And we will all go together when we go
Every Hottentot and every Eskimo
When the air becomes Uranius
And we will all go simultaneous
