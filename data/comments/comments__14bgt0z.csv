>
>GENEVA (15 June 2023) ‚Äì The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards today expressed alarm at reports and testimonies which appear to indicate that Russian military forces in Ukraine are consistently and intentionally inflicting severe physical and psychological pain and suffering on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war.
>
>This torture is allegedly being carried out to extract intelligence or to force confessions from detained individuals, or because of their former membership or support of the Ukrainian armed forces, Edwards said in a letter to the Russian Federation.
>
>‚ÄúThe alleged practices include electric shocks, beatings, hooding, mock executions and other threats of death,‚Äù the UN expert said. ‚ÄúIf established, they would constitute individual violations and may also amount to a pattern of State-endorsed torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.‚Äù
>
>The allegations relate to the detention of Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war held in grossly inadequate conditions in facilities run by Russian military forces inside Ukraine. In the letter, sent jointly with other independent UN experts, Edwards said that the consistency and methods of the alleged torture suggests ‚Äúa level of coordination, planning and organisation, as well as the direct authorisation, deliberate policy or official tolerance from superior authorities.‚Äù
>
>‚ÄúTorture is a war crime, and the systematic or widespread practice of torture constitutes a crime against humanity,‚Äù the Special Rapporteur said. ‚ÄúObeying a superior order or policy direction cannot be invoked as justification for torture, and any individual involved should be promptly investigated and prosecuted by independent authorities,‚Äù she said.
>
>Reports indicate that as a result of torture, ill-treatment and poor conditions of detention many Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war have suffered physical and psychological traumas, hallucinations, damage to internal organs, fractures and cracks in bones, extreme weight loss, sensory impairment as well as motor losses, strokes or the exacerbation of chronic diseases. Most individuals reportedly did not have access to adequate medical assistance during their detention.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,14bgt0z,jofvjpn,"On Feb 24, in Mariupol, 64-year-old Anatoli Voloshyn told his adult son he was going out ‚Äúto see what was going on.‚Äù He actually went up the territorial defense HQ to volunteer.  He went back home for supplies, woke his son up and told him he was ‚Äúgoing to defend Mariupol,‚Äù but a groggy drowsy son rolled over, went back to sleep, and wouldn‚Äôt see his father again, never remembering what was said in that groggy haze, or what became of the father.  The son stayed in the city for another three weeks at their evangelical church; with no word, he left Mariupol. 

For over a year, he wondered.  His two brothers and sister also wondered where was their father...

Anatoli was wounded almost immediately by a mortar while in a vehicle.  He had body armor, which he says saved him, but his ribs cracked.  At the hospital, he was again under fire by the Russians, and the hospital had to be evacuated to Azovstal.  There for two months.  From there, he went into captivity when all were ordered to surrender.  When the Red Cross collected data, he accidentally gave the wrong number for his son. 

When the mass group of several thousand came to Olenivka, the first colony set to house the POWs, Anatoli says it was discovered some of the defenders successfully smuggled in phones.  He called his son.  Heard his voice, knew he was alive, hung up. Too dangerous, could be intercepted. 

Anatoli says that the 900 Azov battalion soldiers were ruthlessly tortured, but he himself didn‚Äôt receive such treatment.  In fact, after moved out of Olenivka, he and several hundred other non-Azov POWs were sent to a facility in Luhansk, and the director was . . . unusually friendly.  As it turned out, due to needing to house them, a large grant came from Russia for this colony to be reopened, and all these locals were very happy to have jobs.  But most important, it meant that they couldn‚Äôt be forced into war.  He says the facility had got all new everything‚Äîlinens, kitchenware, etc.‚Äîthe new warden (also pleased not to be mobilized) was so proud of the new items, enthusiastically showing them off to the POWs, who feigned gratitude. 

Any news they had in Azovstal had been about Mariupol.  So they didn‚Äôt know what happened throughout Ukraine. The guards were the only connection to outside world. As it turns out, it became obvious when getting news from the guards, that some of the guards were quietly pro-Ukraine.
Local prisoners were also sent there, and they learned some of them were also pro-Ukraine.  For example, one guy was imprisoned for stomping on a Russian flag.  They were mostly kept away from the prisoners, though.  The director eventually got them a tv, but Russian programming was only thing available. Russian inspectors came to observe the facility and were very pleased to report back to Moscow that the POWs eagerly watch Skabeeva.  Anatoli laughs because, he explains, they would watch to see morsels of truth or good news that could be deduced.  (For example, that Kyiv wasn‚Äôt captured and the war continues bc Mariupol wasn‚Äôt the last holdout,* so much of Ukraine was still in tact and Zelensky is neither dead nor captured; the ‚Äògood will gestures‚Äô in Kyiv and Kherson actually meant defeat‚ÄîRussia could be defeated on a front?! but most uplifting was when the Russian shows railed against other nations‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt until saw it on Russian tv that learned that western nations were still supporting Ukraine, giving so many weapons, equipment, training, and this very much buoyed the POWs‚Äô spirits.) 

The other thing that buoyed their spirits?  Work detail for prison wages:  Making coffins.  They made 1,000 per month for the Russian army.  They loved it, for obvious reasons. 

Anatoli spent 10 months in captivity.  He was the oldest at the Luhansk colony. He left in a group of 78.  It was hard to leave behind other POWs, difficult to rejoice when know others remain captive.  His family is overjoyed that he‚Äôs been alive.  They had absolutely no idea he had even joined the TRO as a volunteer the first day, was at Azovstal, in captivity‚Äîthey knew nothing!  They‚Äôre very happy to be reunited.

>
>*A dam in Ukraine was designed to withstand almost any attack imaginable ‚Äî from the outside. The evidence suggests Russia blew it up from within.*
>
>Moments after a major dam in a Ukrainian war zone gave way, wild torrents cascaded over the jagged remains of the top. But the real problem most likely lay elsewhere, cloaked deep beneath the surface of the raging waters.
>
>Deep inside the dam was an Achilles‚Äô heel. And because the dam was built during Soviet times, Moscow had every page of the engineering drawings and knew where it was.
>
>The dam was built with an enormous concrete block at its base. A small passageway runs through it, reachable from the dam's machine room. It was in this passageway, the evidence suggests, that an explosive charge detonated and destroyed the dam.
>
>At 2:35 a.m and 2:54 a.m. on June 6, seismic sensors in Ukraine and Romania detected the telltale signs of large explosions. Witnesses in the area heard large blasts between roughly 2:15 a.m. and 3 a.m. And just before the dam gave way, American intelligence satellites captured infrared heat signals that also indicated an explosion.
>
>After the first section of the dam was breached, videos suggest that the power of the rushing water tore a larger and larger gash into the dam.
>
>As the water levels further dropped this week, they fell below the top of the concrete foundation. The section that collapsed was not visible above the water line ‚Äî strong evidence that the foundation had suffered structural damage, engineers said.
>
>In the chaotic aftermath, with each side blaming the other for the collapse, multiple explanations are theoretically possible. But the evidence clearly suggests the dam was crippled by an explosion set off by the side that controls it: Russia.
>
>Even in a war that has razed entire cities, the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam in southern Ukraine stands out.
>
>Thousands of people were displaced by flooding from one of the world‚Äôs largest reservoirs, which was vital for irrigating farmland considered the breadbasket of Europe. The disaster puts global food supplies for millions at risk and could threaten fragile ecosystems for decades.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-17-23/index.html

""Ukraine needs more precision weapons with a range of 200 kilometers (124 miles) to ""build up"" its offensive, according to a deputy defense minister.

""Ukraine is seizing the initiative,"" but in order to beat Russia, it needs long-range precision weapons, Volodymyr Havrylov said in a video posted on the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine's Telegram.

""All our military plans are being implemented in accordance with assessments. The main thing in modern warfare is to have situational awareness to know the enemy's position and to be able to deliver precision strikes over long distances. That is, to have weapons capable of hitting the enemy at a range of up to 200 kilometers,"" he said.

He added that Ukraine is set to receive aircraft that will primarily defend it from Russian missiles. 

""More than a year of war has passed, and we are confident that we will defeat the Russian invaders, together with our partners who provide us with everything we need,"" he said.

Some background on jets: In May, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were reportedly building an ""international coalition"" to help Ukraine procure F-16 fighter jets.

Since Russia‚Äôs invasion started, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has struggled to get F-16s to aid his fight, over fears they could be used on Russian soil, potentially triggering an escalation between NATO and Russia.

After saying Kyiv did not need the fighter jets earlier this year, US President Joe Biden reversed his objections by signaling to European allies that they would allow F-16 exports to Ukraine.

Last month, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed that groups of Ukrainian pilots have been selected for training in the UK where they will learn to fly modern fighter jets.""",False,1687007429.0,t3_14bgt0z,t3_14bgt0z,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

Biden recently authorized something like four hundred Ukrainians to begin training on the M1 Abrams, beyond the original that were pledged. With four tankers per crew, that's a threat of an additional hundred MBTs if Russia continues to escalate.

Many criticize the West for not doing enough, but it's often what we *don't* provide that serves as Ukraine's biggest strategic asset.

Title: She thought she was unshockable, then two castrated Ukrainian soldiers arrived

Sub-heading: Sexual violence against men is an under-reported part of the Ukraine war. A psychologist describes the impact on her patients of their torture by Russians

FOR a month the two men could not tell their psychologist what had happened to them, only that it was horrible beyond words. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs hell somewhere, it‚Äôs worse than that,‚Äù said one.

The Ukrainian soldiers, aged 25 and 28, had been in Russian captivity ‚Äî one for one month, the other for three.

After their return in a prisoner swap they had been referred to Anzhelika Yatsenko, 41, a psychologist in Poltava who deals with troubled young men. They were suicidal. The younger one had tried to kill himself. ‚ÄúI knew from previous cases they had probably been tortured,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAs someone who gets referred the hardest cases, mostly men under 35, it‚Äôs very hard to surprise me.‚Äù

When they finally told her, it was, she said, ‚Äúthe first time I behaved not like a professional psychologist‚Äù.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd never heard anything so horrible. I told them I needed the bathroom and went and cried and cried. I didn‚Äôt want them to see as they might think there‚Äôs no hope.‚Äù

The two men had been savagely beaten. Then the drunken Russians castrated them with a knife.

‚ÄúOne of them told me, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how I am still alive, there was so much blood, I thought I‚Äôd die of blood poisoning‚Äô,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúAnd of course it‚Äôs not just the physical damage. Imagine, they are young men just starting their sexual life and then in one second it‚Äôs all over. They still feel something, all these hormones, but they can‚Äôt do anything. They can never be sexually active. For a young man it‚Äôs the worst thing to happen.

‚ÄúTheir dignity has been damaged so badly and it‚Äôs impossible to forget. The Russians told them, ‚ÄòWe are doing this so you can‚Äôt have kids.‚Äô To me this is genocide.‚Äù

Their treatment illustrates the heavy cost of this brutal war ‚Äî one that is only likely to rise as Ukrainian forces try to breach Russian lines in the early stages of their counteroffensive.

Using new western kit, including German Leopard tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles from the US and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the UK, the Ukrainians have been trying to punch their way through parts of the 600-mile front line from Donbas in the east to the Zaporizhzhia region in the south, where they hope to cut off Russia‚Äôs land bridge to Crimea.

There have been many reports of Ukrainians insisting on returning to battle even after losing arms and legs.

Astonishingly, among those fighting is the older of the two castrated men whom Yatsenko has been counselling. ‚ÄúHe insisted on rejoining,‚Äù she said shaking her head. ‚ÄúHe says he‚Äôs needed and it‚Äôs easier being in a place where there are no women. I guess, given what happened, he wants to kill Russians.‚Äù

She has another fear, however. ‚ÄúHe may feel his life is worth nothing and just wants to die.‚Äù

Thousands of soldiers on both sides have been taken prisoner in the 16 months since the Russian invasion. Kyiv does not release figures but there have been periodic prisoner swaps such as that which saw the return of these two men. Last Monday President Zelensky posted a video to greet the return of 95 prisoners, noting 2,526 had been returned so far. ‚ÄúWe remember everyone, we are searching for each and every one of them, and we have to bring them all back,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we will.‚Äù

Yatsenko believes her patients are not the only ones to have been castrated. ‚ÄúThey told me the Russians performed the castration procedure very skilfully, as if they knew how to do it. And I‚Äôve heard about a lot of cases from colleagues treating others.‚Äù

Last July a sickening video emerged, posted on pro-Russian Telegram channels, that appeared to show a Russian soldier castrating a Ukrainian prisoner. The soldier, wearing the distinctive Russian Z patch, is wearing blue surgical gloves and holding a green box-cutter knife as he reaches down on a prisoner lying face down with his hands tied, his mouth gagged and the back of his trousers cut away. The prisoner is wearing Ukrainian camouflage. A second video appears to show the same prisoner shot, his testicles stuffed in his mouth.

‚ÄúAll the world needs to understand: Russia is a country of cannibals who enjoy torture and murder,‚Äù tweeted Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky. ‚ÄúBut the fog of war will not help Russian executioners avoid punishment. We identify everyone. We will get everyone.‚Äù

Whether or not the perpetrators are tracked down, their victims‚Äô lives have been irrevocably changed.

While there has been widespread international outrage and help for women and girls raped by Russians in occupied territories, there has been far less attention to sexual violence against men and boys, whether under occupation or in captivity.

Yatsenko said the men were hard to treat. ‚ÄúThey take a lot of antidepressants, that‚Äôs all. And we try to find some distractions for them. They can‚Äôt talk to their families or friends.

‚ÄúThe younger one who tried to commit suicide had a girlfriend who told him she accepted him as he was but it was too hard for him to stay with her so they are now apart.‚Äù

Last week she said he had stopped speaking.

‚ÄúThe other one had a girl he liked and planned to ask out but now cannot tell her. It‚Äôs all just so sad,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI will never forget.

‚ÄúOn one hand I feel rage, on the other it‚Äôs pain. When I watch videos of our Ukrainian soldiers I‚Äôm so proud of them, but then I hear these stories.‚Äù

Like many Ukrainians, Yatsenko has close links with Russia. Her father is Russian and she lived there, in Rostov, until she was 18, when she moved to Ukraine to study and never went back. They are no longer in touch.

‚ÄúThis thirst for violence is in Russians‚Äô blood,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI saw it growing up. They always hated us Ukrainians, abused our women as prostitutes. When I said I was going to study in Poltava, they laughed at me.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt beat us on the battlefield, the whole world is helping us, so they do this ‚Äî to demoralise us, to spread fear, to have this small revenge. It‚Äôs like blowing up the [Kakhovka] dam [on June 6], they can‚Äôt have Kherson so they destroy it.‚Äù

Doctors at the maternity hospital in Poltava said they had been consulted about women from occupied areas who had been raped by Russians then had their vaginas injected with window sealant so they can never have children.

Yatsenko shook her head. ‚ÄúI have a client from Georgia and she was tortured by Russians during the war there [in 2008] and fled to Ukraine. When war started here, she immediately took her kids and left, telling me, ‚ÄòI know what they are doing with young girls.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt understand then, but now I do.‚Äù",False,1687038971.0,t3_14bgt0z,t1_joif71t,,1,51,0,51,0,0,

See China's problem is that as a nation they have an incredibly fragile ego and therefore a huge inferiority complex. Endlessly tearing down any group they perceive as being better in any way, regularly bullshitting about whatever they have to to make themselves look good. The Great Firewall exists mostly so they can pretend to be superior too everyone else without pesky facts interfering. But a nation that's poorer and weaker doesn't trigger their fragile fee fees. In fact it makes China happy to get recognition as powerful and important.

Russia, on the other hand, likes violence for its own sake. They don't want to be better than everyone else, they just want to tear down everyone around them. It's nihilism and psychopathy. Vodka fueled despair. To them weaker nations are just targets.

DIVAD was supposed to spot the target and fire within 8 seconds of it popping into range 3000 meters away. It would fire a 40 round burst with a 50% chance of hitting the target. Several interesting products were developed, and a version of the Gepatd was submitted, but the chosen one couldn‚Äôt spot a helicopter near trees with radar, and took 10 seconds to acquire a hovering target and fire, and up to 19 seconds for a fast moving target.

Yes. Multiple, though, is not ""hundreds out of only 2500"" returned POWs. That would be rate of castration of approximately 4%. It would mean that in every group of 25 people captured, at least one of them gets castrated.
