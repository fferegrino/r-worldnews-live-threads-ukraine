Of the $44.5 billion the United States has appropriated for manufacturing arms destined for Ukraine or replenishing donated U.S. stocks, the Defense Department to date has finalized contracts to produce weapons costing roughly $18.2 billion, or 40.8 percent of that total.
>
>To Cook and other industry experts, that ratio, as modest as it appears, is an achievement for the military’s often slow, unwieldy acquisitions system, in which concluding a major contract often takes up to 16 months — let alone manufacturing a piece of complex equipment for use in battle.
>
>Pentagon officials say the eventual value of Ukraine-related contracts concluded through Aug. 18 will be substantially higher than the $18.2 billion figure, largely because it doesn’t account for contracts that give companies about half the expected value up front, with additional costs finalized later.
>
>Experts say the United States, as it invests in expanding the production of munitions, drones, air-defense missiles and other arms that Ukraine needs, also must ensure that it can sustain expanded capacity as requirements evolve.
>
>…
>
>Since February 2022, the Pentagon has concluded $2.26 billion of manufacturing contracts for the 155mm round, helping to increase U.S. output from 14,000 units a month before Russia’s invasion to around 20,000 per month today. Production is slated soon to reach 28,000 a month, with the goal of producing 1 million shells a year by fall 2025. Officials declined to say what share of that would go to Ukraine vs. being held in reserve in the United States.
>
>…
>
>Although Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive is just months old, defense officials are already looking toward winter, when a potential lull in fighting could, as one official described, permit U.S. and allied production “to catch up and help sustain them.” But Moscow will not be static, either: A break could allow Russian forces also to rearm and harden their defensive lines.
>
>The war has been a wake-up call for Ukraine’s backers across the West, where officials see an urgent need to augment their own munitions stockpiles. NATO officials have wondered how long the Western alliance could sustain a major conventional war. “No one had really asked themselves the question, well, what if ‘day one, night one’ becomes ‘week two, week three, week four?’” British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said last month.
>
>…
>
>Wormuth, without providing details, said the United States would aim also to set its artillery reserves as a higher level. “One of the lessons learned out of the Ukrainian experience is we need to go back and revisit those minimum standards. And we may have underestimated,” she told reporters this month.
>
>Officials note that some contracts signed to replenish U.S. supplies or produce specific weapons for Ukraine have been finalized in 30 days or less, including deals to make Switchblade and Phoenix Ghost loitering drones and NASAM air defense systems. They also are employing, for the first time, multiyear contracts for munitions.
>
>Restocking the U.S. arsenal will require finding basic weapons-making materials, experts say, a problem complicated by a global scarcity of chemicals and explosives. The United States no longer produces TNT and has since moved to a substitute called IMX, an explosive that provides power with less risk of accidental detonation.
>
>“We’re all relearning what it means to do mass production of ammunition, which had become a ... nonstarter” for many NATO members, Grand said.
Grand attributed some European countries’ paltry ammunition stockpiles to the preference for funneling limited defense funds to big-ticket items such as jets and main battle tanks.
>
>“No defense minister would put on a T-shirt saying ‘I bought stockpiles and spare parts,’” Grand said. “They all want to be the guy who said, ‘I bought the last fighter aircraft.’”
>
>European nations are trying to remedy that problem. This summer, the European Union approved a three-track plan ultimately to produce 650,000 rounds of large-caliber ammunition a year and committed itself to delivering 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition for Ukraine in a joint effort within the next 12 months.

>*Despite tough fighting and heavy casualties, Ukrainian commanders say their forces are in better shape now than just months ago, while Russian troops appear worse off.*  
>  
>In 18 months of war, Ukrainian land has mostly changed hands in sudden bursts, with Russia snatching a mass of territory at the start and Ukraine recapturing chunks in dramatic counterattacks. Now 10 weeks into its most ambitious counteroffensive, with heavy casualties and equipment losses, questions have been growing about whether Ukraine can punch through Russian lines.

>“If a year ago we were conducting defensive operations and we had the task of holding back the enemy, now we have the ability to attack,” Col. Dmytro Lysiuk, commander of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, said in an interview in his frontline bunker last week.  
>  
>Ukrainian officers are almost invariably upbeat in interviews. Even if the counteroffensive has yielded only mixed results so far, with Ukrainian troops slowed by dense Russian minefields and sustained firepower, they describe previous periods as being tougher than this one.  
>  
>Their optimism is tempered by the deepening realization that the war looks likely to continue at least a couple of years more. Some commanders even talk of a permanent state of conflict.  
>  
>But Colonel Lysiuk and other leaders interviewed in recent weeks point to what they describe as a number of encouraging changes. Their units are better trained and equipped than ever, thanks to billions of dollars of Western aid.  
>  
>They have worked out how to manage the training of fresh soldiers and how to keep replenishing their ranks after losses, even while continuing to fight. Almost every unit has grown in professionalism and size: Battalions have turned into brigades, and volunteer groups into formal army units.  
>  
>Longer-range Western artillery and, in particular, the cluster munitions recently provided by the United States, with some controversy, have been proving effective in destroying not only concentrations of Russian troops but also Russian armor and artillery systems.  
>

>  
>“They can’t approach closer, or they will be destroyed,” said Lt. Ashot Arutiunian, the head of a drone unit of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army. Russia has resorted to other weapons, using more aviation bombs and missile strikes as a result, he said.

>He showed video from his drones revealing damaged Russian armor. Vast craters gouged out of the earth by Russian aerial bombs and S300 missiles are visible in Ukrainian settlements all along the front line, where they have ripped up roads and smashed next to medical centers.  
>  
>Even if it does not recapture territory quickly, the counteroffensive signals a shift of perspective for Ukrainian fighters.  
>  
>For more than a year, units like the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade were ordered to hold the line along the Zaporizhzhia front, often a grim task of defending trenches and fortified positions under constant bombardment. Colonel Lysiuk was charged with rebuilding the brigade after it had taken heavy losses and lost its commander in December. It was back on operations in a week.

>For months last year, Ukraine talked up its counteroffensive in the southern Kherson region and then surprised the world, and many of its own troops, with a sudden breach of Russian lines in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.

>  
>...  
>  
>Most Ukrainian commanders said their leaders had shown far more concern for the lives of their men than the Russian command for its troops. A few said hesitancy sometimes actually cost more Ukrainian lives.  
>  
>A special operations forces officer, Oleksii, whose unit lost 15 men in four days of failed assaults on one village at the start of the counteroffensive, said, “If we had had harsher orders, that we had no option, we had to take the village, we would have.”  
>  
>Instead, commanders delayed the operation, giving the Russians time to mine the trenches, he said. Then, when the first assault ran into difficulty, the commanders pulled back to regroup instead of sending in reinforcements.  
>  
>“If you did it in one push, you would succeed and lose less people,” he said. “They thought, ‘we will try and lose less people,’ and now almost our whole group is in the hospital.”  
>  
>How long such losses can be sustained by both sides may now prove critical to the war’s future course. Russia can draw from a population more than three times as large, but Ukrainian commanders repeatedly pointed to a crucial difference between the two sides: They were fighting to save their country.

For newcomers, this is an amateur's take on the ISW daily bullet points. I know nothing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Russian forces launched a missile strike during the day on August 19 targeting Chernihiv City center after carrying out a series of Shahed drone strikes overnight.

Animals. 

What is even the point of this? Yes, I'm aware ISW thinks the goal is to 'demoralize the civilian population' but that's just because they have no clue either. At least the assaults on Ukraine's energy grid last winter had a *modicum* of strategy. This is self-defeating barbarism. Those Shahed drones could have gone literally anywhere else and done more good, even sitting in a warehouse until they had enough to fulfill some tactical purpose. 

>Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted a drone strike on Soltsy airbase in Novgorod Oblast and reportedly damaged strategic aircraft on August 19.

And this is what Russia could be doing with their drones. Where's your ammo explosions, Putin? Why aren't you throwing them at Ukraine's artillery tubes? Is it because your intelligence is shit and you have no idea where they are? Fucking scrub. 

With the strike in Novgorod Ukraine further demonstrated their capacity to consistently reach inside Russia proper. Novgorod is deeper than even Moscow. Putin can't stop these attacks. And those planes are expensive. Eventually Ukraine is going to point those things at supply depots *inside* of Russia, and between that threat and the destruction of that one factory last week, this is becoming an actual strategic bombing campaign. These attacks are only going to grow more frequent. The weapons used are home produced, so there's no geopolitical consequences for this campaign. 

Also, these drones are made from off-the-shelf products, paid for by financial aid. Everyone's looking at delivery of F-16s, but how many microchips did Ukraine import last quarter? I'm willing to bet it's a rough parallel to drone production. 

You know what doesn't need congressional approval? Circuit boards and dynamite.

>Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations on at least three sectors of the front on August 19, and advanced along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line and in western Zaporizhia Oblast.

Not a lot to say here that you haven't already seen on /r/combatfootage, only that it appears as if Ukraine is getting serious. This is no longer the corrosion phase of the campaign. These are honest to God assaults. We need to understand that while Ukraine certainly isn't on the back foot, their strength is not endless, and eventually they will exhaust themselves. Consider the scale of the offensives thus far: three (four, once Ukraine gets a foothold across the Dnipro) active pushes is a serious effort. This is the real thing.

>Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Chief of the Russian General Staff and overall theater commander Army General Valery Gerasimov and senior officers at the Southern Military District (SMD) headquarters in Rostov-on-Don on August 19.

It took Putin two months to muster the courage to step foot in Rostov-on-Don? What a little bitch. 

>The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) is continuing to set conditions to possibly replace Wagner Group forces with MoD-affiliated private military companies (PMCs).

Here's the problem with authoritarian regimes: they all eventually default to the feudal system. 

This is the old nobility-king balancing act all over again. It's partially a response to corruption. Putin is shifting the dynamic because maintaining something himself involves too many steps, too many places for corruption to sink in its claws. He's trying to shift the responsibility outside his direct purview by privatizing the military. The idea is that smaller PMCs will more efficiently spend their resource allotment because their owners have a vested interest in their upkeep, freeing Putin's regime to pay for results. If a PMC doesn't perform, then he just hires someone else. 

The flaw in his thinking is that he assumes all the PMCs will stay nice and controllable. He thinks he fucked up by letting Wagner get too big--that's the lesson he took away from Prigozhin's mutiny. In reality, however, he's setting the stage for a Russian civil war once the oligarchs realize nobody is strong enough to stop them from shooting each other over contract disputes. 

>Russian forces conducted offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line, near Bakhmut, along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line, and in the western Donetsk-eastern Zaporizhia Oblast border area and advanced in certain areas on August 19.

Another days of spoiling attacks...the push in Zaporizhia must be serious. 

>Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree on August 17 establishing the Donetsk Higher Combined Arms Command School under the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD), likely in an effort to further integrate proxy military formations in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Neat. It's not like that'll mean anything when Ukraine takes them back.

Soviet space program

*Managers*

- Sergei Korolev (1951–66). **Ukrainian**. He is regarded by many as the **father of practical astronautics**.[3][4] He was involved in the development of the R-7 Rocket, Sputnik 1, launching Laika, Sputnik 3, the first human-made object to make contact with another celestial body, Belka and Strelka, the first human being, Yuri Gagarin, into space, Voskhod 1, and the first person, Alexei Leonov, to conduct a spacewalk.[5]

- Vasily Mishin (1966–74). **Russian, Moscow oblast**. **Best remembered for the failures in the Soviet space program** that took place under his leadership. After the complete failure of the Soviet crewed lunar effort, uncrewed Mars missions, and the deaths of four cosmonauts, Mishin was fired in 1973.

-  Valentin Glushko (1974–89). **Ukrainian**. He consolidated the Soviet space program, moving Vasily Mishin's OKB-1 (Korolev's former design bureau), as well as other bureaus, into a single bureau headed by Glushko, later named NPO Energia.

Seems that some Republicans are starting to come out in favor of aide to Ukraine, which will cause problems for the US Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.  Until now most House Republicans have been either very vocal in their admiration of Putin or silent when others have been vocal.

For those of you that don't know how the US congress works, not only does McCarthy control committee appointments, but his office also controls the House's agenda, i.e. which bills get brought in for debate and vote.  

Considering the slim margin that Republicans hold in the House (10), the fact that he isn't well liked by the more right-wing, Putin loving members of House Republicans (which is why he had such a tough time getting elected Speaker), and that there is no rule or law that says the Speaker has to be from the majority party in the House, I expect there to be some more drama by the end of the year.  Especially if he has to stand with Joe Biden during relief efforts for his home district ([California's 20th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_20th_congressional_district)) after hurricane Hillary goes through.

Really, Russia is doing far worse now than at the start of the war. Yea, they were bumbling confused idiots then, but they're still bumbling confused idiots now, except they had a lot more equipment and better equipment before, plus they had Ukraine on the back foot not knowing the attack was coming. They still made **some** progress then, capturing Bakhmut and Mariupol after long sieges. Sure, they lost land around Kharkiv thanks to a rout, but that was just a one off.

Today Ruzzia is losing control across the entire front lines every day. And the places they captured were largely thanks to the much better equipped Wagner group, which are now out of the picture. Because of that they are losing territory around Bakhmut, which is likely the precursor to an encirclement.

Of course it's going slower now, both sides have had a chance to feel each other out for over a year and are both understanding what tactics work and what don't. The difference is Russia has nothing else to use at this point. Their best strategy is to try to rush with superior numbers in an effort to break through, which if Kupiansk is any indicator results in only minimal gains and massive losses, often with an eventual pushback in the week to come. Ukraine keeps pushing forward and while they make some missteps here and there they are never massive, and any gains they make remain in their territory. What's more Ukraine is making gains over heavily entrenched, reinforced defensive positions. Russia is struggling to make gains with its massive pushes over empty stretches of land. 

And even more telling is that while Ukraine's counter-offensive puts them in the role of the ""attackers"" they aren't having the usual 3:1 losses that are expected when an attacking force goes against an equally skilled and equipped defensive force. If you look at the losses of equipment Russia is still losing that by a factor of at least 2:1, sometimes 3:1. And I know it's hard to rely on those numbers when it comes to soldiers, but vehicles and equipment are a lot easier to verify, and if that's the case there it's likely the same for the soldiers on the ground.",False,1692533245.0,t3_15w0v9r,t1_jwyggd2,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Soviet space program

*Managers*

- Sergei Korolev (1951–66). **Ukrainian**. He is regarded by many as the **father of practical astronautics**.[3][4] He was involved in the development of the R-7 Rocket, Sputnik 1, launching Laika, Sputnik 3, the first human-made object to make contact with another celestial body, Belka and Strelka, the first human being, Yuri Gagarin, into space, Voskhod 1, and the first person, Alexei Leonov, to conduct a spacewalk.[5]


- Vasily Mishin (1966–74). **Russian, Moscow oblast**. **Best remembered for the failures in the Soviet space program** that took place under his leadership. After the complete failure of the Soviet crewed lunar effort, uncrewed Mars missions, and the deaths of four cosmonauts, Mishin was fired in 1973.

-  Valentin Glushko (1974–89). **Ukrainian**. He consolidated the Soviet space program, moving Vasily Mishin's OKB-1 (Korolev's former design bureau), as well as other bureaus, into a single bureau headed by Glushko, later named NPO Energia. While Energia and Buran fell victim to loss of funding after the collapse of the USSR, the **RD-170 engines and its derivatives are still flying today** and the experience in LH2 engines made during the Energia project would be used in later upper stages such as Briz.",1692532548.0,1692531762.0,t3_15w0v9r,t1_jwzd34r,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

They might not spout the absolutely ridiculous shit the Russian's say or use nearly as aggressive language but even democracies play the information warfare game. One of the biggest examples in this war is the constant will we/won't we over almost every new category of weapon systems that are being considered to be given to Ukraine. It is no accident that the issue of donating western tanks, cruise missiles and aircraft have been endlessly debated in a very public discussion between NATO allies.

That is intentional so that by the time it's announced Ukraine will be getting it the discussion isn't ""wow I can't believe they're giving Ukraine X!"" it's ""oh finally eh? Feels like they've been talking about it forever."" When it's already been endlessly talked about it doesn't seem like an escalation and that undercuts Russia's ability too cry about how aggressive NATO is.

That some of the debate around weapon systems are genuine differences in opinion between NATO allies only makes it all the more believable but no official or politician ever calls an accidental press conference and accidentally airs a grievance with an ally in public, not without talking to them about it behind the scenes first. Then we also have the times they've already been caught not telling the truth about delivery dates for weapon systems like HIMARS, training Ukrainian troops on US soil or not telling us at all like HARM anti radiation missiles.

They really aren't designed to work together. A lot of the advanced features don't work because the targeting computer the MiG uses doesn't support them, leaving the missiles in failsafe/fallback, or lower quality targeting modes. Switching to F-16s means that the missiles are being fired from rails with the correct connectivity connected to the computers that are designed to fire them, which means access to the more complex (and more effective) targeting modes.

The reality is that this year is the best year for Russia because they will only get weaker and Ukraine stronger. The main problem for Russia is that Russia cant help but lose Melitopol of they lose Tokmak and they cant help but lose Crimea if they lose Melitopol.

Even if Ukraine fails this year if they can make it, as they are now, even halfway to Tokmak it would not be possible for them to not reach Tokmak in 2024 with a stronger Ukranian army and a weaker Russian army in a fresh spring or summer push.

Lets assume the absolute worst realistic outcome for Ukraine and absolute best for Russia (aside of Trump). The Russian defendes are so robust that Ukraine must shift from an ambitious theaterwide campaign to end the war in a single counteroffensive to a yearly objective one. So we have Tokmak 2024, Melitopol 2025 and Crimea 2026, maybe 2027 if you use 1 year for the Kherson Oblast. This still sees Russia defeated and puts the entire Russia-Ukraine war at 5 years, 1 year shorter than WW2.

See, the main problem for Russia and why Putin depends on Trump to bail him out, is that Ukraine has a proper strategy to defeat Russia, it has military goals that would end the war and how to achieve them.

> In a briefing on July 22, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that U.S. President Joe Biden is not prepared to provide Ukraine with ATACMS, surface-to-surface missiles with a range of over 300 kilometers. Sullivan noted that, while providing the necessary resources to support and defend Ukraine remains a key goal of the U.S., another key goal is to “ensure we do not end up in a circumstance where we’re heading down the road towards a third world war.”

Which goes along with this:

https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/08/07/interview-why-wont-biden-hand-over-long-range-himars-atacms/

> Jake Sullivan, Yermak’s counterpart in Washington, has established very consistent contact, occuring on a regular basis. It is no longer just the two of them but also, as I recall, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, and the leader of the military forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. Negotiations are well underway, but Sullivan has publicly declared his opposition to such a choice [granting Ukraine long-range weapons], and he has reported his opinion to the President. There is one word here, Escalation. They are dragging their feet because the White House is afraid of escalation. 

> Jake Sullivan, in my opinion, has made a huge error. I believe this block is still in place due to him and numerous other White House aides.

They complain about Russia in Russia, but if someone outside of Russia complains about Russia, they will defend it vigorously out of pride and think others shouldn't shit on them. But they know themselves it isn't great, they just don't like people poking fun at them. Only a few were properly nationalistic, including one guy who went to rallies decrying the USA and was on video talking about how Russia can defeat anyone. This was back in 2017 by the way, not after the recent invasion. He was in his 60s, and doesn't know how to use the internet. All of his information came from the state news, and was pretty much taught that everything else was lies. Even that guy told me repeatedly how corruption was destroying the country. They also lamented that in the past, Russians would travel to China to get cheap products, but now Chinese go to Russia to be cheap products. They know their country is regressing. I've always felt that if they had free press and a different government, they wouldn't be like that, or at least not to the same extent. The government having total control of the information space leads to people like this. The government in Russia is awful and I hope it can be replaced in the future with a government which actually values the people in the country, even though I know that's not an easy ask.

Putin might do dumb shit sometimes.  If Trump gets elected it will have only trivial effects on the war in Ukraine for multiple years.  Ukraine has overwhelming support among the US military and allies.  Biden can transfer munitions ownership to NATO allies without changing NATO's defense posture.  The next president can rant about it.  Then (s)he has to reload the US inventory.  All of the arms manufacturers will be working on overseas contracts that were already signed.  The new POTUS can get on a podium January 20th, 2025 and declare that no US army or marine corps artillery shells are going to go to Ukraine.  That can be stated truthfully and also would have no effect on shells at the front before 2026 or 27.  

How many years does it take countries in western Europe to ramp arms production?  I dont know.  

We do not know who POTUS will be but Donald Trump certainly will not do anything predictable or rational.  Ukraine might have to sign contracts for a bunch of hotels and golf courses.  European allies might have to pay for Ukrainian advocates to stay in Trump's hotels while lobbying.  We are talking about a felon who cares only for himself.  In 2022 Trump suggested putting Chinese flags on F22s and bombing Russian forces attacking Ukraine.  We know Trump would sell out USA for spite.

My only worry is that maintaining those things might be difficult for Ukraine in the long term. Ukraine is still getting a lot of western support, but it’s such a fickle thing to rely on that pursuing a long term strategy like this carries the risk that it gets cut off or significantly reduced before Ukraine can really use it to outpace russia production wise. 

Similarly war support in Ukraine is not infinite either. The Ukrainians went for a ceasefire after crimea was invaded and the war in the Donbass went on for a while.

Nobody had wanted it to go this slow, and the Ukrainians have readily admitted that. They’re also not on an unlimited timeline and both Ukrainian willingness to fight and western support will (gradually) decrease as this war continues. Once again the Russians also have a similar issue, but they won’t give up just yet. 

So before insulting me, maybe consider that not everything goes well just because it’s the side you like doing it either.

1. The Meteor's max range is 110mi; the Gripen's max radar range (under optimal conditions) is 74mi.

So, it's really 74mi (120km) to work with. It's also only once successfully completed a BVR intercept of a drone, just a year ago, after 16 years of problems... until it's successful in combat, it has to be viewed with some suspicion.

2. Unlike the R-37 (you're correct that it wouldn't be effective against fighters), the R-77M has a similar performance envelope & range as the Meteor, but would receive the benefit of data-link guidance from AWACS. That said, any claims from Russia on performance & range have been highly unreliable going back to the Stalin days.

3. AMRAAM has been highly successful in real-world usage, & is compatible with both Gripen & F-16 (I wouldn't be surprised if they're close to integration with Russian-era aircraft after a year & a half of work).

Im arguing that, at worst, Ukraine will have to fight a mobile war divided in yearly goals. Ukraine doesnt need to outpace and outproduce the entirety of Russia's economy and industry. Only increase pressure on areas it already exist and mantain local superiority. For this it is only required enough qualitative aid like HIMARs, GLSDBs and F16s to destroy the Russian logistics in Ukraine and soften their defenses.

Ukraine does not need to produce or receive more aid than Russian factories can produce, only disrupt the logistics to keep what these factories send from being effective in the territory of Ukraine. January 2029 is the date Biden's second term ends and a Republican is almost a guarantee, so diminished support for Ukraine before that date is not very realistic and even a singlr major victory per year should be enough to keep support stable. 5 years is not a long war, is the reasonable average for such a war. A long war would be one into 10 years.

Note this is talking about worst case for Ukraine and best for Russia. In reality lack of rotation from Russian troops and Ukraine getting stronger from receiving more support and Russia getting weaker because of sanctions is likely to compound on the problems from Ukraine reaching any of those major goals.

For example, Tokmak would make the supplies to Melitopol almost untenable, this would be true with the Russian and Ukranian army as it is. Add this happening at a date when Ukraine has more aid, GLSDBs and F16s compounded with lack of Russian rotation and the chances of the Melitopol Russian defenses just crumbling and it falling the same year as Tokmak increase dramatically. Which also accelerate Crimea's chances for the year after that.

This is of course assuming an Ukranian failure in this year's counteroffensive, because if Tokmak is reached this year, Russia is all but defeated.",False,1692577362.0,t3_15w0v9r,t1_jx29iix,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Let's start with the implications of capture.

Tokmak is a centralised logistics point, 5 major roads link up in the town, and it has the *only* rail line to Crimea/Southern Ukraine heading through it (if we assume the Kerch straight bridge can be dropped) . A Ukranian capture of Tokmak means Crimea will fall in a matter of time, it establishes control over occupied Melitopol and the Zhaporizhizhia Nuclear Power Plant.

Bakhmut however, while it contains a train-line, represents nothing in terms of Ukranian supplies and logistics - it's not exactly a lynch-pin the Ukranians are relying on to feed and arm their troops. Losing Bakhmut has resulted in.... Nothing for the Ukranians.


So, let's look at operations in the effort to take these towns.

For Bakhmut - Russians threw *bodies* at Ukraine. Tens of thousands. It was an absolute meat grinder. Ukranians were able to hold ground and just chew through wave after wave of Russians in an organised and efficient withdrawal with relatively little losses. 

For the Push towards Tokmak? Ukranians are struggling to move forward due to minefields. They're not losing lives in the same way Russia was, they're taking their time and conserving the forces they can. Slow, methodical pressuring of Russian forces and supplies.


So, conclusions.

Bakhmut was a bloody and costly push for the Russians, that gave them territory of very little strategic advantage - so a Ukranian victory. 

Tokmak - ongoing. Much less bloodshed and casualties for the ground gained, but all in the effort to try and take very strategically important ground. Call it a stalemate at this point.

[See here](https://www.globaldefensecorp.com/2021/08/06/su-35s-irbis-fcs-a-soviet-era-glorified-phased-array-radar/) for a decent treatment of the subject WRT a likely enemy. AFAICT the matter of datalinks has never been discussed directly in public, so either you can't be as correct as you are confident or you are leaking as of yet unreleased NATO defense policy. I'll take the L here too for not having more well qualified my statements. 

That said given that datalinks are highly deniable and an absolute force multiplier I suspect that they will see some use, but of course can not prove that.  Lastly, you can view it with as much suspicion as you want but the people who buy weapons don't. However bureaucratic and European the Meteor's development, it has been widely adopted including the Israelis; who generally speaking have almost unparalleled access to weapons and tend to have very high standards. I am not saying it is impossible to make a mistake but I assume they have done their own testing and are satisfied with the result.

2. R-37 and R37M exist and actually are sufficient to scuttle missions if not actually kill jets, the most theoretically modern of the R-77 lineage were actually wrapped up in the MiG 1.44 project and appear to have dropped off the radar since then. Aside from a R-77 derived SAM with a extra solid rocket motor I haven't seen any of these clearly used or up for foreign sale. If there is evidence that that the R-77PD or any of its ilk actually went into production I would like to see that. Never the less you are right to be suspicious of Russian claims, even if their weapons are occasional in one or another regard.

3. The AMRAAM is an excellent weapon, no qualifications needed. However, if the US was comfortable with its capacities we wouldn't be doing work on the AIM-260 or the LRAAM. Long/Ultra-Long Range datalinked missiles are an obvious way to get more mileage out of mixed 4/5/6gen fleets and probably an important part of any future conflict. The Meteor is the first western long-range AAM since the Phoenix and the first one that has the endurance and maneuverability to take down fighter jets. I don't think it will hold the crown for overly long (LRAAM et all are very exciting) but I think it is, in this moment, potentially the best.",False,1692573654.0,t3_15w0v9r,t1_jx1o3f3,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

That means no real-time targeting systems, which is where the *real* value of what the F-16 can do with HARM comes into play - get into an area, find AA because it switches on the radar to pick up the F-16, but then the pilot fires the HARM and throttles out of the area to strike first and get out the way.

It's also possible that the missiles can be set to TOO mode and fired in the general vicinity of previously detected radars, but without knowing if there's a target they've actually locked on to, and using the missile's internal radar alone, meaning it relies on guesswork as to whether you've actually acquired a target or if you've just fired the missile at nothing, hoping it picks something up on the way, and with significantly reduced autonomous targeting capability to boot.

Truthfully, nobody without the right clearance knows exactly what capabilities Ukraine has and has not been able to integrate into the MiG (with rumours that Android tablets or Raspberry Pis have been used to effectively run an independent targeting system literally stuck in the cockpit that provides *most* of the full feature set but with substantially degraded user experience, as well as rumours that the system is a converter board on the Soviet type launch rails that fools the MiG's avionics into believing what it is actually firing is a completely different air-to-air radar seeking missile, granting access to some level of in-flight control), but what is generally acknowledged is that the systems are limited below their full capabilities and that this difference is significant, with degraded performance.

Most of our knowledge comes from what NATO members that operate both HARM weapons like the AGM-88 and also MiGs have been able to do... which is to say, not much.
