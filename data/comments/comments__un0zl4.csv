Day 77 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was slightly less quiet today, I’m not sure if there was incoming shelling, but our artillery has been shooting at something almost non-stop for the past 4 hours, and it’s pretty close to us too. There were some cruise missile strikes around Liubotyn which damaged a gas pipeline and some settlements are now left without gas. 

The fighting is pretty intense; we can see flashes on the horizon in the direction of Belgorod. Judging by how much our artillery is firing right now, another counteroffensive is probably underway, and soon we might hear about another settlement being liberated.

We still talk to some of our Russian relatives and “friends” and there is one thing that all of them told us when we said that our apartment building was shelled by MLRS. To not have to spell out MLRS we just called them “Grads” and what do you know? All of them said that it’s our own army that shelled us, and what is the explanation for it? Well, of course they said “we don’t use that old garbage (Grad)”.

Oh really, you don’t use Grads? Then why are there already 44 visually confirmed destroyed Russian Grads on Oryx’s site? There’s way more destroyed Grads than any other Russian MLRS. How would normal people, that have nothing to do with their military, even know that they don’t use Grads, and why are they so insistent on telling us that they don’t use them?

If you only heard regular Russians talk about their army and didn’t do your own research you would think that the only tank they use is T-14, the only jet is SU-57 and the only MLRS is Tornado-G (and maybe TOS-1A), but in reality most of their weapons/vehicles are ancient.

>China’s position to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine (including Donbas and Crimea) is a huge blow for Russia - this may mean China believes Ukraine could take back both Donbas and Crimea.  
>  
>Kharkiv direction - Ukrainian forces approaching and in some places reaching border in Russia - however, this means little - the war is already cross-border with 10 Russian BTGs in Belgorod Oblast and Russian shelling Ukraine from there.  
>  
>An option was offered to Russia to exchange Mariupol survivors for Russian captives. Arestovych receiving death threats from Azov fighters’ ‘wives’ - but these are most likely fakes.

>US lend-lease and a $40 billion aid package both arriving (and quite early), Russia is likely facing a very objective defeat with this in mind which explains their re-alignment of military goals with objective reality.

I have been entirely unable to ignore what I believe to be one of humanities dark moments and a massive shift in geopolitics that will likely influence how States interact with each other in the future.

When this senseless and barbaric invasion began I couldn't have been more wrong in how I believed it would unfold, and I can't tell you how happy I am to have been so wrong. The words we type here about the fate of strangers could never carry the weight of what they have felt and will continue to feel for the rest of their lives.

After the first week of combat I've been cautiously optimistic and fully admit to a clear bias when I hear Ukrainian success. I have seen dozens of Russian soldiers lose their lives on video and while I do feel sympathy toward their families, my perspective has turned apathetic to their losses as more reports of their cruelty, and the sheer display of the darkest parts of humanity.

I cannot bring myself to watch Ukrainian loses. There is something inside of me that hurts to watch people die for simply the right to exist. Azov Battalion had its issues, no sense in denying that, however the defenders of Azovstol will become immortalized as legendary. We simply cannot fathom what they have seen. Few people alive today can speak with any accuracy of the brutality, no written words can translate the pain.

Ukrainians both large and small have the heart of lions, they have done and continue to do what many thought impossible, every victory seems to bring dawn a little closer.

From CNN's Ivana Kottasová and Oleksandra Ochman

Crimean human rights activist and nurse Iryna Danylovich disappeared on her way home from work in the Russian-annexed peninsula more than a week ago. She has not been seen since.

Danylovich is believed to have been detained by Russian authorities, but they have refused to say whether, where or by whom she is being held.

""We assume that she is still in jail,"" Danylovich's lawyer, Aider Azamatov, told CNN.

Through her work as a citizen journalist, Danylovich has exposed problems in Crimea's health care system, including in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. She has written for a number of Ukrainian media outlets and has published her findings on Facebook.

Danylovich's father Bronislav told the news site Krym.Realii, a Radio Liberty affiliate, that his daughter planned to take public transport home on the morning of April 29, after finishing her shift at a medical facility in Koktebel, south-eastern Crimea.

Azamatov said the nurse stopped answering her phone at that point.

SIMFEROPOL, May 11. /TASS/. The leadership of the Kherson region intends to appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the admission of the region to the Russian Federation, said on Wednesday during a press conference of the deputy head of the military-civil administration of the region Kirill Stremousov.

""The referendum, which was held absolutely legally in Crimea, was not accepted by the world community, which did everything not to perceive Russia as a full-fledged subject of the world community. Therefore, it will be one single decree on the basis of the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to Russian President Vladimir Putin, there will be a request to introduce the Kherson region into a full-fledged subject of the Russian Federation,"" he said",False,1652263617.0,t3_un0zl4,t3_un0zl4,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

I know it's fun to imagine that happening (fun probably isn't the right word but you get my point), but any offensive into Russia would be vindication in the eyes of Putin. It would likely galvanize much of the Russian population and make conscription much more popular.

Russia doesn't have sufficient numerical advantage to meaningfully take over any city larger than Kherson obviously, let alone push through any defenses that Ukraine were to choose to hold at any cost. Ukraine has the space and the time to make tactical retreats, which has the added benefit of extending Russian logistical lines. Russia has demonstrated great difficulty managing their logistics beyond their own border so far this war.

Russia don't have aerial superiority, which also means they are unable to leverage their armored vehicle advantages. The terrain is also still not cooperative enough for heavy vehicles yet.

As a result, artillery is still the simplest and most effective way to conduct offensive and defensive actions. Russia has not overrun enough of Ukraine's strategic defensive depths in the east for them to really take full advantage of their defensive capabilities. Without those defensive advantages, they are unable to sufficiently protect themselves against Ukrainian artillery barrages during future Ukrainian counteroffensives. The Russians will instead have to shelter in the villages that they have already destroyed and are otherwise mostly deserted. No Russian wants to be in that situation, because it is not their own home that they are fighting for. The villages Russia has taken in the Donbas region are small, and have far fewer large buildings from which they can find shelter, compared to Mariupol.

The Russians are going to start being pushed back as soon as the counteroffensive around Kharkiv pivots east, accompanied by the new NATO artillery weapons that outrange Russia's own artillery.

It is inevitable that Ukraine pushes Russia back in the east to at least the 2014 border, and then they'll pivot to the south.

As for the south, Kherson is impossible to hold for Russia and Russia should know this. Even in Ukraine's worst case scenario that includes them losing everything south of  Kherson for good, Kherson will still fall if Ukraine wants it back. They just need to take down the bridge and it is game-over. Kherson may be ruined from such an effort by Ukraine, but only if the Russians decide to fight to the end... but why would the Russians decide to do that anyways? The population, what is left of it, is quite unsympathetic to Russia. The parallels with the eastern Donbas cities do not exist even remotely.

It would be very difficult for Ukraine to push south from Kherson should they ever retake it, and so that is probably why it is not a priority for Ukraine to retake Kherson right now. It would be better that Russia dedicates a lot more resources trying to hold an eventual lost cause, rather than be able to use far less resources holding the southern end of the Kherson bridge and diverting the rest of their manpower to the east.

As a result, the path for Ukraine towards retaking the south will come through Zaporizhzhia Oblast after Ukraine has dealt with the east. Russia will simply leave Kherson on their own once Ukraine starts achieving large successes retaking Zaporizhzhia Oblast, mark my words.

**We are not as dumb as you might think’: Ukraine’s foreign minister rues U.S. delay in providing weapons**

(...)

*Despite early shipments of anti-tank Javelins and anti-aircraft Stinger shoulder-fired missiles, the U.S. spent weeks looking at old Soviet stockpiles around the world to see what they could send to Ukraine, Kuleba said. “And then they finally came to the conclusion that these \[stockpiles are\] almost empty,” he said. “Ukraine will literally run out of weapons and ammunition shortly. So the whole logic had to be changed from ‘Let’s give them everything that you have in your warehouses \[from\] Soviet times’ to ‘We have to start the transition of Ukraine to Western weapons.’”*

*The turning point, said Kuleba, was two months after the start of the war — on April 26, when U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley met with the Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov and other officials at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base. At Ramstein, he said, the U.S. convinced European allies to “transition Ukraine from Soviet to NATO weapons.”*

""Russia is attacking satellites in Earth orbit that transmit and enable GPS signals, including in conventional smartphones.

Source : Western space chiefs in a comment to the Times 

Details: The Chief of the Space Command of the US Armed Forces, General Jamie Dickinson, said that Russia is increasing its aggressive actions in space orbit, undermining the work of satellites.

Russia is focusing its efforts on disrupting satellites and jamming the GPS signal used by planes, ships, cars and ordinary people. But they are obviously of the greatest benefit to the military, especially in the management of drones, the determination of coordinates for artillery fire and the operation of radars to track enemy equipment.


The US military has evidence that Russia is using technology extensively to disrupt satellite signals, thus exposing them to serious disruptions.

Significant failures in GPS signals were noticed by American intelligence when the Russians used their equipment around Chernihiv. 

U.S. military experts and military leaders noted the Russian deployment of equipment to mute GPS signals long before the February invasion. 

The Finnish authorities have confirmed that the Russians are carrying out similar aggressive actions near its borders. In March, Finnish planes flying near the Kaliningrad region and Finland's eastern border noticed interference with their GPS tracking devices. 

The intervention came shortly after Finnish President Sauli Niiniste met with US President Joe Biden to join the country in the near future.

According to General Dickinson, Russia and China pose the greatest threat to the security of the United States and its allies in space because of their active testing of anti-satellite weapons. In particular, Russia and China are launching dual-use satellites into orbit, which can be used for both civilian and military intelligence. 

Sir Mike Wigstone, commander of the British Royal Air Force, said that Russian satellites are constantly approaching the satellites of other countries in orbit. According to him, they are either spying on satellites or planning to do something much more aggressive.

In addition, Russian hackers are trying to carry out covert, small-scale attacks on the civilian infrastructure of Western countries, so that their involvement in Russia is difficult to trace.

On the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the cyber attack against the Ukrainian Internet structure was so large that it affected even the capabilities of the American communications company Viasat , causing disruptions for millions of users.

Heads of Western security departments warn that Russia's aggressive intentions in space are becoming increasingly apparent and need to be repulsed.""

The occupiers send school graduates to war and begin the struggle for redistribution of power
May 11, 2022

There are currently no signs of the Kremlin's intentions to end the war in Ukraine in the near future. Instead, attempts to carry out so-called ""covert mobilization"" continue. An active agitation campaign is underway, as well as the sending of graduates and cadets of military schools to the combat zone.

In a similar way, the landing units, which suffered significant losses at the front, are being replenished. In particular, from the scheduled for June 25 graduation ""Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School. Margelov ""most graduates are planned to be sent immediately to operational areas in Ukraine.

It is also known that in the war against Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces have already used almost 45% of the number of vehicles of logistics brigades (2600 out of 6000). The rest are trying to save for logistics in case of other emergencies. Currently, the occupiers are trying to replenish the fleet of vehicles by stealing cars in Ukraine.

The slippage of the ""special military operation"" was a catalyst for the intensification of covert confrontation within the Russian generals. In particular, in the General Staff.

Contradictions and covert competition between groups in the General Staff existed long before the war. But recent failures and attempts by other centers of power in the Russian establishment to place the full responsibility for the military on the military have led to a sharp escalation of the confrontation.""

The measure will next need to be passed by the Senate before it can go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier in the day that after the House approved the package, the Senate ""will move swiftly"" to get the measure passed and sent to Biden's desk.

Aid to Ukraine has been a rare bright spot of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill with Democrats and Republicans largely rallying around a call to help the nation as it faces Russian attack.

Lawmakers unveiled the bill text earlier in the day ahead of the House vote. The legislation the House approved provides funding for a long list of priorities, including military and humanitarian assistance.

The bill includes an increase in presidential drawdown authority funding from the $5 billion the Biden administration originally requested to $11 billion. Presidential drawdown authority funding allows the administration to send military equipment and weapons from US stocks. This has been one of the main ways the administration has provided Ukrainians with military equipment quickly over the past 75 days of the conflict in Ukraine.

**Kaliningrad Could Be the Next Flashpoint in the EU’s Standoff With Russia**

*(...)*

*Though there were local concerns about potential demands for financial compensation by former residents who had been expelled by the Soviets, hopes for economic investment from Germany led Kaliningrad’s business and intellectual elites to seek closer partnership with European institutions. These links were also fostered by the greater travel access to the EU that Kaliningraders were granted, including through visa-free access schemes. To the concern of state officials in Moscow, by the early 2010s, many Kaliningraders had become relaxed about their region’s German past and more familiar with the EU than with what they called the Russian “mainland.”* 

*These particularities of Kaliningrad’s relationship with its EU neighbors quickly came to be seen in Moscow as a threat to Russia’s strategic position in the Baltic. As Putin concentrated power in the hands of the central government in Moscow to destroy the ability of regional elites to challenge his position, the space for Kaliningraders to develop mutually beneficial ties with EU partners evaporated.* 

*(...)*

*While the Putin regime in a previous stage of its development might have handled such protests carefully, in its current radicalized form there is a strong likelihood that it might view dissent in a region of such strategic value to Russia as an existential threat and respond violently in ways that lead to further escalation. The extent to which a paranoid fantasy of Kaliningrad separatism backed by Germany has become a common theme in Russian nationalist and military discourse also opens up risks that any clash between parts of the region’s population and state authorities could quickly be interpreted by Moscow as a sign that EU and NATO states are planning to take advantage of Russia’s troubles in Ukraine through a so-called color revolution in Kaliningrad.*

Do they go right to the border and the dead zone is 30 miles into Russia and they are therefore killing Russians on Russian soil? Or is the dead zone located inside Ukraine to prevent Russian claims of Ukraine ""invading"" and thus avoiding potentially escalating?

So I was wondering about one potential reason of this: I'm not sure Russia did this in order to kill them, but I can see Putin using them as a leverage to reach some deal during negotiations. Because these poor people are in fact hostages.

So what happens if Putin indeed demands a part of Dombas in exchange of all those people? I mean, at this point this is something Putin could consider and in that case what are the options to handle such horrific scenario?

Refusing this deal, knowing that thousands of people (a lot of kids among them) would stay in Russia for whatever reasons, it's really an ugly scenario. Putin knows that nor Ukraine nor NATO will be in a position to try to rescue those people operating inside Russian territory, so what options left to solve this?

Back then, I wasn't interested enough in the article to click.  Let's just say I already knew that fake news was terrible, but back then it was just... surface level kinda terrible to me...

But gradually, it wormed its way in.  In the back of my mind, psychology-related dots started connecting and with every connection, the horror grew and grew.

Right now, my reaction to ""fake news"" is dread so high that I want to *kill it with fire*.

Have you ever wondered why it can be very difficult to... uh... rescue people who got scammed?

Part of the reason is ""not wanting to be wrong"" so like there's psychological pressure to pin hope that the scammer is not a bad guy.  (It's like abuse victims having little choice but to wish their abusers are actually looking out for 'em...)  

And then, PRIDE also gets involved ala a LOT of scam victims refuse to even mention about it because shameful, fear of losing face.  

Now, the silver lining to falling for ""fake"" money transactions is that ""wallet getting hit"" is such tough medicine that ""once bitten, twice shy"" provides pretty long immunity.

Falling for ""fake news"" though... there's no immediate ouchy ""wallet getting hit"".  Instead we get ""death via a thousand cuts"".  Example, Trump getting elected.  Or just what happened right now in the Philippines.

People who fall for fake news and wind up electing scammers to powerful positions (over their lives)... they'll be insisting for a long long time that they hadn't been fooled while (hopefully just their) wallets are slowly strangled to death.

The media is doing the public a slight disservice by paying attention to Transnistria. It's a **tiny** sliver of land with less than a million people. It only really matters a tiny bit from a strategic perspective because it's a client state of Russia and thus an enclave of Russian troops near the beautiful Ukrainian port city of Odesa, and because it's roughly as far as some would expect Russia would try to conquer without running into ethnic Moldavians and Romanians.

What Russia really wants and needs to be prevented from having is the beautiful, vital Ukrainian coastline. They don't really care about Transnistria itself except as a tiny frontier outpost at the very edge of their expansionist aims. Make no mistake, they want to conquer and subjugate it...and really have been doing just that by ruining Moldova's territorial integrity the way they did in the first place as the Soviet Union fell apart, but it's small potatoes compared to an Odesa, a Kherson, etc.

Ukraine is fighting for the right to have elections. Putin did not like their elections. In the USA we are also fighting for the right to have elections. At home, abroad, the conflict is pluralism VS those who hate plurality.

* Authoritarianism VS Democracy
* Populism VS Honesty
* Silencing Critics VS Pluralism
* Controlling Women VS Women's Rights
* Nativism VS Globalism, and it's bitchy brother State's Rights VS Federalism
* Autocracy VS Egalitarianism
* Christo Facism VS LGBTQ+

It's pretty easy to see how the Autocrats of the world have taken advantage of Globalism while stymieing Egalitarianism in the US. This allowed Populism to flourish, and with Populism, came the erosion of Democratic norms and gave increasing support for Authoritarianism. The naked lies of Autocrats and anti-Pluralists attack any honest person's dignity. It is is not dignified for the President to use a magic marker to etc etc. Taking away rights from people who are subdivided is easier than against those who are united, so these lying leaders lead us to Nativism and State's Rights, in pursuit of targeting politically vulnerable populations which would otherwise be illegal in a Federally responsible or Globally minded society.

I'm sorry to write about USA crap when this should be about Ukraine, but I think it is. If the Christo-Fascists gain power again, we will surely switch our support to Russia.

Honestly it isn’t that insane that they think they don’t use Grads. We’ve all been seeing the bullshit coming from Russian media about how wonderful the Russian military is. There is no doubt they’ve been made to believe it all because they have never seen the alternative. 

Even for me in Canada. I found out we were sending M777’s and I was excited we even had M777’s, then I found out we only sent 4. Then I found out that’s because we only have 37 in total so that was more than 10% of our M777 inventory. Fact is - I got this all from our media. I have absolutely no way of knowing if it is true, I just kinda accept it as fact. The advantage I have is that I live in a country with free media and not a media controlled by a genocidal sociopath.

that is, first Russian progress slows to a halt and UA holds the defense.

Then at some point, we start hearing of clashes between both sides, and we hear about the first small villages reclaimed by UA. My armchair opinion is that Russia does not want to lose ground at all(unlike UA which is happy to do a strategic retreat to trade ground for enemy losses).

So once these first villages are liberated, the Russian front is already showing weakness, and their line has been broken. UA still wants to move slow though, as it's foolish to go fast and risk losses and weak supply lines. so over the next week or two you slowly see more and more villages being liberated. until more or less the entire Russian front for that area is in shambles. At this point, 2-3 weeks after the first free villages, it's basically a rout, and UA can free up villages as fast as they can safely clear areas and move forward.

Again, not an expert here, but it feels to me like this will be the expectation for every front. While you hear only about small advances, the Russians are taking heavy losses. Then 2-3 weeks later, you suddenly 'out of nowhere' see a massive push by UA - but that's just the mopping up of the work done before.

Russia's main power on the battlefield comes from being able to bring ludicrous quantities of artillery and perform saturation barrages. Effective if indiscriminate, but it means Russian artillery direction requires clustered batteries of guns, fairly large target but obviously making use of tit for tat if attacked. Many things Russia has militarily are terrible, but the artillery is actually formidable.

Ukraine now has guns that can outrange the Russian models and their fire direction system does not require guns to be colocated. They can achieve above-requirement accuracy and fantastic Time on Target from guns of wholly different types in completely different places because they have some of the finest fire direction in the world. Combined with M777 and guided shells they'll out-artillery the supposed artillery masters.

AT4, Javelins, and drones were chosen as early aid because it only has a day or two of training.

M777 was chosen as aid because it only has ~1 month of training, and artillery is clearly an important weapon right now. Furthermore, an ""abbreviated"" training regiment can be accomplished in a  few days (maybe leave out MRSI training, or how to use smart-shells from the training, and focus on the basics).

I'm also interested in what the next steps are going to be. But it looks like any ""sophisticated"" weapon (ex: M109 paladin) has a much longer training time.

In fact, Ukraine does make domestic versions of Anti-Tank, Anti-Air and other missiles designed for different launch platforms and targets.

If the question is why do they not use missiles designed for one thing to use against another, the answer is that they occasionally do, but its difficult to make work. 

Modern missile warheads may look on film like they just cause a big explosion and that's it, but in fact their warheads use specifically shaped charges to direct the majority of the force of the explosion in a specific direction, usually in tandem with sensors that are looking for a very specific profile.

For example, the NLAW anti-tank missile in top-down fire mode directs an explosion downwards when it gets specific readings from its laser targeting system. It has a heavy, specifically shaped warhead designed to penetrate heavy armor. As a consequence, it moves relatively slowly compared to some other missiles. 

The Starstreak, on the other hand, is designed to take out realtively lightly armored aircraft. Its explosives are designed to throw three tungsten spiked darts into an enemy aircraft. These darts would not likely penetrate a tank, and would be of limited use against a machine gun nest. Its lighter warhead means it moves faster towards its target. Like the NLAW, it is laser targeted, meaning it follows the guidance of a person physically aiming at the enemy.

The sidewinder is designed for air-to-air. It has a powerful rocket propulsion system and is also highly maneuverable for a missile. It doesn't need that much firepower to knock out a fragile fighter jet. It uses heat seeking to find its target, meaning the person firing doesn't need to aim after they have a target lock - its largely automated. Heat seeking is relatively unhelpful in a ground-combat environment, however, as a slowly moving or stationary tank has a far lower heat signature than a jet engine.

Air to ground missiles also tend to be direct laser targeted, and have heavier warheads. Because gravity is on their side, they can have heavier warhead-to-engine ratios compared to sidewinders. 

I hope this gives you a sense of the problem. Missiles are technically extremely complex weapons that are carefully tailored to be optimised against one type of target. While they'll still explode if they hit something else, that explosion might not be well suited to destroy that target, the missile might not have the range or mobility to hit it, or the guidance technology might make aiming impractical.",1652276964.0,1652276086.0,t3_un0zl4,t1_i86ikmi,,1,33,0,33,0,0,

Then you're mistaken. Projecting your situation onto a foreign culture is not a useful exercise, although it does seem to be one that Americans love to perform. Local context matters.

Russian tactics are based on volume, where you employ lots of shells being fired downrange to saturate an area with fire.   You're basically employing a grid-style bombardment, where you state a general area as a target, and you go block by block across the map, and just drop shells , then move to the next square.

The advantages are that you don't have to train a lot of people in the specifics of pinpointing targets to lay down fire.   You're also denying an area to an opponent trying to advance, while you get your assault ready to push forward.   The disadvantages are that it requires a lot of manpower and artillery available to your army (which the Ukrainians can't manage as well), and that it eats through your ammunitions and supplies for what is essentially a 'spray-and-pray' approach.

The NATO approach uses smaller numbers of artillery per unit, but emphasizes precision and survivability over volume.   The structure of NATO tactics emphasize priority and precision in hitting where an actual target lies, so there's multiple levels of fire direction involved.   Survivability comes in being able to fire, move, and reset to fire again - the 'shoot and scoot' approach.  The advantage is multiplied by having the instantaneous flow of information from drones and troops that are being coordinated by the fire direction crews, so that accuracy and precise strikes can go up.  The Ukrainians have been doing this to some extent already, but with the proper equipment and training, we can enhance that effect.

The M777 is lighter to move, and requires less personnel to fire.  It's also easy and quick to re-align, which reduces the impact of the 'shoot-and'scoot' approach.  With the old Russian gear, that process is much more manual, which means you have to either expose yourself to return fire if you don't move, or deal with generally inaccurate and ineffective fire - neither of which the Ukrainians can afford.",False,1652283377.0,t3_un0zl4,t1_i86g89i,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

His remarks in a meeting with a bunch of investor types, libertarians mostly are summarized as follows:

________

Kissinger’s measured, diplomatic responses on how to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict presented a stark contrast to today’s divisive rhetoric. He emphasized the importance of giving Putin a dignified and safe way out of the war: “We need to give the Russians an opportunity to protect themselves [from NATO]—we shouldn’t turn this conflict into a purely technical, economic problem.”

He believes that we may be close to a ceasefire and thinks it’s unlikely that nuclear weapons will be used, “as long as the US or NATO doesn’t breach Russian borders.”
__________

Personally, I don't think Putin or Russia deserves anything but total undeniable defeat at a level where their textbooks can not twist the facts about how badly they got hammered.

Their citizens need clear, accurate, information that can help them understand just how completely they've been played by their leadership for generations. They need to understand that the only peaceful path forward is to drop all of the cry-baby, ""my pussy hurts"", whining about how they are perceived in the rest of the world.

No, it's not true. Journalists tend to be somewhat ignorant and imprecise when speaking on military matters, as the language is very technical and precise in a way most people are not used to. This can lead to some misinformation.

The United States has given away up to 1/3 of *some specific* weapons to Ukraine - specifically, it has given a large portion of its stock of Javelins and Stingers. 

It is able to do this without breaking a sweat for a few reasons. 
First, it can replenish them reasonably easily. It might take a year to four for NATO to fully replenish its personal MANPADs and anti-tank weapons. 

Second, if you're fighting the United States of America in an honest-to-goodness, no-holds-barred war, you really shouldn't be worried about the guy behind the tree or rubble with the javelin or stinger. You're worried about the several *thousand Abrams main battle tanks supported by many, many thousands of highly trained infantry, APCs, recce vehicles, armoured support vehicles, Paladin self-propelled howitzers, mortars and artillery of all kinds, ballistic missiles and the three largest and most powerful airforces on earth (the USAF, US Navy and US Marine Corps) with thousands more ready-to-deploy highly advanced combat aircraft of every description that the next three forces combined. 

Assuming you got into a conventional war with America where America really just wanted your army dead, and you got past the carrier groups, the armourd corps and enough hyper advanced aircraft and missiles that everyone can fight in the shade, well, America *still* has twice the number of asymetric warfare systems that has ground the Russian offensive in Ukraine to a halt. 

Long story short - don't get into a conventional war of any kind with the United States of America. What America can bring to bear on a few weeks' notice anywhere in the world is more firepower than the entirety of the Russian Federation on full mobilization. So don't worry about how many asymmetric warfare missile systems and spare howitizers have been shipped. I assure you, America has more.",False,1652317667.0,t3_un0zl4,t1_i89atmb,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

The Russians were trying to cross the bridge.

Ukrainians either saw this. Instead of attacking the Russians immediately, they wait for a lot of them to be on the bridge at the same time. Maybe Russia sent 2 or 3 tanks ahead to serve as the vanguard. Ukrainians were patient and waited for many, many Russians to be on the bridge.

When a large mass of Russians were on the bridge, Ukrainians attacked suddenly. The 2 or 3 tanks guarding the front were immediately defeated, and then the Ukrainians moved in and blew up the bridge.

The rest of the forces were swept into the river, and were then washed into the same spot, that we see in the photograph. We see burned out husks in the river, because those tanks / IFVs were fighting **WHILE ON THE BRIDGE**.

That's a LOT of ""popped turrets"". Artillery is good but it just isn't that accurate. You'd also see way more craters around the area if this was a massive artillery bombardment IMO.

> an aerial assault or an ambush by a mix of Ukrainian armor and infantry on the far side of the river?

More likely, but where are the Ukrainian casualties? A battle of this scale would have some dead Ukrainian vehicles somewhere.

------

I'm guessing something in-between. A huge bombardment of laser-guided mortar rounds. Not quite artillery, but still indirect-fire that's kinda-sorta like an artillery bombardment. Cheaper too (I mean, laser-guided mortar is still expensive).

That explains why there's so few Ukrainian casualties: because they were largely hidden commandos who were just laser-guiding the mortar.

4. Advances south towards Melitopol.

5./6. An attempt to liberate either Kherson/Melitopol, and then an attempt on the other.

Basically Melitopol is juicy strategically for the whole of the South and an advance in that direction will likely force Russia into a choice as to which to keep.

My money is on Melitopol then Kherson, but no doubt the situation on the ground will dictate everything.

This order is based on the idea of liberating pre-invasion Ukrainian controlled areas first.

**Russia is doing absolutely great.**

This is demonstrably not true. Russia has lost a concerning amount of military equipment, a concerning amount of soldiers and has failed in their key military objectives. Namely, to take Kiev, to kill or oust Zelinskyy, and to completely annex the Eastern areas.

Russia has also been disconnected from the Western banking systems to a large extent. They have lost the ability to raise western capital. They have been discharged from both the human rights council and the G8. Russian leaders from Putin down have effectively been barricaded in their own country and their assets frozen. Flights out of Russia have stopped or been severely limited and their ability to service the majority of the world's aircraft has ceased. Countries that never had any intention of doing so, are now seeking to join NATO urgently.

I could go on.

**Ruble has been doing better than before the sanctions hit**

This is a meaningless statement when the Russian stock market is limiting or preventing sell orders and when the currency is being heavily bolstered by Russian financial rescue efforts. On the streets of Moscow you cannot trade rubles for the exchange rate listed. What meaning then, does this exchange rate have?

**russian people notice nothing whatsoever from these sanctions accroding to interviews.**

Russian people are of course noticing a number of things. Namely that they are struggling to leave Russia. We have seen queues for basics like sugar and for luxuries such as Iphones. Popular restaurants like McDonalds are gone, as are popular western brands. Russian people are arrested for minor acts of dissent, including holding blank signs, or dancing in the street. Russian families are being lied to about the fate of their young boys.

So good job on those censorship crews on making this video. Enough to show M777 usage but maybe not enough to demonstrate tactics or identify the crewmen.

--------

Still, I'm a bit nervous even with them showing this much. But I acknowledge that someone who knows what they're doing has gone over the video and tried to hide tactical details.

But every video that comes out like this will ""leak"" bits of tactics, that all together will hurt strategy in the long run. A big mystery right now is the training of Ukrainian crews.

For example, USA's artillery crews are trained for an artillery shot every 12-seconds. Is Ukrainian training at that level, or is it slower? The more videos that come out with the speed of loading / firing the gun, the more and more the Russians will be able to figure it out.

Its safe to say that Ukrainian crews are going to be slower than USA crews. But what are we talking about here? 20-seconds per shot? 30 seconds per shot? I dunno, and its best if the Russians didn't know either.

------

A gun crew that fires every 10-seconds (6 rounds per minute) will effectively perform as if it were 3x guns firing at once-every-30 seconds. (2-rounds per minute). Knowing the training of Ukrainians will tell me this important difference.

That's a 100lb shell they're loading into that weapon. It takes strength and stamina to perform this task, and that strength and stamina is built up with practice and working out. Seeing how one or two Ukrainian crews perform will tell me the level of training all Ukrainian crews perform this task (due to the consistency of training across an army).

----

Lets say you're a crack Russian professional artillery crew capable of 6-rounds per minute. Intelligence says you're up against 2x Ukrainian M777 gun teams. Do you advance to take them on? Depends, do you think they can do 2-rounds per minute each (4-rounds for the two teams), or do you think they're better trained and can do maybe 4-rounds per minute each (8-rounds per minute) ??

The Convention resulted from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which took place between 1973 and 1982.

First off - it’s amazing that we are having this conversation at all. Not only is Ukraine defending, they are actually taking territory. And not just little bits - strategically important territory!

Putting on my best armchair strategist dressing gown, I think you’d do it in order of:

1. Territory that you need the most for supplies etc

2. Territory that is easier to defend

3. Territory that makes life hard for the enemy

4. Territory that can increase your and reduce their morale.

Kharkiv is a priority. It is a huge population centre and a massive logistic hub. Getting it out of being shelled is …huge.

I think continued progress in the north east will be dictated by terrain. The woods are good for Ukraine. Also, when Ukraine takes them, I’d back them to keep that territory. At the very least Russia would pay a massive price to take it again. Especially once Ukraine is dug in.

So it looks like woods all the way to Izyum. My thinking would be move east to cut their supply routes, then south to take Izyum. Probably will take 2-4 weeks. That would be a reasonable priority because taking Izyum seriously changes the shape of the lines in the east.

After that I don’t know. It would depend on how badly Russia’s eastern forces are drained.

I think diving for Mariupol is a trap. It’s flat and you have enemy forces on both sides. Sadly for the forces in the Avozstel, I can’t see them being liberated anytime soon.

Kherson seems to be another priority. It would end any Russian dreams in the south. I could see Ukraine giving that a serious nudge in a month or so. Possibly advancing from three sides at once. East, north and a push south from zapoporesia. If Ukraine are trying that then you know Russia is a spent force. I can’t see that happening for at least a month.

So yeah, I think your order of proceedings seems reasonable my armchair friend!",1652311459.0,1652311240.0,t3_un0zl4,t1_i88vtrr,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

>Originally, the word ""artillery"" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor. Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, ""artillery"" has largely meant cannons, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, and mortars (collectively called cannon artillery, gun artillery or tube artillery), and rocket artillery. In common speech, the word ""artillery"" is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called ""equipment"". However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses ""artillery piece"", but most English-speaking armies use ""gun"" and ""mortar"". The projectiles fired are typically either ""shot"" (if solid) or ""shell"" (if not solid). Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used. ""Shell"" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions.   
   
Are you maybe getting stuck on the fact that they called it ""artillery"" and not ""artillery pieces"", and assuming the user meant a full artillery battery? I took it as them asking what weapon caused this, not really implying anything about the size of the organization attached to it

Kangaroos were created as an expedient measure ""in the field"" by the Canadian Army, and were so successful that they were used by other Commonwealth forces, including the British Army. Their ability to manoeuvre in the field with tanks was a major advantage over earlier designs, and led to the dedicated APC designs that were introduced by almost all armies immediately after the war.

Few hours later we see US, UK and Turkey divert surveillance drones largely off their path to the area for whole day.

Followed by US president taking a more careful line about intelligence sharing.

An A10 Warthog has a gun that precisely fires 100+ rounds into a target, in contrast. When an A10 Warthog blows something up, its not a shot worth recording, its just **assumed** that it worked out. Same with AC-130. The ""meta"" strategy here is to have big-guns on airplanes, and those airplanes shoot those guns precisely onto enemy targets.

Drones are still trying to find their best strategies right now. Dropping 1 or 2 bombs after flying overtop enemies is interesting, but reminds me very much of early WW1-era tactics, rather than even WW2 style combat or modern-combat. When pilots would drop grenades out of airplanes and pull out pistols to shoot each other.

I've seen the evolution of air-combat through history. WW1-era biplanes dropping grenades and other munitions from overhead is certainly effective and kills things, but this isn't where progress ends.

You only have to miss twice before your drone was completely fucking useless. That was a lot of WW1 and WW2 era combat, you flew out for 2 hours to find the enemy, you dropped your bomb. You missed, you return home.

If you're spending the time flying out to try to hit the enemy (and if there's a chance the enemy will shoot you down, so its not like the sortie itself is risk-free), you want to have a very high probability of actually hitting the target.

--------

A few bombs delivered to a position can be done much quicker through the use of Mortar and/or Artillery. Drones are ""competing delivery mechanisms"" so to speak, especially since we have laser-guided mortar rounds today.

https://youtu.be/evqkZAqvOzI?t=41

Mortar is indirect fire, so they can be hiding in a forest (or even their own trench) somewhere 5km or 10km away, and accurately place shots like this 5 or 6 times a minute. Certainly faster than a drone flying back-and-forth.

I think a drone can serve as the laser-pointer in this scenario? (laser-guided mortar still needs someone over there to hold a laser on the target).

GPS-guidance (ie: Excalibur) is right out. These tanks were, as you said, on a bridge, and clearly moving. Look at the ""turret-pops"", these were **direct hits**.

Again, and again, and again, and again.

Something **incredibly** accurate fought here. Mortar is more accurate / precise than artillery, so I'm guessing that, but its still a guess.

My #2 guess is yes, vehicle-vs-vehicle combat. Maybe a few Ukrainian tanks were in the forest sniping these guys from 3km away, inside the forest. Instead of 20-seconds hang-time per shot (like Mortar), a Ukrainian tank team could fire anti-tank rounds with only ~2 seconds of hang-time. Tanks can fire these kinds of shots every 8 seconds or so. A coordinated team of 4 Ukrainian Tanks could kill 16 enemy vehicles in 30 seconds.

The bridge has holes in it. Something top-down was also hitting: maybe artillery, maybe mortar. Hard to say. But there's only 3 or 4 holes in the bridge. There wasn't ""much"" artillery, so its not like this was a crazy GRADs / MLRS barrage.

If those Ukrainian tanks cleared the right trees from the forest and setup the right positions, they could be well hidden by the terrain, and effectively shooting fish in a barrel.

---------

I don't know what happened here. Its a mystery. But I'm really thinking that somebody was there in a close-combat. At a minimum, somebody was shining a laser for highly-accurate laser-guided rounds. The precision and shear mass of attacks however... I'm really leaning more and more towards a Ukrainian Tank squadron mopped up / ambushed this group.

The premise behind the Hunger Plan was that Germany was not self-sufficient in food supplies; to sustain the war and keep up domestic morale, it needed food from conquered lands at any cost. The plan created a famine as an act of policy, killing millions of people.

Again, they're workable to get around (redesigning the electronics, salvaging the ICs, doubtfully designing/fabbing themselves but possible) but it takes time and money. I doubt they're prepared for those disruptions, at least immediately. But without the schematics in front of me, I couldn't tell ya.

I don't doubt you on the KH-101 modules, but the big question is are they still being produced today? Or are they using a stockpile from eons ago? They most likely did a run of thousands (tens) of missiles, then stopped production. If they wanted to make new ones they would have to resource all the chips on those electronics. Finding a fab that makes those chips is difficult. Not technologically, but financially they're most likely still not produced. ICs have a relatively short life cycle. And it's likely they weren't produced in Russia but China or Taiwan, which may or may not be able to resupply them.

Either way it won't be immediate. A big example of this on the western side is again the Javelins and Stingers. We designed and manufactured them over a decade ago. Creating more is difficult because all of the guidance electronics used ICs no longer produced by fabs. Once again, not technologically difficult to make, but the defense industry doesn't buy ICs at the scale to keep fabs open. And the DoD doesn't want to splurge the cash for fabs. Chips have short life cycles (just a couple years for modern chips). Along with the fact commercial products that get refreshed every year, so it's not an issue in that space.

My only source for using FPGAs in final products is myself. I designed guidance computers for a decade. It's no secret we use them along with SoCs. Only readily available proof would be to pull job postings from the defense contractors, they'll list what skills they want (which will include CDL and FPGA circuit board design).  Creating custom chips is too expensive for defense products (there's exceptions, but it's really only 1-2 components in the guidance section). They don't operate at the scale to make it financially feasible. Remember, missiles are at the best being produced in the 10s of thousands (usually just thousands), versus commercial electronics who are in the 100 of thousands to millions.",1652255529.0,1652255335.0,t3_un0zl4,t1_i85nrcq,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

Along with their lack of technical knowledge (in electronics) and money. A lot more discrete based, using legacy items like vacuum tubes. While the west throws SoCs and FPGAs at their problems.

They for sure have to run at least a couple processors (not necessarily state of the art) in there (for most missiles), though. Those have memory (RAM, solid state, etc.). If they're not, I'd love to see those designs, lol. And the combination of all of that can go obsolete.

Outbreak of World War II (1939)  
In late August 1939, Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris. Hitler had long planned an invasion of Poland, a nation to which Great Britain and France had guaranteed military support if it were attacked by Germany. The pact with Stalin meant that Hitler would not face a war on two fronts once he invaded Poland, and would have Soviet assistance in conquering and dividing the nation itself. On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland from the west; two days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany, beginning World War II.

When I was talking with some Russian colleagues, older IC runs were pretty long as their yield was pretty low, to the point they sometimes were running it an order of magnitude longer to guarantee the required number of final chips. And as you probably know if you set the manufacturing process up there is not much difference for the fab if they'll make 100 or 500 wafers. So sometimes they were ending with much more chips than they originally needed. And not only chips - I was reading the same story was for vacuum tubes. My FiL has still some Russian NOS tubes from '60s. 

As to ingenuity - I have to admit - I was impressed with some solutions. Like I saw a MiG 29's radar up close.

You trolls always resort to insulting intelligence, as if that means shit coming from low life ruzzian trolls.

Lol. Yeah, I think you're overcompensating. You're hell bent on sounding smart you sound pathetically dumb.

Aha, you are definitely a troll of ruzzian origin.

""Such this"" and ""such that"" is a dead giveaway, specifically when native English speakers have far easier means of expressing themselves.

You also have no daughter. micro-penis, remember? You're too insecure to approach women.
