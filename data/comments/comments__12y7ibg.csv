In previous waves the authorities mostly kept to the more remote regions. Saturday morning there was apparently a sweep of student housing in Moscow, with students rounded up and driven to military recruitment offices at 9 am. 

Traditionally University students in Russia are exempt from the military draft. Those who have been whisked away and forcibly drafted were confident they were exempt. 

Sources show screenshots of a group chat where one of these students was trying to contact a lawyer about his exempt status, then posted ""that's it, I'm going to the army"" and has not posted anything since. 

Other Moscow students also report receiving mass conscription notices delivered personally to their door. In some cases the notices are accompanied by burly cops who handcuff the draftees and take them away. 

Note that this is conscription, not mobilization. Conscription is for the younger men who had never had basic training. A mobilization is for those who had already been conscripted previously, considered ""ready for combat"". Of course with Putin's freshly signed legislation the lines between the two are blurred. 

> According to the coordinator of the ""Movement of Conscious Objectors"", human rights activists did not expect raids at the beginning of the draft.

> “Traditionally, such raids take place somewhere after the May holidays,” the human rights activist says. ""I have a suspicion that now they are trying to fulfill the conscription plan faster, so they can fully focus on the [second wave] of mobilization. Because it is too much for them [to deal with] both the flow of mobilized and the flow of conscripts at the same time.”

There are multiple sources, including posts, videos etc. I'm planning to make a full article about BTG and why we don't see them recently. During gathering the information process I found some interesting reports (OSINT, so nothing classified), used some math and I think that data itself is interesting enough to post.

Those numbers represent not a point in time, but maybe summary taken across about 2 weeks, so they can be off by a few percent, but not more.

Russia in Ukraine has total of:

- 1750 tanks

- 4300 armored vehicles (anything that is not a tank, but still has armor - so from BMP to MT-LB)

- less than 2900 barrel artillery


- less than 850 rocket artillery


Those numbers include every single vehicles in any state that is not crossed out from the unit (so anything from fully combat ready T-90M to T-62 without the tower that someone was able to drive home) and vehicles in process of being repaired. As of two weeks ago 38% of tanks from this number had status ""under repair"". 

What is even more important - no reserves. Checking around other military units around Russia - there is nothing. No more tanks in active service nor artillery. A few units are defending Moscow and surroundings , few AA setups are defending air bases, but there are no tanks, no armored vehicles, no artillery in active service that can otherwise be sent to Ukraine. This number doesn't include manufactured tanks or tanks being restored from long term cold storage.

So yes, Russia is fully committed in Ukraine. I have similar numbers about manpower, but I'm still in the process of verification of that data. Hope someone will find it useful.


Edit: I'm just reading interesting report. The pearl in RUAF tank force - T-90M - was found to be hardly serviceable in field conditions. Any repairs need to be done in properly equipped repair shop. Looks like even T-80 with it's turbine engine is easier to maintain and repair. I find it dubious, but that's what it says.",1682429393.0,1682403071.0,t3_12y7ibg,t3_12y7ibg,,0,172,0,172,0,0,

Ukraine's military has claimed it is achieving “impressive results” against Russian forces on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson.

“Over the past three days, we have quite impressive results of our combat work,” the spokeswoman for Ukraine’s Southern Command said in a national broadcast Tuesday.

“We have managed to hit and destroy artillery pieces, tanks, vehicles, armored vehicles, and enemy air defense systems,” Natalia Humeniuk said. “In other words, our work on clearing the front line of the east bank is quite powerful, but we are still working in a counter-battery mode.”
Humeniuk hinted that further developments would be expected in the near future. She went on to say Russian evacuations from the banks of the Dnipro were also facilitating Ukrainian operations.

“They [the Russians] are also clearing the territory of the local population, which makes our work much easier, because they are trying to evacuate the locals there where they are moving their units and moving to new locations,” she said.
“Therefore, it is safer for us to carry out our work at combat positions where they are no longer hiding behind the locals.”

Some background: Speaking to CNN earlier this week, Yurii Sobolevskyi, first deputy head of Ukraine’s Kherson regional council, said about 30% of the pre-war population remains in the temporarily occupied territories of the Kherson region.

“It is very difficult to calculate because we have no access to data on the number of active subscribers from mobile operators and other means,” he said.

In the interview, Sobolevskyi claimed that for the past two weeks the Russians had been trying to coerce civilians in towns on the river to leave their homes.",False,1682432695.0,t3_12y7ibg,t3_12y7ibg,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

Ukraine is likely to launch a counteroffensive soon, with one of its main goals to break through a southern land corridor between Russia and the Russia-annexed Crimea region, military analysts have said.

An important step in achieving this would be retaking all the Kherson region. 

It currently only holds the south.

To help achieve this, Ukrainian forces based on the western side of the Dnipro River said they were frequently carrying out raids on the eastern bank near the city in an effort to dislodge Russian troops.

Russian forces have held all territory east of the Dnipro since November, but Yuriy Sobolevskyy, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration, said today that the Ukrainian armed forces were working ""very effectively"" together.

""Our military visit the left (eastern) bank very often, conducting raids. The Ukrainian armed forces are working, and working very effectively,"" Mr Sobolevskyy told Ukrainian television.

""The results will come as they did on the right bank of the Kherson region when, thanks to a complex and long operation, they were able to liberate our territories with minimal losses for our military. 

""The same thing happens now on the left bank.""

- Germany is ace. It has made the EU energy independent of Russia in less then 12 months. …amazing.

- oil is 60% of Russias exports. From the time of the imposition of the price cap, Russia is LOSING $12 million a day on its oil sales.

- the sale of cheap oil to India and Russia has reduced oil prices around the world, which is considerably blunted OPEC’s ability to increase oil prices.

Most of those that have opposed Putin in the past are now either dead, in jail, exiled or scared into obedience.

Even before this war, if you spoke out against Putin you were either murdered or arrested by the brutal police and then the ""justice"" system would destroy your life and cripple you financially.  

There are quite a few Russian who were already living in exile as they feared being murdered for speaking out against Putin. One such exile you've likely heard of is Garry Kasparov who is still speaking out against Putin and who supports Ukraine.  

It's like a Russian once said, if someone knocks on your door and asks if you support Putin you say yes.  

Don't forget that hundreds of minors are being investigated by the authorities for anti-war sentiments. They will happily take your children away from their parents and then imprison the parents. The response to the girl who drew that picture wasn't a one off. That's normal now in Russia.  

Don't forget the power of propaganda. Even many of the elites privately believe the Kremlin propaganda. Those elites are also under no illusions as to who is in charge.  

If the Russians rose up against Putin they'd be crushed by the brutal police or run over by tanks. It wouldn't be the first time.  

Lastly, don't forget that the Russians have no hope in their futures getting better. They fear Russia collapsing as it did at the fall of the Soviet Union. They believe that will happen should Putin be toppled. The fall of the Soviet Union was a time when money was worthless and people starved.  

Revolutions and toppling dictators doesn't guarantee a happy ending. Things can, and often do, get significantly worse for the average person. So many people may die in an uprising, either from injury, starvation or lack of medicine. Countries like America who gained their independence from Britain are so lucky that they survived the ordeal. A good outcome is *never* guaranteed.  

At the beginning of a BBC documentary called Russia 1985–1999: TraumaZone What It Felt Like to Live Through The Collapse of Communism and Democracy, it showed archival footage of a Russian woman before the collapse of the Soviet Union being asked what her hopes and dreams were. She said she doesn't have any. She used to, but not any more.  

You can find that [documentary here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGDByvdY5CHX_BTvG2X4vPrQfgqlSwSy5) should you wish to watch it. It is made exclusively of archival video footage. Just bear in mind that you will see plenty of dead and mangled bodies from wars, uprisings being crushed, gang warfare, car bombs, etc.  

To identify their sons during the first Chechen war, the mothers had to watch hours of video tapes showing all the dead bodies or what was left of them. One mother said she had to keep taking tablets just to get through that living nightmare.  

It's a very good documentary, but I found it incredibly harsh what with my depression.  

You may also wish to seek out the 6 part documentary The Dictators Playbook (2019) by PBS. After watching that you may get a sense of why people don't, or cannot, rise up against dictators.  

Of particular interest is the aftermath of Saddam using chemical warfare on civilians. I know someone who was in the armed forces at the time who saw so many of those dead civilians. Mothers were still clutching their children, cradling them in their arms as they tried to comfort and protect them from the attack. All of them were dead.

At Kharkiv Ukraine was advancing, it was visible for the Ukrainian soldiers that they were clearly winning that battle.   
Bakhmut is not so visible, it is difficult for the soldiers in Bakhmut to see that clear victory, they are literally fighting for their lives, and are still being pushed back from their positions, and this has been happening for over what 9 months now? It's impossible for those soldiers to maintain such a high view of their leadership in the middle of that type of hell. Also they have been  told that the leadership is holding back significant reserves that could help them in order to prepare those reserves for a counter offensive, and while that counter offensive is being prepared they just need to hold on. Many of those soldiers rightfully believe that they have done enough, that they should have been withdrawn weeks ago, yet they are being told by their leadership to hold on, to keep defending that wreck of a city, i do not at all blame those soldiers for having negative view of their leadership.   


But that doesn't mean that their generals are wrong, there is a lot about the battle of Bakhmut that we simply don't know.

You included all armored vehicles in your original comment...

So sorry but there is just no way that Russia has completely stripped every IFV, artillery piece and tank from the East. They would still want some forces in the area for the Kuril island dispute with Japan where they were still doing shows of force last year *after* the war started. They would also want some armor available to defend Vladivostok which is their major Pacific report. And of course just on the very off chance China gets any silly ideas if the internal security situation degrades within Russia, and the internal security situation is another reason that they would not strip everything from the east, if civilian unrest breaks out some IFV's are great to intimidate the populace with.

Some publically accessible list of units they've moved to Ukriane doesn't mean much as it doesn't mean they've moved the whole unit. In fact that was one issue listed as to why Russia's initial invasion was not successful, some units had just had elements taken from them and not the entire thing.

Russia might be corrupt and incompetent in many ways but they have not left the entire east of the country entirely stripped of every last BMP or 152 mm artillery piece when it would take *days* to get anything there if needed. Stripping everything from the Finnish border is a little different as you could get units there fairly quickly if need be. Just like still having some units to guard Moscow is viewed as necessary so would having some armored forces left in the east.

Even in world war 2 there were still some armored Soviet forces in the east while Russia was fighting for its existence in the west against the Germans. Remember the Soviets built the entire BAM railway in the 70's and 80's north of lake Baikal just to have another transit route to the east farther north from China's borders. That's how great their strategic concerns are in the east,  they committed billions to a mega project to secure it.

So I just don't buy that they drained all there armor to Ukraine from the region, no doubt they have taken a lot of it, maybe even most of it, but not all of it. It would simply leave them far to vulnerable in a way even Russia isn't stupid enough to do.",False,1682446782.0,t3_12y7ibg,t1_jhn3gjv,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

My answer to most countries is basically “thanks for what you’ve done but you could send even more weapons and impose even higher sanctions.” I also am critical of world leaders that have used soft rhetoric when it comes to Russia (I would sometimes put Scholtz in this category).

When I say this I’m not really signaling Germany out. I have criticisms in spades for the US, UK, Canada, France, Poland, Turkey, Italy and I think you get the picture.

When you ignore cogent counter points to what you're saying prepare for someone to say them in a less, shall we say, ambiguous way. Also that report simply states that those units from the Eastern/Pacific region are involved in the fighting in Ukraine, it does not state that they have been sent in their entirety nor does satellite imagery see every vehicle parked in every garage or where they might be deployed to in the region.

As I said no doubt many units have been stripped of much of armored vehicles, probably even the majority of them, but it has been shown many times that Russia has often not sent entire units together to Ukraine instead opting for piecemeal deployments that further degrade combat effectiveness.

Why have they done this for some units? To continue to leave some combat power in strategically important places, places like the Eastern/Pacific area. You are placing more faith in a list that says the whole unit went than common sense, and in this it's case common sense even the Russians wouldn't ignore.",False,1682462472.0,t3_12y7ibg,t1_jhp50ut,,9,-1,0,-1,0,0,

If there is no activity in the homebase how should it be interpreted? That administration that is left is trained combat unit with their vehicles in warehouses? Ok in EMD case - a lot of those people went to training units, helping to train mobilized men, but I don't see any confirmation that i.e. a full combat ready battalion is left of such and such brigade in such and such base. 

Also according to ""Combined Forces Group of the Russian Federation in the Southwestern Theater of Military Operations"" from March 2023, article, there are 396k Russian soldiers in Ukraine, less than 3k in Belarus. In February 2022 total RU ground forces were estimated at 300k, later on increased to 360k (no, we are not talking about administration, just soldiers here).

So if there are full units in the Eastern Military District, there are not many of them. Not counting training units I have discrepancy of about 10k people. Even on err on the high side it means there are less than 6% of total ground forces NOT involved in Ukraine. 

Yes, I know - saying that such and such battalion went to Ukraine doesn't necessary mean the whole battalion went there. But if not, then... where? Were they leaving a tank company or something?

I'll check again in a few weeks when I'll have access to updated sat images to see what changed. Also I will not publish my article yet, because I see I need to properly support my hypothesis and data with sources.

Quite the opposite when I have repeatedly said Russia has often *not been moving entire units.* What was left has most likely been condensed somewhere which would explain a lack of activity on many bases but they would not leave 0 tanks, 0 IFV's and 0 artillery in the entire eastern/Pacific theatre. Even the Russians aren't that dumb. How small are the numbers that are left? Probably pretty small I would guess maybe as low as a dozen tanks and a few dozen each of IFV's and artillery pieces just in case. Basically just enough to throw something together that would have at least some punch if they needed it.

But yes as I agreed most of Russia's ground forces have been shifted to Ukraine but they would not totally leave the east completely bare. They probably did leave some of their least trained troops and poorest and oldest vehicles but something is still there, no doubt.

As an aside I think that many on this thread, and the west in general, are too eager to believe things that make Russia look as weak as incompetent as possible because that means more of a chance that Ukraine can win and win quickly. And I get that, I wish Russia was weaker than it probably is because I want Ukraine to win too. And they're not strong, but they're not as weak as some assume. You always have to be weary when something tells you exactly what you would most like to hear, and Russia being so desperate there isn't a single armored vehicle or piece of artillery left in the east would be what I would love to hear. However taking into account the historical importance of the area to Russia that is just so unlikely that I would not believe it. Russia is corrupt and incompetent in many ways but even they would not leave nothing there.

In your article I would avoid making absolutist statements, I think based on the evidence it's fair to say that the vast majority of armor and infantry in the East has been drawn off for Ukraine but given the distance, ongoing border issues with Japan, and yes still China despite them making nice in public, it's hard to imagine every last bit of it has been moved to Ukraine. That is a statement backed up be the satellite photos, units from the East we find fighting in Ukraine and the fact that Russia is not going to leave an entire flank of its country totally unable to defend itself on the ground. One statement, it's all been moved to the west, is not provable, but saying the vast majority of it has been is provable and would still allow for common sense to prevail.
