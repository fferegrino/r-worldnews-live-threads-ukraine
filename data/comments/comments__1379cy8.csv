Day 434-435 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were, thankfully, pretty uneventful here in Kharkiv even though Kremlin was hit, but Russians did still target other cities in ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù. As usual they sent a bunch of drones at Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. There were some reports of missiles being used yesterday, but it doesn‚Äôt look like it actually happened, most likely they only used Shaheds.

They also continued their drone attacks today, a couple of Shaheds were shot down in both Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia an hour ago, but it seems like this drone attack is already over because all the air raid alerts have ended. The amount of drone attacks from both sides is definitely ramping up right now, seeing Kremlin burn is great, but seeing their oil depots burn is even better as it directly impacts their logistics.

After the yesterday‚Äôs drone attack on Odesa our forces posted pictures of the intercepted Shaheds that they found and the wrecks had ‚Äúfor Kremlin‚Äù and ‚Äúfor Moscow‚Äù written on them, so they are definitely mad that Kremlin was attacked. It‚Äôs funny that they don‚Äôt care about their soldiers nearly as much as they care about some stupid building. There was barely any retaliation after we killed hundreds of their soldiers in a HIMARS strike on the New Year‚Äôs Eve, but after their precious Kremlin was damaged, they immediately sent multiple waves of drones at our cities.

And when the retaliation happens in the form of 2 drones, they're having a meltdown how Ukraine is escalating things...

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 04 May 2023.  


* On 3 May 2023 a fire broke out at a Russian fuel depot in Volna on the Russian mainland side of the Kerch Strait, close to the Crimean bridge. It was initiated by a suspected drone strike.  

* This follows a pattern of Russian fuel storage sites being damaged since the start of the year, with fuel depots in occupied Ukraine and the Russia-Ukraine border regions remaining particularly vulnerable to attack.  

* The disruption to the fuel storage and distribution network will likely force adjustments to Russia‚Äôs military refuelling operations to mitigate targeting.  

* Russian adjustments could include deploying additional protection measures at fuel storage sites, as seen in Tuaspe in Russia, or relying on infrastructure in less threatened regions.

There are two different things going on here. The first one is big Indian companies like Reliance and Tata buying Russian oil at a significant discount, processing it and then selling the processed petroproducts on the open market where it is bought by Western companies. This is a significant profit loss for Russia and this is probably being done by the implicit approval of Western governments.

However there is another category of Indian companies that were tiny and irrelevant two years but are now shipping millions of barrels of Russian oil. This one Indian company only had two ships and less than $100,000 in cash two years ago but now it's among the biggest suppliers of oil to Europe. This and similar companies have most likely been taken over by Russian intelligence who are now using them to just relabel Russian oil as ""Indian"" oil and selling it to Europe with almost all the profit going to Russia.

The explosion is too red. It also leaves some traces burning. High explosives don't work like that. They have time to fully explode before they are pushed away by the blast. High explosives detonates at several kilometers per second, but fireworks detonate at 100m/s. The explosion created a lot of white smoke, like black powder.

That would be a good choice if you're actually trying everything you can to not destroy whatever you're aiming at. Or if you are a partisan with no access to actual explosives (although you can make some yourself in your kitchen that are better than that, it's really not that hard).

False flag attack. Anyone who thinks Putin and the Kremlin are above attacking their own government buildings as an excuse for ramping up attacks on Kyiv might be suffering from naivete. The 1999 apartment bombings in Buynaksk, Moscow, Volgodonsk should serve as testament this scenario is entirely possible. Besides, the Putin Era of Fascist Dictatorship has little need of a Senate building.

  
As the Kremlin claims, a covert Ukrainian team carried out the attack. But this doesn't make sense for a couple of reasons. 1) Ukrainian intelligence is very, very good at keeping track of Putin. If they were truly out to kill him they would have attacked his compound in Novo-Ogarevo. 2) It would royally piss off NATO who have repeatedly requested of Ukraine not to execute attacks on Russian soil. You don't alienate your single largest ally in extremely difficult times.

  
Russian intelligence knew of a plan by partisan extremists to attack the Kremlin and allowed it to happen anyway as an excuse for increasing attacks on Kyiv. Maybe. Hearken back to 2002 when forty Chechen rebels took hostages at the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow. Western analysts have long believed Russian intelligence knew of the attack well in advance but let it happen anyway in order to generate public support for rolling tanks into Chechnya.

  
Russian dissidents did it. Meh. Yes, there's a lot of anger directed at the Kremlin these days by Russian citizens over new conscription laws and too many sons coming home in boxes.

1. False Flag: Highly unlikely. Russia didn't even mention the attack in the morning press briefing and didn't discuss it until the footage was circulating on social media and they were forced to respond. The attack makes them look weak and vulnerable, and they have no real method of response, given the problems those might bring (full mobilisation, tactical nukes etc).
2. Ukraine: Unlikely. Official denial, plus the fact that it serves no purpose for Ukraine beyond the dubious advantage of making Russia look weak, no real military advantage. Also very long drone flight for such little payoff. Conversely it gives Russia something to 'justify' brutal attacks, and may overshadow Zelensky's visit to The Hague, so overall it's a net negative for Ukraine. Not them.
3. Russian Partisans (pro-Ukr): Also unlikely. Huge risk of reprisal, and they would have known well that Russia would use this as a pretext for further violence against Ukraine. Serves no real purpose.
4. Russian ultra-patriots: Plenty to gain. The attack makes it really hard for Putin not to escalate. Raises the pitch and stakes for the war. Also makes the Russian leadership feel less safe and more threatened, especially given they almost certainly know this is the source. The 'Angry Patriots Club' or similar would have the resources to pull this off and the motive, with literally zero downside.

It's crazy to watch a historically heroic stand occur in real time. Every time Ukraine pushes back and reestablishes their foothold, it becomes increasingly obvious that this is chokehold by which the AFU have chosen to tear the Russian forces asunder. 

At this point it doesn't matter where Ukraine strikes first. They have Russia so focused on Bahkmut that they will be powerless to resist wherever the blow or blows land.

If we exclude social media and propaganda and just concentrate on the big news media, it's in their best interests (viewer retention, ratings and money) to keep bombarding their viewers/readers/listeners with the Next Big Thing. They have to continually push whatever will grab the viewers attention and stop them from changing the channel.  

You may find this 15min interview with Jon Stewart and Bob Iger interesting. It's titled [Can The News Be Fixed? An Interview With Disney's Bob Iger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C79xxjdXsE).  

Here's the Youtube blurb:  
>Jon sits down with former Disney CEO and Chairman Bob Iger, who oversaw ABC news, to see if there‚Äôs a better way to do TV reporting. Does news have to be so hyped up? Is there a version that can cut through the noise and still be profitable? Do all these questions make this read like a teaser for nightly news? More at 11.  

Edit:  

Yes, I know about the story. I read it elsewhere before I saw it on reddit.  

To answer the question I was pointing out *why* the news media will use it and *how* they will use it.  

Take for example two headlines, one from the Guardian ""False flag or genuine attack? What we know about the Kremlin drone incident"" and one from the BBC news live feed ""US denies any involvement in Kremlin drone attack"".  

They're going to report both (or more) sides of this story whether people like it or not. It's what they do. Some will even do it with climate change where they will air the views for and against climate change, or for and against vaccines.

 And over the last few months drones have been punching deeper and deeper into Russia, with several already coming down in the Moscow suburbs. 

The leaked US intel documents had SIGINT of Ukraine planning attacks on Moscow.

Ukraine attacking the symbolic heart of their enemies makes a lot more sense than any argument I've seen for this being a Russian false flag.

Rather, it would be in order to have a ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù excuse to cancel or scale back public participation in May Day parades, due to the alleged risk. 

Several regions in Russia have already cancelled them, due to the alleged risk of ‚ÄúUkrainian strikes‚Äù even before this drone attack. Such cancellations lack an air of reality, when the regions are hundreds of miles from the border. However, if drones can strike at the Kremlin, then it makes sense.

Proof? Well, not proof positive, but the actual Russian statement in response to the strike specifically mentions the risk to the May Day parade. 

Why do the Russians care? Because the parades are likely to attract public displays of unhappiness over the rising casualties and lack of actual victories. 

In other words, Russia needs no excuse to indulge in more terrorism against Ukraine. But they may want a plausible reason to curtail public parades, which may create public displays they don‚Äôt want.

There is a lot of debate as to whether bombing of civilains, and now missile/drone attacks of course, only increases civilian commitment to a war rather than weakening it. The logic for that goes that if you're a civilian in an untouched area you might feel disconnected from the war but if you're being attacked too all the sudden fighting whoever you are seems to make a lot more sense, after all they're attacking me where I live now instead of some distant front line.

Plus it can also unite the social classes in unexpected ways. In London during the second world war the east end of the city was hit more than any other simply because it was near the docks. After Buckingham palace was hit the Queen mother remarked: ""I am glad we have been bombed. Now we can look the East End in the eye."" Class lines start to blur when everyone is just as vulnerable. Widespread bombing of German cities, that took even more lives than attacks in England, didn't seem to weaken German resolve either. You could argue that nuclear weapons changed that calculus but since no one has used them since the attacks on Japan they're not really an option unless you want a nuclear attack in return.

All in all aerial bombardment seems to make civilians more understanding of how grim fighting a war must be as they experience some of the same dangers and soldiers less likely to resent people on the homefront for the same reason. Basically the psychology seems to say that attacking civilians only makes both civilians and soldiers more committed to each other and winning the war.",False,1683236885.0,t3_1379cy8,t1_jivtxql,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

This is not about having an 'excuse', this is about **collective security.** Lose the straits and you're screwed. I support Ukraine and I would like to see Sweden in as a Turk and I consider this kind of statements as an audacity for various reasons.

Not everyone is having the same opinion here. We have many different parties and an upcoming election. And regardless of whatever issue, we still have a functioning democracy. We have elections and elected officials. The opposition rules all the major cities and major provinces.

We are not like Russia, or even Hungary which you believe will apparently magically fix itself while there is **literally no functioning opposition** in Hungary. In contrast, my city and my neighborhood are pro-opposition. Our municipality is pro-opposition. More than half the population is served by pro-opposition municipalities.

So, anyway, are you going to continue fantasizing about punishing us as well? When are you going to stop making these generalizations and considering us on the same league as Russia?

And oh, did I forget to mention that Hungary is basically pro-Russian and tries to block all military to Ukraine, while Turkey's Bayraktar TB2s were a key component in the defence of Kyiv? Or that Turkey is producing battleships for Ukraine right now, as well as opening up a grain corridor so that Ukraine can trade freely without Russian attacks over the Black Sea?

Yeah, there had been some controversies regarding us too, but a useful ally with a large opposition base is better than a seemingly like-minded or 'western' nation with no contribution to the alliance, I suppose.

The tactics used by Wagner have demonstrated this clearly, they don't care about the lives of their soldiers, they are literally cannon fodder. What Prigozhin is doing here is actually far more simpler than any of that, He's just blaming someone else for the failures of the war, and that someone else are his political rivals inside the Russian MoD. He's saying that they're responsible for Russia's failures in the war, and not him, because he's the ""good Russian fighting for Russia"" or some other nonsense.   
This type of blame game is only going to become more common once the reality that Russia can't win this war starts to settle in the minds of even the most ultra nationalists in Russia.   


Anyway, He won't pulled his men out of the war, because he doesn't have that kind of power, he doesn't have that kind of autonomy.

^1  IMO, after studying many, many photos over his last 30 years, I concluded that Putin has does the following to his face:

- rhinoplasty, as least twice.  (Over a decade). Likely 3 times.
- extensive lower lid blepharoplasty 
- cheek implants
- chin & jaw implant
- mid-face facelift (possibly a lower face facelift, see below)
- tear trough fillers (ongoing)
- cheek fillers (ongoing), and possibly nasolabial fold fillers

Unclear if has done anything to upper lids.  While they are different, it‚Äôs very common that in older years, upper eyelids rapidly change their shape in a noticeable way.  Like sinking.  Or sudden drooping hood. And weight change can also cause that.  His eyebrows remain on browbone, so there‚Äôs no lift. I don‚Äôt think he did anything there.

Despite what some say, he doesn‚Äôt appear to get Botox.

If the UK or the White House wanted to really bomb the Kremlin, they‚Äôd probably do it with some tech we don‚Äôt even know exists.

PAC-3 missiles, which is what Ukraine got (iirc) are designed with the intent to be able to intercept tactical ballistic missiles. The entire Patriot missile system was designed based off work that Raytheon did as part of a few different air defense programs including the Field Army Ballistic Missile Defense System (all quoted from that wikipedia article.)  


\*EDIT\*: Further reading looks like Ukraine got the PAC-2 variant from Germany, so it probably stands to reason that the US one will be PAC-2.  That said, according to that same wiki article, the PAC-2 was an upgrade designed to increase the capabilities of the existing PAC-1 missiles against ballistic missiles, and was intended to turn the Patriot missile system into one that would function as an Anti-Ballistic Missile system in addition to it's other roles.

(i.e., including the negation) the mind/subconscious first has to process and make sense of its individual parts. So it has to process and interpret (and briefly focus on) ""a pink elephant"" before it can know what someone is telling it ""not"" to do. And what a person focuses on (even briefly) is like an 'instruction' to the unconscious mind.

This is why goals (desired outcomes) should be stated and imagined ""in the positive"" instead of in the negative.

E.g., it's better for someone who is dieting to think something like, ""I now weigh <target weight>"" instead of ""I no longer eat cream cakes"". The latter would be a terrible goal, because it puts the image of cream cakes in the mind, which conflicts with the goal.

So the sub/unconscious mind can sort-of process negatives/negation, it's just that, in order to do so, it *also* has to process the positive being negated, which usually involves a stronger 'signal' (e.g., a visual imaginary experience) in the mind.",False,1683218767.0,t3_1379cy8,t1_jiu9wkl,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Also Russias response wasn't right away, it was sometime after the attack happened, and (I think) only after footage started to show up in socials. 

The OSINT community is fairly well split on this issue too, and I see decent arguments from both sides, but personally feel that this was a UA operation. UA has also denied instances that were clearly them as well, like the rocket attack on Belogorad oil storage facility early in the war.

I will admit it is unusual for UA to attack non military / energy targets, but this war was always destined to ""come home"".
