Day 449-451 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days weren’t exactly quiet, there were 2 missile strikes from Belgorod and we were able to hear the explosions from the city both times, but it doesn’t look like Kharkiv was targeted directly. The first strike happened around midnight on the 18th and the second one at around 3pm on the same day. Apparently, they targeted Tsyrkuny during both strikes and both times their missiles landed near residential buildings, damaging some cars and a gas pipeline.

A missile strike during the day was pretty unexpected, they very rarely do it now as they mostly do their missile strikes during the night instead. At first, we even thought that the explosions we heard were the work of our sappers disposing of UXO because that has been happening everyday recently. It was only after the second loud explosion in a row and reports of missile launches from Belgorod that we realized that it was actually a new attack from Russia and not the work of our sappers.

It's great that there are finally serious talks about sending F-16 to us, and it’s even better if the training can actually be completed in just 4 months instead of years like it was previously stated. It would be truly amazing if our pilots manage to start flying on western jets by the end of this year, though I still doubt we will see them before next year. I guess the talks about jets are getting serious now specifically because cruise missiles were approved and sent to us, which means sending F-16 isn’t much of an “escalation” anymore (even if Russia screams that it is), since we already have long range missiles that can be used by our old jets.",False,1684621320.0,t3_13mhca0,t3_13mhca0,,0,162,0,162,0,0,

_____________________________________________________


ECHO FROM STUDENT YEARS


The decisive and fatal change in our country happened during my student days. When my class entered the Polytechnic in 1947, we were inhabitants of a world. When we graduated in 1952, we were already inhabitants of another world. Symbolically or not, during this period we went from being ""gentlemen"" to ""comrades."" The university entrance examinations we went through still reflected to a large extent the ""bourgeois"" sense of objectivity and fairness, because it was really the best prepared who got into the universities. Just five years later, there was no longer any semblance of an objective competitive system. The reign of ""my man"", of the liaison, had set in, which to this day remains the main method of selecting people and the main quality for achieving any personal advancement. It was in these five years that the age-old wall of popular moral scruples was broken down and the concept of ""criteria"" was discarded forever.


But from the very beginning, among us, the new students, appeared the unremarkable faces of young people who not only had not held any competition, but some of them did not even have a high school diploma. They were brought into the university by virtue of some secret and incredible privileges. And although they were quite far removed from the science they were supposed to be studying, the faces of these strange fellows began to take on a special importance. Not infrequently the outline of a gun could be seen under their outer garments. The first feeling with which they treated us, the other students, was one of inexplicable loathing and constant suspicion. Particularly strong was their hatred of any more brilliant student or any more well-shaped individual. They were absent from lectures very often and gathered for long secret meetings that often lasted late into the night. We could see how they watched us, how they eavesdropped on our conversations, and how their faces became more and more menacing. They were the organizers of every social event and they bullied us, assigning us tasks that had nothing to do with the educational process. They dragged us to meetings, assemblies and labour brigades and demanded that we chant their slogans. They were the ones who organized student circles to study party propaganda materials. The academic training of most of them was zero, but they took their exams in a mysterious way. A few years later, when I taught a student course myself, the mechanics of this testing became clear to me. It was simply that one of the deputy ministers of light industry called me and ordered me to write a C on a hopeless student who was ""our child"".


""OURS"" and ""ENEMIES"" - these were the two most important concepts that took centre stage in our lives during those years. A ruthless division of people began that exceeded the cruelty of racist divisions because it condemned people to suffer not for the duration of one war, but for a lifetime. As has been explained to us, this followed from Stalin's formulation of the intensification of the class struggle in the transitional period. In a country like Bulgaria, where there were never any distinct classes, nor class struggles, nor blatant social inequality, Stalin's theory led to an artificial fanning of class conflict that will remain one of the absurdities of the time. ""Every Bulgarian will find his grandfather's Opanak in the attic"" is the popular phrase that most accurately reflected the classless nature of our country at the time. At first, this savage division of the people was carried out with that firmness with which cattle are marked for slaughter. But if a certain criterion was applied to cattle, the arbitrariness in marking people was incredible. Vast numbers of innocent people, marked as enemies, had to pay dearly and too dearly. But if I thought then that it was a question of individual mistakes, years later it became clear to me that in fact justice or injustice did not matter. What mattered was a process of division that would instill utter fear and confusion in every living being. So much so that the concept of ""OURS"" turned out to be highly relative. And in order to remain ""OURS"" one had to give evidence of it every day. ""OURS"" AND ""ENEMIES"" was the occasion for subjecting an entire people to cruel torture, for breaking and destroying natural human bonds, for pitting everyone against everyone. Years later I would see documented how Soviet state security and its Bulgarian agents had organized and staged on the Bulgarian stage this infernal play, written personally by Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, in which an entire nation was to play.",1684611520.0,1684609278.0,t3_13mhca0,t3_13mhca0,,0,53,0,53,1,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-20-23/index.html

""US President Joe Biden is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Hiroshima, Japan, Sunday, underscoring US support for Ukraine as top US officials herald a unified Group of Seven summit.

“We do expect that the president will have a bilateral meeting with President Zelensky,” a senior administration official told reporters, adding that the meeting will be “a little bit after 2 o’clock” p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET).

Biden, the official said, “will continue to reiterate the United States’ firm and resolute support for Ukraine going forward.”  

The official pointed to a “powerful statement of unity” from the G7 countries standing against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at this week’s summit, including sanctions and the announcement of a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 aircraft — efforts that were “spearheaded” by US national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

Asked about the possibility of China playing a role in ending Russia’s war, the official said the US hopes Chinese President Xi Jinping views this week’s summit as a signal of “resolve.”

“We would hope that President Xi and the (People's Republic of China) extract from what they’ve been seeing here … is that there’s an awful lot of resolve to continue to support Ukraine, as the G7 continues to say, for as long as it takes, and that China could have a meaningful role in helping end this war,” the official said.

Biden is also expected to have a trilateral meeting with South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida early Sunday afternoon local time. The official called the relationships a “priority” for Biden. The leaders will discuss security, economics and other topics.

Remember: The G7 comprises the world’s most advanced industrialized democracies: the US, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Italy.

When the west sends weapons to defend Ukraine many Russians legitimately believe it’s an attack on Russia with the intent to destroy Russia because they cannot internalize that the purpose of arming Ukraine is to get Russia to leave Ukraine. The other week when we saw the Z telegram freak out they legitimately thought they may be attacked in Moscow by NATO itself and they repeatedly build defenses in Russia because they think NATO will take Bolgorod. When Russia wants “peace talks” they always want them with the US and not with Ukraine.

At the end of the day this war is about Ukrainian freedom and honestly not much more. Ukrainians just want Russia out of their country and choose their own government with the full rights of any sovereign country. Russians can’t conceptualize this simple fact nor do they understand that the Ukrainian people have agency and do not want to be part of Russia. When Ukrainians toppled their increasingly autocratic government in 2014 Russia thought “western coup” and every time a Ukrainian fights back against invading forces the Russians see this as “unjust aggression” because they still can’t comprehend that Ukrainians have a right to choose their own future and are a legitimate country.",False,1684606064.0,t3_13mhca0,t3_13mhca0,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-20-23/index.html

""The chief of the Wagner private military group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, claimed Saturday that his forces have taken complete control of the long-contested city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. 

“The operation to capture Bakhmut lasted 224 days,” he said in a video posted to Telegram, seeking to claim a final victory for the city.

CNN could not independently verify Prigozhin’s claim, and a message from a Ukrainian defense official partially disputed it. 

Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, in a Telegram post less than an hour after the Russian mercenary’s claim was published, admitted the situation in Bakhmut was “critical” but said Ukrainian troops were still “holding the defense in the 'Airplane' district of the city,” which is on Bakhmut’s westernmost edge.

“As of now, our defenders control certain industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area and the private sector,” she said.

While Russian forces have continued their slow street-by-street advance in the city itself for many months, Ukrainian forces have recently managed to re-capture small pockets of outlying territory to the northwest and southwest of the city.

More about Bakhmut: The eastern city has been the focal point of a grinding battle between Ukrainian and Russia fighters.

Stark satellite photos show how much it has changed over the past year, with the city in ruins in many areas.

The city sits toward the northeast of the Donetsk region, about 13 miles from Luhansk region, and has been a target for Russian forces for months. Since last summer, the city has been a stone’s throw from the front lines, so its capture would represent a long sought-after success for Moscow’s forces – and bring some limited strategic value.

The city has important road connections to other parts of the Donetsk region; eastward to the border with Luhansk, northwest to Sloviansk and southwest to Kostiantynivka.""",False,1684595318.0,t3_13mhca0,t3_13mhca0,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-20-23/index.html

""Russia's deputy foreign minister has warned Western countries of “enormous risks for themselves"" if Ukraine is provided with F-16 fighter jets, Russian state media TASS reported Saturday.

""Movement is underway on the so-called escalation ladder,"" Alexander Grushko was quoted as saying on the sidelines of a meeting of the Russian Council on Foreign and Defense Policy. 

""We see that the Western countries are still adhering to the escalation scenario. It involves enormous risks for themselves. In any case, this will be taken into account in all our plans, and we have all the necessary means to achieve the set goals,"" Grushko added.

US President Joe Biden informed G7 leaders Friday that the US will support a joint effort with allies and partners to train Ukrainian pilots on advanced aircraft, including F-16s, a senior administration official told CNN.

Biden reversed his previous objections to providing the fighter jets because he believes in equipping the country for a long-term fight against Russia, his top national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters Saturday in Japan.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has framed his pitch for Western fighter jets as a matter of his country's survival, now more than one year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.""",False,1684592720.0,t3_13mhca0,t3_13mhca0,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

9b35345a4a8c8824c581be464731a7be,13mhca0,jkxrxsr,"And when in 1948-49 the indiscriminate wave of student purges broke out, when the trucks of state security were waiting at the doors of the universities to collect the students who had just been expelled, it became clear to all of us what science our gloomy colleagues had been studying all along. Suddenly and absurdly, it appeared that the most able, the most talented, the most outstanding students had to leave the sciences to which they had been called. I shall never forget the great assembly in the auditorium when the lists of those expelled from the student organizations were read, which meant automatic expulsion from the polytechnic as well. I shall never forget the barbaric silence in the midst of which victims and survivors voted with murderous unanimity in favour. I think now that we were all so frightened by the arrests, beatings and atrocities that were at the same time flooding the whole country that no one dared to call out. Yet then my colleague Paul, who was one of the brilliant mathematicians of the course, with a politically ""stable"" background, could not bear the picture of universal humiliation. He stood up and amid stony silence said firmly, ""What you are doing is disgraceful. You are excluding the best students. What is all this for. I must tell you that I am ashamed to be a student any more."" No sooner had he spoken the last words than someone suggested that he should be included in the list. Everyone silently voted. This indiscretion of Paul's cost him three years of black labor. I'm not sure if there had been more like him, things would have turned out differently. Paul's deed was chivalrous, beautiful, but one of the most characteristic features of Communists is their utter insensitivity to moral beauty, to any display of chivalry. The noble gesture, the beautiful deed of the adversary do not arouse in them any excitement. The gesture of the knight who throws down his gauntlet to his adversary is reciprocated with a scythe to the head or a stone to the nape of the neck.



During that winter, 1948-1949, we, the others in the redoubled courses, were already ""comrades"". Our comradeship was expressed in silent obedience, fear, servility, participation in all sorts of mass events such as: groups, work days and circles for studying the biography of comrade Stalin or that of Georgi Dimitrov. We had to utter phrases that nobody believed in, nonsense like ""the most genius leader, father and teacher of all progressive humanity"". Our intellectual individuality was degraded to that of trained bleating sheep, but we were left with the painful consciousness of the situation we were in. We could see that our professors, among them scholars of international renown, men of great authority, had also shrunk into their academic shells and seemed to suffer from even greater fear. Most of them pretended to be devoted only to their special sciences and were not interested in reality. Others sensibly and quickly accepted the new political religion, which stabilized their positions. The course and faculty leaders of the youth organization had more power than the administration. The lists these leaderships had drawn up to expel students were not their doing. They were brought to them by state security and party committees. It was a common thing to call individual students into the course management and interrogate them in order to squeeze information out of them about colleagues or professors. Somehow an atmosphere of constant surveillance was naturally created, where the slightest indiscretion could have decisive consequences. Gradually our sense of self-defence developed to such an extent that we all more or less acquired grim faces, and by the second half of our studies it was already difficult to distinguish us from our real ""comrades"". There was a kind of tragicomic race for everyone to show themselves more Catholic than the Pope, to erase any doubt about themselves and their family. It was a time when everybody was persistently searching his family tree for any facts of anti-bourgeois, antimonarchist, anti-fascist, etc. manifestation of some relative. It was the time when a huge number of people were simply inventing and fabricating ""progressive"" biographies. If you take the trouble to read the countless memoirs being published in this country today, you will be amazed at the millions of feats committed against the government during the Third Reich. The fabrication of a heroic Communist biography has become a universal phenomenon, so much so that members of the Politburo, generals, and prominent leaders themselves set the tone in inventing their own non-existent exploits.



 In this hunt for heroic moments everything was endlessly exaggerated, innocent arrests for drunkenness became political acts; the passing of a note from Peter to George became the dangerous activity of a party courier; a nickel scratched in the town cloze became equal to the salvo of the Aurora; technical mistakes of incompetence became sabotages, and acquaintance with this or that really active Communist became dearer than mother's milk. I know really funny stories about writing progressive autobiographies. But because the present was more important than the past, real theatrics were unleashed. Too often they jumped the measure and we found ourselves in the position of Schweik, following orders literally. When the portrait of Marusya Todorova appeared in the newspapers and she started weaving on twenty or fifty textile looms, some of my female colleagues immediately made their hair like hers. The soft hats disappeared, and instead almost everyone wore caps or ""stolinks"". A trend for rough, masculine manners that were supposed to be proletarian emerged. At the meetings, two-thirds of everyone's speeches contained expressions like ""as Comrade Stalin teaches us"" or ""as our beloved leader, Comrade Dimitrov, says."" Often the quotes were untrue, but who dared interrupt the performance... because it was a struggle for survival.",1684611545.0,1684609684.0,t3_13mhca0,t1_jkxr01u,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

I fled Kyiv in the very beginning and stayed at my parents’ for a while but returned shortly after the ~~retreat~~ gesture of goodwill from the North. It was hard during blackouts but luckily the winter was warm so it wasn’t too cold. Other than that, it may sometimes be hard to tell that there’s a war if you live in Kyiv. There’s curfew and checkpoints when you enter the city, as well as some fortifications here and there and armed people walking around, but most restaurants and other businesses including entertainments work, so it’s ever so slightly different from peace time. Rocket barrages are less frequent now (except the last few days) and anti air does their job well, so successful missile hits are rare, but those rascals launch them at night or early in the morning, so you may not always sleep well.

That being said, what I am describing only applies to Kyiv and me personally, if you live closer to the frontlines, it’s worse. They use short-mid range artillery there, so the shellings are way more frequent and the situation in general isn’t as peaceful. My relatives lived in Kherson from the beginning of full-scale invasion till shortly after it was liberated and when they left Russians were already shelling their apartment building. My mom has a friend from Mariupol and she (the friend) jokes that on Feb 23 she had a 3 bedroom apartment, then she had a 2 bedroom apartment, when she managed to evacuate, she was moving out of a 1 bedroom apartment.

The true answer of whether air superiority can be achieved by Ukraine depends on how Russia responds. See, Ukraine can destroy Russian AA with the F16 using the following method:

1. Fire a couple of decoy missiles, ADM-160B, at the frontline, as well as real long range missiles.
2. Russian AA fires up their radar to shoot down the decoys and real missiles.
3. F16 fires multiple HARM missiles, AGM88, to hom in on the radar to destroy it.
4. This should allow Ukraine to get local air superiority for a few hours until another radar gets into place, or the Russians decide to risk turning on nearby radar anyways, or the Russians vector in a few planes to intercept the F16.
4. Once local air superiority is lost, Ukraine jets make a getaway. If Russian jets are in the airspace then, they risk getting shot down instead.

So whether Ukraine can get air superiority partially depends on whether Russia decides to intercept those missiles or not. If they dont intercept, real targets get hit since real missiles are mixed in. If they turn on the radar, the radar gets hit. If they vector in Russian jets, then those risk getting shot down when Ukrainian jets run away. The idea is to present Russia with only bad options.

There is another variation for step 1, which US uses and that is to fly huge numbers of F16 into enemy airspace so that they are forced to turn on the radar. Ukraine is unlikely to be using this because too risky with limited airframes and a lot of skill required. 

So short answer, it depends on what the Russians do.

Edit : Another variation is to use the F16 itself, to bait Russian AA to turning on the radar, then fire mulitple HARM at it. We have seen Ukraine do this with MIGs they have. Again, risky but doable option. The option I highlighted is arguably lesser risk.",1684602598.0,1684599881.0,t3_13mhca0,t1_jkwx1tl,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

Malyar stated that these information operations allege that Russian strikes have recently killed Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces Commander General Ihor Tantsyura, Ukrainian Eastern Grouping of Forces Commander Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, and Ukrainian Commander in Chief General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi.[16] Prigozhin also amplified the information operation alleging that Zaluzhnyi might be dead on May 20.[17] These information operations are particularly absurd given that Zaluzhnyi spoke with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley on May 19 and that Syrskyi appeared on Ukrainian television on May 16.[18] Ukrainian officials have denied previous Russian claims that a May 10 strike on a Ukrainian command post in the Bakhmut area killed several high-ranking Ukrainian military officials and that Wagner forces killed Tantsyura while he was en route to Bakhmut on May 2.[19] ISW has previously assessed that Russian ultranationalists are increasingly seeking to frame any Russian operations as delaying potential Ukrainian counteroffensive actions.[20]

All our relationships were basically built on the suspicion that the one next to you meant you evil. The most vivid national paranoia that everyone was a possible agent of state security was born and blossomed. There is scarcely a police force in the world that has ever inspired greater terror and fear than our own homeland state security during those years. To this day, the phrase ""State Security's man"" evokes a strong reaction; one's face instantly changes color. Snitching also flourished. One of the most practiced methods by all sorts of authorities was to call out a citizen and spin until he said something against another citizen. Then the second citizen would be called in, and what the first citizen had said would be put to him, which, just because it was false, led to a strong reaction, and he would ""dip"" the deeply unhappy first citizen, who in turn, called in again, would give copious true and false material against the second. The aim of the new rulers was to stink up the people, to turn them against each other. For years afterwards I could observe the consistent and meticulous application of this theory of ""Divide and Rule"". This, in turn, naturally led to the desire for everyone to be someone's man, i.e. for everyone to take shelter under the wing of someone powerful by serving them. For the division was not only down below, in the lowlands, but also up above, on the peaks, where there was a life and death struggle between the various party groupings and mainly between the Soviet agents who had arrived from abroad, led by Georgi Dimitrov and Valko Chervenkov, and, on the other hand, the local party leaders. Later this struggle would take various other forms, but it would never cease, because the aim was that no one should be sure, that everyone should be afraid.





All too soon we went from being naïve and innocent young people, connected by natural bonds of humanity and friendship, by love and faith for people and the world, to ghosts of suspicion, fear and mutual hatred, a marked herd where each tried to push his neighbour away in order to gain a few more minutes himself.

A quick look at the situation in Bakhmut and the reasons it made a lot of sense to fight for it and hold it.

https://i.imgur.com/TQhH04O.jpeg

And yes we're using a map published by Wagner, as even they admit the Ukrainian advances (in blue) on the flanks of the city (red outlined area in the center)

Urban combat is brutal, bloody, hell.

https://i.imgur.com/mNzMcEr.jpeg

Ukraine forced the russians to fight house for house, street for street, cellar for cellar for almost 10 months.
The russians lost 50-70,000 troops (KAI, WIA, MIA) in Bakhmut... a strategically worthless town. Controlling Bakhmut isn't opening the road to anywhere, isn't blocking anything - holding Bakhmut just means holding a medium sized Ukrainian town. That's it.


But due to their own propaganda hype russians committed immense numbers of troops and sent more and more troops in to be killed. A stupid, vain move, but one the Ukrainians exploited. They bleed the russians out.

https://i.imgur.com/veAxmsH.jpeg


Now the russians control almost all of Bakhmut... and are bled dry. And now Ukraine has begun to attack the thinly manned russian flanks around Bakhmut. If Ukraine drives the russian off these flanks,
then the russians troops in Bakhmut can either retreat or they can stand, starve, die... like the Germans at Stalingrad.

Even war criminals like putin lackey Prigozhin understand this. 

https://i.imgur.com/pyvSTKh.jpeg


Now russia is sending reinforcements to the flanks... troops russia has to pull away from other sectors of the front, which reduces russia's ability to withstand the coming Ukrainian offensive.



Meanwhile Ukraine hasn't committed a single one of its new brigades to Bakhmut. Not one Western tank, not one Western infantry fighting vehicle - nothing that is being  readied for the coming offensive is even near Bakhmut.
Ukraine understood they had to weaken the russians & settled on letting the russian bleed out in Bakhmut. 

https://i.imgur.com/zE1PPNF.jpeg

Now that Bakhmut has served its purpose, the Ukrainians impose a dilemma on the the russians: reinforce Bakhmut's flanks & reduce the chances to withstand Ukraine's offensive, or let the flanks fall & lose Bakhmut. Dumb as the russian generals are they chose the latter & will lose much more soon.

Once again Ukrainians show us that they know what they do and are good at what they do.

Yes, Russia would advance. But at great cost, and at a mindnumbingly slow pace. It would likely end in a stalemate somewhere around the Dnieper with Russias offensive capabilities exhausted, yet Ukraine having enough defense and trenches to keep Russia from winning.

We literally had Russian TV with all their propaganda broadcast all over Ukraine until 2014 and after that its presence was greatly reduced and we banned the Russian social network VKontakte (InTouch - a Russian knock off of facebook), but you could still watch Russian TV or use banned Russian websites without too much hassle. After 2014 we had some shows on Ukrainian TV which were basically “look what those idiots are saying” cherrypicking the most outrageous claims from their TV and making fun of them or debunking some propaganda.

Since the full-scale invasion there isn’t much pro-Russian propaganda because you can get a life in prison for treason during war time unlike just 20 years during peace time. Kinda related to your question, my parents live in rural area in central Ukraine where everyone speaks Ukrainian, but their neighbour is an old lady from Belarus who continues to speak Russian to this day and evidently watched Russian TV because after full-scale invasion started she tried to calm people down by saying “don’t worry, Russians will do their job and everything will be fine soon”. For some reason people started ignoring her on the street and refusing her service and rumours are, she was paid a visit by SBU (Ukrainian FBI).

That being said, Russian propaganda is not just channels like RussiaToday and Russia 24. It’s also stuff like Fox and we have our own pro-Russia channels in Ukraine. I don’t watch TV but I know in the beginning, our government took full control of TV and there was a state-regulated 24/7 news broadcast on all channels, and I believe this is still the case. There’s still freedom of press on youtube, however, it’s impossible to sell the idea that Russians are good guys at this point so instead they push other topics like “are Ukrainians committing war crimes?”, “is it ok to prosecute the ~~FSB agents who disguise themselves as~~ priests of Russian church?”, “let’s start peace negotiations and end this war”. Nonetheless, Ukrainian populace became highly vigilant and nationalist (I don’t like the extent of nationalism but I guess it’s natural during war and people will calm down once it ends), so it’s very hard to find a person who doesn’t fully support our Armed Forces and everyone I know supports the idea of fighting till we liberate all our territories or till the last Ukrainian standing.

Finally, since propaganda was brought up, I will mention that I have relatives in Russia and sadly all of them either support this invasion or, best case scenario, are in the “it’s not so unambiguous” camp which means they know perfectly well that their TV lies all the time, but “they lie even more outside of Russia and daddy Putin knows the truth, so I will just trust him to make the right decision”.

other than the war itself being excessive and unnecessary, these words in your comment seem to contradict the rest of it.

Holding the line there effectively stopped the advance and it appears the invaders cannot effectively continue.

Of course there was cost to Ukraine, as there has been for the rest of the war. But comparatively speaking, aren't the losses taken in fortress Bakhmut going to be the best of a bad situation? Which makes them minimized (if hardly minimal) and unfortunately *necessary*, as you seem to say this the rest of what you wrote?

Encircling Bakhmut, even driving all the way to Popasna, maybe nets them a bunch of prisoners but doesn't get them many long term effects on the Russian war effort.

Of course if the opportunity presents itself and they think they can do it with minimal losses who knows what option the Ukrainian's might take but in both their previous major counter offensives in Kherson and Kharkiv focused on not just taking land back but also permentlky straining Russian logistics and making other positions untenable. Unless Ukraine thinks it can unwind a major chunk of the Eastern front in the Donbass it seems other than recapturing ground it would have the least long term strategic consequences for the Russians.

Okay serious answer. No one here is going to know. Ukraine is doing what will give them the best odds at winning the war. Maybe that means waiting a bit longer and softening up Russian defenses with artillery and maybe it means striking tomorrow. Maybe they will have a bunch of new troops and weapons three weeks from now and they’re waiting for that. It also depends on what Russia is doing and what they’re force generation looks like. The less clear it is when Ukraine will attack the higher the odds of success so Ukraine is incentivized to be as ambiguous as possible.

757a757c4e8e6b2d390753a767394087,13mhca0,jkw48jt,"I spent two years in Iraq, talking to a lot of former Ba'ath party folks, and people who lived in Baghdad during the Saddam years.

Saddam Hussein saw himself as an important historical figure, who would finally reunite Kuwait and Iraq.  His tribe (Al-Tikriti) was very involved in the 1930s Free-Kuwaiti movement, which attempted to reunify the two countries by force under Iraqi King Ghazi. So that history was very much in Saddam's mind when he decided to target Kuwait.

By the standards of 1990, Iraq had an incredibly formidable military.  It had well-disciplined and well-trained armor divisions.  It had very well-seasoned and reasonably well-equipped infantry divisions who had fought valiantly in Iran just a few years prior.  It even had a reasonable air force.

Saddam didn't believe the Arab nations around him would coalesce so quickly when he invaded Kuwait.  Beyond that, he also didn't believe that NATO or western powers would involve themselves in what he viewed as a minor, historical, territorial dispute.  Sound familiar?

The fact of the matter is, Saddam believed Americans and western troops could not endure a meatgrinder of a war like he had with Iran.  He and his generals believed a defense in depth strategy would make advancing too costly, and cause casualty numbers that the west would not stomach.

Saddam and his generals were not aware of many of the modern capabilities that the U.S. and the west had.  For example, they had no idea that GPS existed, so they didn't even bother having any units guard the western desert.  Whenever they tried to maneuver in that desert, they would get hopelessly lost due to lack of terrain features.   U.S. armored divisions completely outflanked them with their GPS, and their defense in depth strategy was rendered completely worthless.  Even so, his generals reacted very competently and did the best they could given the situation.

Additionally, Saddam and his generals believed they were impervious to air attacks because Baghdad and other large cities had numerous layers of radar and AA emplacements.  Baghdad was one of the most heavily guarded airspaces in the world.  What did they not account for?  Laser guided bombs and missiles, and aircraft that could stealthily infiltrate those air spaces and take out key AA infrastructure.  Also, frankly, some very audacious early raids by attack helicopters and other aircraft that did massive damage to their AA capability.

U.S. troops who encountered the Republican Guard units stated that they would not surrender even when completely outgunned.  U.S. armored troops reported having to kill every last man of those units because they would not stop fighting.  The M1 Abrams was just too good of a tank for even the very well-trained and seasoned Iraqi troops.

So I guess my point is, from Saddam's standpoint, he thought he was acting rationally.  He severely underestimated the world's resolve, and U.S. technological superiority.

It's an interesting parallel, because in either case, one can see how they might think they could be victorious, but the blunders are pretty obvious in retrospect.",1684590982.0,1684582623.0,t3_13mhca0,t1_jkw26uj,,5,69,0,69,1,0,{'gid_3': 1}

9e8c3dbebe1b4e307e754d8afc019023,13mhca0,jkvultf,"This is a complex question and requires quite a bit of context. 

First if all, we have been under Russian occupation for 300 years with some seldom periods of independence and the last one started in 1991 and has lasted for 32 years so far which was not free of Russia’s attempts to still control us and have a say in our politics. During that time we were enslaved, had our language banned, experienced a genocide and the list goes on. I think you can understand why Ukrainians may not like Russia in general.

Secondly, let’s remember that this war started in 2014 in order to “protect Russian-speaking populace from oppression”, but here’s the deal, there was no such thing at that time. Yes we disliked Russian government and Putin personally, and sure we tried to distance ourselves from Russia politically and otherwise but a large population of Ukraine spoke Russian and were doing absolutely fine. We had Russian TV in our country, some members of our parliament spoke Russian, it was considered cool to go to Moscow to work, we listened to Russian music and watched Russian movies, damn, our passports were bilingual until 2016.

In 2014 the situation changed. A big chunk of population who previously spoke Russian voluntarily switched to Ukrainian but many continued to speak Russian anyway, the opinion on Russian government got even worse than it used to be and Ukrainian soccer fans even came up with a [song](https://youtu.be/447lXe1Y2tE) that goes “Putin is dick, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la” over and over again which was sung during matches for quite a while. Some people became outraged that Russian population was happy with annexation of the Crimea and started hating general Russian populace on this basis. We started implementing laws that promote Ukrainian language and so on and so forth. That being said, there still was no “oppression of Russian-speakers”. I studied in the linguistic university and despite the fact that we have a law that says that all education must be done in Ukrainian, the only course that was taught in Ukrainian is god damn Ukrainian. I personally have not witnessed a single person being discriminated even slightly for speaking Russian but I myself was made fun of for not speaking Russian well on multiple occasions (I was born in rural area were Ukrainian is more popular so I personally used Russian even less than English in my life). Russians could still enter our country without a visa and this law was renewed in January of 2022 while Russia was amassing forces near our border, we made any concessions we could to appease the Russian-speakers and prevent the full-scale invasion.

Then the full-scale invasion started. And the general mood of the population is “ok, we tried being tolerant to them even after 2014, this is how it turned out, no more”. And on one hand I can understand the sentiment. Russians say that those who speak Russian are Russians and should be protected? Ok then, if you speak Russian, you are the enemy, even those who continued speaking Russian after 2014 started switching in 2022 (although we still have Russian speakers who consider themselves Ukrainians). Complete boycott of Russian products and media - in part out of spite, in part in order to reduce the income of Russia. Now come the points I personally disagree with. “There’s no such thing as a good Russian” or “a good Russian is a dead Russian” and I support heavy criticism of Russian government and the general population of Russia for supporting or in the best case not protesting the actions of their government, but it goes too far and people distrust even those who try to help and sometimes advocate for bombing Russian civilians. Then there’s denial of any criticism of Ukraine, which is also understandable - let’s not talk about our problems so that the West doesn’t stop supporting us. But once again it goes too far and any criticism of Ukraine including legitimate is brushed off as Russian propaganda.

I’ve already mentioned that I personally don’t quite like what’s happening now, but I will repeat that I am convinced that this is a side effect of the war. Sauerkraut was called “Liberty cabbage” in the US during WW1 and Japanese were detained without due process during WW2 in the US too, for example.",False,1684574976.0,t3_13mhca0,t1_jkvnk50,,5,12,0,12,0,0,
9e8c3dbebe1b4e307e754d8afc019023,13mhca0,jkvr37o,"Yeah, and while it’s an unpopular opinion I would also add that this new style of propaganda Russia invented is very effective. It’s hard to convince people that something is true, but it’s much easier and effective to convince people that nothing is true. I like Timothy Snyder’s commentary on this, I can find examples if you want.

Speaking about Zelensky, I am very vocal that I voted against him in both rounds of the election and heavily criticised him up until Feb 24 2022. His pre-invasion popularity polls of 38% before the full-scale invasion seem to be accurate. He wasn’t effective with fulfilling his promises (eradicating corruption, settling the conflict with Russia, etc) and I think that my reasoning for voting against him (absolute absence of political experience) was at least a part of the reason for that. That being said, my opinion of him has changed after Feb 24 and his current 90%+ popularity polls also seem to be accurate. People respect his “I don’t need a ride, I need bullets” response, his continued “the President is here, we are fighting” appearances bolstered the morale of our armed forces and the general populace. His actor skills definitely do help with Ukraine absolutely crushing Russia on information front internationally. I can continue, but let’s just say, him being the Times magazine person of the year is fully deserved.

Moving to your question about corruption, everything you read is very much real, this is the plague of our country and the problem with eradicating that is how commonplace it is. It’s not just top officials. Let’s say you try to build a road. The Ministry of Infrastructure will allocate 1B to it and 100M will be “management expenses” which means a new car and a house for the Minister. When those remaining 800M reach the region where the road is supposed to be built, the head of region may take a cut of those 700M. The remaining 600M go to buying asphalt, sand and other stuff you need to build the road, but while they claim that they bought 500M worth of materials, in reality, that 400M worth of materials is actually worth 200M and the rest was split between the supplier and the buyer. And finally the guys who actually do the work may sell a part of those 100M worth of materials to make some money on the side.

And yes, I’ve seen corruption myself. Doctors take bribes to diagnose you with something and in some cases even when you actually have the condition - either you waste a day/week/month battling bureaucracy, or you give them some cash and magically all you need is one signature. Speeding on a highway? Well, nobody got hurt and it’s not such a big deal so the police officer will let it slide with enough motivation. Bad grades at university? The professor likes expensive whiskey (or cash).

It’s like untangling a huge pile of headphones. Besides, I cannot support this claim with any evidence, but I strongly believe that a part of the problem was Russia supporting corruption in our country to keep us in their sphere of influence and I hope the situation will get better after the war ends. That being said I can say with certainty that there is progress in this direction, it’s just not as fast as we wish it to be. Like I have heard from multiple sources that nobody in my university takes bribes while in some places you can’t pass a test without a bribe even if you know the subject better than the professor. However, despite our government being corrupt we have no issues with democracy and this is a very important issue for a large chunk of our population so such changes will be demanded. You can see what happened in 2013 when the demands of the people weren’t heard. And pretty please do not accept us to EU until this problem is solved, this will be an additional motivation for our government to tackle this problem.

And no offence taken for this question, I understand why people are sensitive to discussing Ukraine’s issues, but this is a valid question and perfectly reasonable to be concerned about.

So, not only does keeping some pressure in and around Bakhmut make sense tactically, but it also makes sense strategically. 

The Russians seem to be obsessed with Bakhmut's capture, for some reason (probably Putin), which has made them hurl huge numbers of men and material into that front. They're fixated on feeding that meat grinder to the point that they are shuffling forces from other fronts to try to stop Ukraine's advances... which is likely leaving the south exposed.

Bakhmut has served its purpose: it ground the Russian winter offensive to a halt (alongside other places like Vuhledar, of course, but still), and now it's acting like the proverbial flame for the Russian moths, which creates weakness in other areas along the front. This exposes Russian troops and equipment to long-range strikes due to the necessity of consolidating them at specific transit hubs to move them to the Bakhmut region.

Russia's probably not getting anywhere west of Bakhmut, and they may get enveloped inside of it. We'll see. I just hope that when Ukraine's big punch does come, it hits Russia so hard that they can't recover, and we finally see an end to this war with a free, sovereign Ukraine in control of all of its territory (and then promptly added to both the EU and NATO).",False,1684622049.0,t3_13mhca0,t1_jkydl9l,,5,5,0,5,0,0,
