Day 132 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today Russians fired way more missiles than usual, and they fired them all over the country. Here in Khrakiv they fired them 2 times today, first three missiles at 9pm, two of them were intercepted and the last one landed somewhere on the outskirts of the city. Then they fired 6 more missiles at 12:15am, one of them apparently malfunctioned and fell on the Russian territory, that’s what people from Belgorod said.

I’m pretty sure the remaining missiles did get through, there were many loud explosions, and a big fire started afterwards, it was actually extinguished fairly quickly, but the smoke still continued to rise. There was so much of it, that there’s still the smell of burning everywhere in the city, almost 5 hours after the fire was extinguished.

Don’t know what was hit today, but we do know what was hit yesterday. What did they hit this time? Another school as usual, yeah, why hit military targets, when you can hit an empty school. They must be very scared of education, because schools seem to be their number one priority, at least in Kharkiv. They are hitting a new school every other day. 

At the same time we are destroying a new ammo depot almost every single day now, sometimes even multiple in a single day. Just today another big one was destroyed in the middle of Donetsk.

Journalist asked “why Zelensky said he will attack Transnistria if it will be needed”, his answer (a HUGE surprise for me)

“Well, because there is a war between russia and Ukraine and we have russian troops here, which is destabilising the situation, and ACTUALLY he said that only if russian troops will attack from Transnistria they will have to respond, which makes sense, but Transnistria doesn’t want anything to do with this whole situation”

Asked about why Moldova is arming itself 

“Well, we get that they see a danger, but the danger is not coming from us, we’re constantly talking, and we’re talking about peace, and we understand that this is the official position pf their country- peace. But there are some certain people in a certain security organisation of a country who are trying to destabilise the situation (talking about FSB)”

👉 In the north near Kharkiv no substantive action was reported. 

👉 In the east the russians captured Lysychansk.  As it was a planned, controlled withdraw, there were no mass captures or casualties of Ukrainian troops.  Putin hailed the capture of the city as a great victory and announced an operational pause.  Other russian sources reported the great victory cost russia roughly seven to eight thousand men and the operational pause isn't so much a celebration as it is an exhausted regrouping.

👉 In the south, Ukraine again made [small, but important, advances](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1544094342121488384.html) in their quest to liberate Kherson.   [New Reporting](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/03/ukraine-prepares-a-counter-offensive-to-retake-kherson-province) indicates the battles down south are bigger and bloodier in scope than we have previously heard.  Hard or not, the battle for Kherson **IS** coming, already Ukrainian snipers are in range of the city proper and it's vastly [more strategically important](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1543736206210797569.html) than Lysychansk.

👉 Over the long weekend, I lost count of how many [ammo dumps](https://twitter.com/Haruspexut/status/1543725473280270337), [military bases](https://twitter.com/olliecarroll/status/1543472390507749376), and other logistics targets the Ukrainians hit with their HIMARS systems.  There were at least two train derailments and other partisan attacks that further destabilized russia's position.  Expect this to continue as Ukraine implements NATO's playbook of destroying russian logistics to even the battlefield.

👉 We are seeing the war become harder for Ukraine because [russia decided it was actually in a big war](https://twitter.com/NewYorker/status/1537132839275307011).  The russians were successful in the Donbas because they mobilized men from the occupied Donbas areas and forced them to fight.  That mobilization is now about to happen in Crimea, and in other less obvious ways throughout russia.  There are also reports that russia is already using Kherson civilians as human shields.

👉 Mobilization of manpower is one thing but mobilization of materials is another.  As I reported last week russia is taking ammo from Belarus, and has passed laws allowing it to mobilize private business as it struggles to maintain the war effort.   Add in the HIMARS attacks reported above and it becomes an open question of how successful russia will be in its mobilization if its ability to supply its troops is being destroyed and its ammo is running out.

👉 Here is a list of long reads you might be interested in if you're looking to find the truth of the war for yourself.  Some are repeated from my Friday recap if you were lucky enough to read it before the post was removed.

NATO's 30 allies signed an accession protocol for Finland and Sweden today to allow them to join the nuclear-armed alliance once allied parliaments ratify the decision.

The move, which is the most significant expansion of the alliance since the mid-1990s, means Helsinki and Stockholm can participate in NATO meetings and have greater access to intelligence.

However, they will not be protected by the NATO defence clause that an attack on one ally is an attack against all until ratification - which is likely to take up to a year.

""This is truly an historic moment,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said alongside the foreign ministers of the two countries. 

""With 32 nations around the table, we will be even stronger.""

In a statement, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said: ""Thank you for your support! Now the process of ratification by each of the allies begins.

""Look forward to working together in ensuring our collective security.""

Very interesting article. Some highlights:

Sources from the Austrian television channel ORF reported that the suspension was due to the transfer of data on the Russian neurotoxin Novichok to former Wirecard top manager Jan Marsalek, who fled to Russia after the Wirecard embezzlement scandal and collaborated with Russian special services.

>Peterlik served as Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2018 to 2020. He worked under the leadership of Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl. Later, Kneisl joined the board of directors of Rosneft.

>Jan Marselek has been put on the wanted list by the authorities of Germany, Austria and some other countries due to suspicions of having links with Russian intelligence. In 2020, the German company Wirecard, which he manages, collapsed after auditors drew attention to a hole in the balance sheet of almost 2 billion euros.

Give one enough money to re-build their house, and they will spend that money hiring their neighbors to do the construction work, so the money will still be in the village. With a little creative use of IOUs, the entire village of houses can get re-built for the ‘price’ of one.



The construction industry is largely a domestic industry. Ukrainian lumber-mills will thrive, and be hiring. Ukrainian brick-factories will thrive, and be hiring. The support that Ukraine needs will be in the machinery that those industries need. Ukraine will need a ton of mill-saws, and trucks, and brick-forming machines.

But I don’t think that the Ukrainian generals have any intention of fighting this war on Russia’s terms.



The slow to non-existent movement of front-lines is presented as evidence that it’s a war of attrition. But I have a very strong suspicion that Ukraine is preparing for a much more advanced military operation. The success, or failure, of advanced-strategy warfare hinges on preparation and planning. Market Garden failed because of insufficient preparation and planning. The lunge for Kyiv failed because of insufficient preparation and planning. You really really don’t want to attempt a complex military maneuver before you are ready, before everything is in place, and before all precautions have been taken.



The build-up for D-day seemed to take forever. The build-up for the Iraq invasion seemed to take forever. There were attritional elements going in to both of those, the war of attrition is not detached from advanced-strategy fighting, but it’s specific and targeted. Often there are missions that are meant to obfuscate what the strategic objectives are. It’s confusing because it’s supposed to be confusing.

It has to somewhat clear to them that they'll still just be a backward pariah state if they simply plan on semi normalized relations with just India and China.  Even then China and India likely won't want to depend on a singular source of raw materials as its extremely risky throwing all of your resource needs into one basket (Cough cough.... Germany).  So to that end I think the Kremlin has to find a way to reintroduce itself to the west.  

My only thought right now as it corelates to their strategy on the field, is that Russia is trying its hardest to get as much leverage as possible to by the end of the year try and lock down the conflict and push for negotiations.  Then turn around and relent and give enough of a carrot on the negotiation front to make some of the western ""allies"" push for Ukraine to give in. (I could see this being something like giving up Kherson city but Russia would keep the land bridge and returning all of occupied Kharkiv oblast.  

I'm not at all saying this would work, to the contrary I believe its another stupid gamble, but its the only way I can look at what Russia is doing on the field and make any reasonable sense as to what their desired outcome will be.  They can't keep up the way they've been fighting for much longer, they're simply throwing bodies and unreplaceable resources WW1 style at taking marginal gains on a fairly broad front against a highly motivated and increasingly better armed opponent.

So many supply dumps getting destroyed in that area makes me think that the rumored Ukrainian offensive could be centered around liberating Donetsk Oblast while Kherson is simultaneously liberated. My reasoning for believing this is that those are the two anchor points of Russian operations in the South. All the supplies are run up from Crimea and from there everything from Kherson out to Eastern Donetsk Oblast is administered to. So in theory of both of those points were hit either the Russians would lose a huge chunk of their manpower being such between those areas, or the Russians would have to pull back to Crimea to save that manpower.

If the DPR, which is now estimated to be at or over 50% total casualties, was to be pushed to a breaking point could what remains of their civilian government be enticed to sign an act of conditional surrender in order to push them out of the war completely and deprive Russia of a major ally in country?",False,1656995166.0,t3_vrp2s0,t3_vrp2s0,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

What Ukraine needs now: 

- Anti-radiation seekers for loitering munitions to suppress or destroy Russian EW complexes.

- Multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to target and destroy Russian logistics and ammunition stockpiles to starve Russian artillery of ammunition.

- 155-mm howitzers and ammunition to prevent Russian troop concentration and support Ukrainian troop concentrations.

- Secure communications systems.

- Anti-tank guided weapons and man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS).

- Protected mobility to enable Ukrainian troops to manoeuvre under artillery threat.

- Point defences to protect critical infrastructure.

It is also necessary for Ukraine to receive training at scale to form new units able to undertake offensive operations and to receive staff and junior leadership training to support the orchestration of combined arms offensive manoeuvre.",1657053059.0,1657052881.0,t3_vrp2s0,t3_vrp2s0,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

The sole Russian advantage relative to the botched Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is better terrain (vast plains).

In the whole Soviet-Afghan war, they had around 14k fatalities. A relative proportion of 2 KIA per 100 troops. In full 9 years of war.

26ab6c423e2171ff4278b8ddeae3d0e5,vrp2s0,ieyhsi8,"Putin likely has no exit strategy. But he doesn't need one if he's dying. His plan would therefore be to grab as much territory as possible (ideally at least all the Donbass, Crimea, water for Crimea, and a land bridge to Crimea - all of which he has done) before he dies. He can then leave a legacy as somebody who expanded Russia, even though the war goes on.

*Then* the new Russian government can let the conflict freeze, maybe suggesting a temporary ceasefire and negotiations, which Ukraine will eventually agree to if they can't mount an effective counteroffensive. The Russians will allow a new normal to form, similar to 2014-2022 but with a new frozen frontline further in Ukraine.

It'd take years of that, but if Russia just claims that they're done but keeping what they have, then slowly the West will lose interest. Particularly since it'll be a new slightly less crazy or obviously evil leader who will be making overtures to the West. Relations normalize slowly. Much to Ukraine's chagrin, sanctions ease in exchange for Russia returning POWs or other small concessions (the West will *want* the sanctions gone, so will relax them for any small concession they can sell to their populations). Ukraine stays mad but unable to do anything about it as aid dries up or starts becoming limited to non-lethal and/or rebuilding aid.

A generation later Russia is back to being a geopolitical opponent that can be worked with and traded with. It's a bit closer to China maybe, but it already was. Ukraine is in a Georgia/South Ossetia/Abkhazia situation indefinitely. Ukraine maybe doesn't even join NATO or the EU out of anger. Though probably they'll join the EU under some special condition that the EU is not obliged to defend Ukraine territorial integrity aside from what it currently holds.

Eventually this is called a historical grievance and even Ukrainians start to accept the new normal.

The above possibility is why those closest to Putin didn't overwhelmingly oppose and stop him. They may have if he wasn't dying. He's the face of Russian evil and a motivator for Western populations to put pressure on their governments to continue the fight. If he survived in charge for another decade then the West would keep up the pressure and aid, and Russia would keep bleeding with no end in sight. But enough of those in power know that the situation can be temporary. Putin may not have an endgame, but this is Russia's endgame now that their original goals have failed.

The best case of the above scenario is one where Ukraine rebuilds really successfully, continues democratizing and rooting out corruption, and becomes a modern liberal democracy. Maybe eventually its soft power will influence the Russian people to demand more from their own state. But probably not because the values of the Russian people are truly a bit alien to the West.

I hope this doesn't come to pass. I hope Ukraine can take back territory. I hope the Russian people rise up against Putin. But the above could happen, and it explains the thinking of those in Russia outside of Putin (and maybe even Putin's thinking - he may be practical enough to realize this may occur and leave him with a still positive legacy in the eyes of the people).

If we want to avoid the above scenario, we HAVE TO KEEP CALLING TWEETING AND WRITING OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. Vote out those who want to appease. Demand more and better lethal aid to Ukraine. Demand that *we*, the entire West, must win. The Ukrainians can do this with our help, but they need much more than they're getting now.",False,1657037567.0,t3_vrp2s0,t1_iey7vfj,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

The key quote is:
> It annoys me when we focus on individual politicians. You can look at any actor of the last 30 years—their actions have always been an expression of a broad social consensus. We have to be honest and look at ourselves.


Now, obviously he's saying this to shift the blame off Merkel and his party, and I disagree with that. When all's said and done, she was in charge. If she disagreed, she could have warned the country and resigned. And she would have had her ""told you so"" moment. Instead she chose to ignore the problem (at the very least), stay in power, and hope for the best. And now she's responsible.


Having said that, he's fundamentally right.


There's three key internal policies dictated Germany's attitude towards Russia:

* a balanced budget. Much easier when you don't have to spend money on the military. And _that_ requires peaceful neighbours (in the broad sense).

* no nuclear power. That requires steady and secure supplies of cheap natural gas, _especially_ when you want to shift towards solar and wind (because only gas power plants have the flexibility necessary to accommodate the associated power fluctuation).

* a certain ""peacenik"" view that holds that war is bad (fair enough), that Germany shouldn't get involved, ever (err...), all the way to believing that when war happens, it's because neither parties wanted peace enough (right). Can't say that when there's an unchecked imperialistic power two countries over.


Individually, those policies each covered a majority of the voters.  Altogether, maybe 95%, none really disagreeing with any.


That's where the whole idiotic ""we'll pacify Russia through economic engagement"" came from.


Germans needed to believe, no, _wanted to believe_ that Russia was peaceful, or at least peacefully managed, because otherwise they would have been forced to abandon their cherished internal policy choice(s). They deluded themselves. That was the ""broad social consensus"" that led Germany astray.


And I see little evidence of being ""honest"" and ""looking at ourselves"". Beck in that debate is particularly insufferable. She talks about Nordstream 2 as if her party's - her own - energy policy had nothing to do with it. She argues for funding the military with ""principles"" she would have rubbished if Merkel had proffered them 3 year ago.

 >The war in Donbas was an armed conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine, part of the broader Russo-Ukrainian War. In March 2014, immediately following the Euromaidan protest movement and subsequent Revolution of Dignity, protests by pro-Russian, anti-government separatist groups arose in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, collectively called the Donbas. These demonstrations began around the same time as Russia's annexation of Crimea, and were part of wider pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine.

You can't ""dust off"" some old oil field just like that. It takes quite some time in order to set it up again, repair the equipment, hire people to work there, etc.  You can't snap your fingers and expect it to start producing oil overnight.

So there is a sizeable investment before you can extract oil from there, both time and money wise.

Then, by the time you get to extract oil, you have no idea what the price will be. So it's a risk and I doubt some old abandoned oil fields are going to see some action just because the price of oil was high enough for a period of time.

In fact, if you look at the US, they are begging oil companies to exploit thousands of permits and the companies are like ""nah, bro, stop calling me, I'm not your daddy!""

The prices are going down because OPEC started pumping an extra 600k barrels a day at the beginning of July.

High prices are nice, sure, they bring a profit, but in the long term they are disastrous for the oil industry, a lesson OPEC learned the hard way back in the 80s when they wanted high oil prices and they ended up with legislation all over the world to cut oil consumption, from more efficient car engines to new environmental laws for emissions and all that.

The high oil prices we had/still have right now are a blimp, mainly because we are coming out of the pandemic, because of the war in Ukraine, and because we are heading towards a recession.

The last batch, 150,000 rounds, is to be ordered from US producers. Apparently to diversify sources and avoid drawing down any more of the US's direct stocks (DoD press briefing from the 30th or 1st, I forget).

That same press briefing had a back and forth with one of the reporters about Ukraine and hitting Russian targets in Ukraine. One of the ways to read the DoD's statement was that Ukraine had been given >100km weapons by the US. The next day, Ukraine hit a target 100km behind the lines; not definitive, as Ukraine's own Tochka system can get that far back. Also note that Russia is now defending bridges in Crimea against guided weapons.

HIMARS reloads were handled under drawdown, so those are coming straight from Army warehouses.

The rest of the package was kept secret, as you say.

I don't doubt that's true, but let's also try to quantify it briefly.

Let's start by assuming that Republicans take both chambers of Congress this November.  Let's even assume they do so with a 10 point margin in both chambers, that is 55% of seats to 45%.

Now, not all Republicans are Trumpists of course—but for the sake of argument let's be generous and assume they are.  By your anecdotal guesstimate, that puts 60% of the GOP's 55% of seats—equal to one third of each chamber—against supporting Ukraine.  The remaining 40% of the GOP's 55% of seats, together with most of the Dem's 45% of seats—equal to two thirds of each chamber—will be for supporting Ukraine.  So I think we can assume Congress will steadfastly remain behind supporting Ukraine no matter what happens this November.  And of course, Joe will still be President.

That would be a hostile act toward Russia,” Putin warned U.S. Undersecretary for Political Affairs William J. Burns, who is now director of the CIA, in the weeks leading up to NATO’s 2008 Bucharest Summit.

There has never been a time when Ukraine joining NATO was acceptable for Russia. They may have been too weak to carry out such threats, but it was nonetheless always unacceptable in Russian foreign policy circles. 

And, pre 2008 it was never a real possibility. There was no domestic support in Ukraine to do so outside of the most nationalist politicians who lacked public support. Support to join NATO was consistently below 30% in Ukraine.

The truth is somewhere in-between.  Axiom is saying they'd love a contract modification and $$$ to provide attitude control in 2024, but that isn't exactly a delivered solution, either.

The truth is, the ISS may not be ""worth it"" without Russian cooperation.

Just like the Crusades were often a ""make work"" project for too many knights around, the ISS's principal goal was to keep Russian missile engineers busy so that they didn't sell their proceeds to the lowest bidder abroad.
