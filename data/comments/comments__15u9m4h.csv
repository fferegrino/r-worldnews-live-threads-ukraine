>  
>...  
>  
>The distinguished German historian of Eastern Europe Karl Schlögel has described Putinism succinctly: “a violence-based order following on the demise of a continental empire and a system of state socialism” rooted in a “Soviet-Stalinist DNA … It includes the targeted killing of political opponents, commonplace violence in prisons and camps, impunity for crimes, arbitrariness, conspiracy myths, the notion of ‘enemies of the people.’”5  
>  
>In his now notorious historical essay “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians” from the summer of 2021, Putin flatly — and not for the first time — denied Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent country; it was, he wrote, a component (together with Belarus) of a “single large nation, a triune nation.”6 The Kremlin has repeatedly made it clear that only Ukraine’s complete surrender, including the relinquishment of its sovereignty, is acceptable as the basis for a peace agreement.  
>  
>This maximalist intransigence is by no means limited to Ukraine. On December 17, 2021, the Kremlin sent two similar “draft treaties” to the White House and to NATO headquarters in Brussels which articulated the Kremlin’s goals for Europe with remarkable clarity.7 The demands in the proposals — which were immediately dismissed by their recipients — included not just a veto on Ukrainian membership in the alliance but a revision of the Euro-Atlantic security acquis of the post-Cold War period on enlargement, basing, deployments, exercises, and cooperation with partners. They would have severely limited U.S. freedom of movement in Europe (with no concomitant limitations on Russia), reversed 25 years of Central and Eastern European integration into NATO and the European Union, ended the right of non-members to choose their own alliances, and re-established a Russian sphere of influence on the continent.8 The coup de grâce was the final stipulation (Art. 7) of the draft U.S.-Russia treaty, that all nuclear weapons should be returned to their national territories: it would have meant the end of the U.S. nuclear umbrella over Europe and thus quite possibly of the alliance itself.  
>  
>As my Brookings colleagues Fiona Hill and Angela Stent have warned: “This war is about more than Ukraine. … Ukrainians and their supporters understand that in the event of a Russian victory, Putin’s expansionism would not end at the Ukrainian border. The Baltic states, Finland, Poland, and many other states that were once part of the Russian empire would be at risk of attack or overthrow from within.”9  
>  
>Konrad Schuller, the Eastern Europe correspondent of the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, adds that the proponents of negotiations misjudge the categorical nature of this hostility: “In the case of total enmity, compromise never serves anything but a tactical pause.” This approach, he writes, has “deep roots in the Soviet Union,” and has been demonstrated time and again by Putin, as in the systematic violation of the Minsk agreements from the outset.10  
>  
>...  
>  
>... NATO, as well as the European Union, will have to continue to radically rethink their security provisions and address their huge deficits in deterrence and defense. Given the evolving U.S. presidential election campaign, Europeans especially will have to do more (much more) to defend themselves. As long as Russia is internally totalitarian and externally neo-imperial, Europe’s security can only be defined against Moscow.

Sir Lawrence Freedman, a British military strategist, agrees: “They’re doing stuff and they’re stretching the Russians."" ... “deep battle and the close battle”

According to British intelligence, as of July 2023 the 58th Army is defending against the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Zaporozhye region.

In July of 2023 the previous commander of the 58th Major General Ivan Popov was fired by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu after complaining about inadequacies in logistics that led to high casualties among his men and accusing his superiors of treason. The day before his firing the army's headquarters in Berdiansk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast was destroyed by a missile strike.

The incoming commander Arkady Marzoyev is a veteran of Chechen Wars. He had previously commanded the 22nd Army Corps in Crimea since 2021. This is the main combat unit of the Russian army on the occupied peninsula. 

On February 24, 2022, Marzoev sent paratroopers of the 247th Airborne Assault Regiment to advance on Kherson, assuring the officers that reconnaissance had been carried out and the route to the city was free. However the column was famously ambushed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, suffering heavy losses. In February - March 2022, he led the attack on Mykolaiv, which failed to reach their objective. The 247th under the command of Marzoev was surrounded and almost completely destroyed near Mykolaiv. The C/O of the 247th Dmitry Lisitskiy famous shot himself in March of 2023 to protest Marzoev's lack of accountability for his unit's losses. 

22nd Army Corps was later in the news for having their ammo stores reportedly destroyed in the 2022 Chornobaivka attacks.

The film was shot and released very rapidly after receiving funding from Russia's Ministry of Culture in October of 2022. The movie was further funded by Russia's Ministry of Defense and the Military-Patriotic Movie Support Fund. The movie was produced by Sofia Mitrofanova, former Gazprom-Media executive. 
>
>The plot concerns a Belgian violinist and his manager who end up in Kyiv (in February of 2022) - after which a full-scale war begins. He becomes an eyewitness to the horrible crimes that, according to the script, are being committed by the Ukrainian military. In the headquarters where they torture the protagonist and other civilians a golden profile of Hitler hangs on the wall, and the book ""Mein Kampf"" lies on the table.
> 
> The film ends with the text that the rocket attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk (April 8, 2022), the blowing up of the maternity hospital (March 9, 2022) and the drama theater (March 16, 2022) in Mariupol, as well as the massacres in Bucha and the shelling of Donetsk with Makiivka These are the crimes of the Kiev regime. And Ukraine deliberately blamed Russia for this in order to ""denigrate it in the eyes of the world community."" Then a line appears stating that ""The Witness"" is dedicated to the memory of all those who died.

Ukrainians have made recent advances in Robotyne using Leopard tanks causing Russians to abandon positions. I am very interested in the fate of Robotyne. It seems it has been on the verge of falling for a while but it appears there has been major progress in recent days. 

How quickly is this town likely to fall? Days? or weeks? I have also read that this is where the most substantial layer of the Surovikin line is. Is this true? If this is breached, will advances to Tokmak be speedier or will towns on the way such as Novoprokopivka be similarly stubborn obstacles?

I understand that to Putin these people are nothing but statistics and yet i can’t feel anything else but total disgust that someone is willing to throw away so many lives for absolutely nothing of value.

Say what you want about the United States during the Vietnam War but at least people within the White House felt guilt and even shame for continuing the Vietnam War meanwhile i doubt a single person within the Kremlin feels guilt or shame for invading Ukraine and sacrificing so much for so little.

> Majority against delivery of Taurus to Ukraine 

> 52 percent of eligible voters believe that Germany should not supply Ukraine with the cruise missiles, which can be used against targets at greater distances, while 36 percent are in favor. At 40 percent, approval is significantly higher among West Germans than among East Germans (21 percent). Twelve percent are unable or unwilling to take a position on the issue.

> Looking at party supporters, the highest level of agreement is found among the Greens: 68 percent are in favor of delivery, 23 percent against. A majority of FDP supporters, 56 percent, are also in favor of the delivery, while the AfD has the lowest level of support, 18 percent.

> The picture is almost split among CDU/CSU (45 percent in favor, 48 percent against) and, above all, among SPD supporters: among the Social Democrats, 42 percent are both in favor and 42 percent against the delivery of the cruise missiles, with which Ukraine says it will not attack targets on Russian territory.

The talk has been because if Ukraine can take and hold Melitopol, and destroy the Kursk bridge, they will have effectively cut Crimea and the troops south west of Melitopol off from the rest of the Russian held territories.  

The next question you're probably going to ask is ""Why is Crimea so important?""  Besides the whole ""It belongs to Ukraine"" thing, multiple reasons:

1. It houses about 1/3rd of the Russian logistical support network.
2. Ukraine probably knows Russian Army's fallback plans, and that plan probably is to have the troops in the south retreat to Crimea and set up a perimeter if they get cut off logistically.
3. With the Ukraine Army setting up a Crimean perimeter, and Russians not being able to conduct a major offensive, all of the troops to the south will be effectively removed from the fight.  The logistics of getting food to these troops, let alone fuel and ammunition to these troops, will become an nightmare.

Melitopol makes the most sense but it's more about cutting off Crimea from Russia. 

It's not the only option though. They could have gone east through Donbass, south to isolate Crimea (probably by taking Melitopol), or somehow drive to Crimea and take it. 

The Melitopol option seemed the most likely and strategically beneficial if they could pull it off and Russia's heavy southern defenses kind of demonstrate that.

The idea would be take Melitopol cutting of land routes to Crimea from Russia, choke Crimea further by cutting off the Kerch Strait Bridge, move all the sweet Himars and artillery south and closer to Crimea and start pounding the shit out of it like they did Kherson.

Please, Ukraine was and as far as I know still is the poorest country in Europe. They were a non-NATO member mostly unprepared for this war. They had some brief training for their troops by NATO instructors, but that's about it. And what little heads up they had that Russia was going to invade seemed not to be taken too seriously.

In contrast the Baltic countries have been NATO members for years. Their military has been brought up to and kept at NATO standards for years and given loads of the best equipment NATO has. And not only that but they each have NATO units within their borders already in the event that Russia does try something. They'd have incredible protection of their ports unlike Ukraine, plus a much more robust air force compared to Ukraine.

Specifically the debate we've had before was whether the line of trenches that ran north of Robotyne was the first line or just forward positions - the consensus seems to have been that it was forward positions.  Then there's a ""second"" real line of trenches between Robotyne and Verbove, but this includes two rows of trenches so maybe you could call it two sets.  A ""third"" line runs south of Verbove, and a ""fourth"" south of that.   Then a ""fifth"" set that circles around Tokmak. There's 2-3 km between each.

Poland did impose a ban on imports of *certain* agricultural products from Ukraine, but other than that, it has not imposed some kind of general economic blockade on Ukraine, lol. In fact, Poland has been a major transit point for humanitarian aid and military supplies to Ukraine. Poland has also provided financial assistance to Ukraine, and has taken in over 2 million Ukrainian refugees. They have been a massive help. What country has helped Russia, the way Poland helped Ukraine? Russia is the isolated one. They have to stoop so low as to beg Little Kim for weapons. The statement that ""having Ukraine in ruins is beneficial for Poland since it can attract tons of workers from Ukraine who are working for pennies"" is not supported by evidence. That's just you making a baseless claim. There is no evidence that Poland wants Ukraine to be in ruins. In fact, Poland has a vested interest in a strong and prosperous Ukraine. A strong and prosperous Ukraine would be a stable neighbor for Poland, and would help to deter Russian aggression. Poland and the USA help Ukraine in many ways. Tens of billions in military aid. Economic aid. Humanitarian aid. Diplomatic aid. Military training and so on. I was always taught that in geopolitics everything is only about own interests.
