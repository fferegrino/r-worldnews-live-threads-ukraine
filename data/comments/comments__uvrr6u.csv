For twenty years of my diplomatic career I nave seen different forms of foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24 of this
year. 

The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people
but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia. With a letter Z crossing out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country.

Those who conceived this war want only one thing - to remain in power forever. live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage
and cost of  the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and impunity.

To achieve that they are wiling to sacrifice as many lives as it taxes. Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.

I regret to admit that over all these twenty years the level of lies and unprofessional work in the Foreign Ministry has been increasing all the time. However, in most recent years, this has become simply catastrophic. 

Instead of unbiased information, impartial analysis and forecasts, there are propaganda cliches in the spint of Soviet newspapers ol the 1930s. A system has
been built that deceives instead.

Minister Lavrov is a good illustration of the degradation of this system. In 18 years he went from a professional and educated intellectual, whom my colleagues held in such high esteem, to a person who constantly broadcasts conflicting statements and threatens the world (that is, Russia too) with nuclear weapons!

Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy. It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves the interests of the few, the very few people. Thus, contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill conceived policy.

From CNN's Lindsay Isaac

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the rebuilding of his country after the war with Russia a “huge economic opportunity,” in an address at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

“We will destroy our neighbor and rebuild entire cities and industries,” in the largest rebuilding effort since the World War II, he pledged. Zelensky also outlined a plan which will offer companies to take “patronage” of rebuilding different areas in Ukraine.

“We are offering a historical opportunity” he said, and urged the global community to assist in the effort. “Post-war rebuilding could be fast and efficient,” the President said, adding it will “attract the best.”",False,1653308547.0,t3_uvrr6u,t3_uvrr6u,,0,69,0,69,0,0,

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking remotely to the World Economic Forum, telling business leaders what more needs to be done to support his country during the war with Russia.

Here are the key actions he called for:

Stronger sanctions on Russia

A key theme of Zelensky's speech was his desire that countries should go further in crippling Russia economically. He said he didn't believe any ""maximum"" measures were currently in place, but ""there should be""

The main sanctions he said he wanted to see are: a full embargo on Russian oil, all Russian banks barred from global systems, and all trade with with Russia abandoned

More weapons

As with many of his video speeches, President Zelensky called for more artillery, saying Ukraine needs ""all the weapons that we ask for, not just the ones that have been provided""

He added that tens of thousands of lives would have been saved if Kyiv had received ""100% of our needs at once back in February"" when the war began

An agreement to ensure 'brute force' won't rule the world

Pointing to the WEF's theme for this year - history at a turning point - Zelensky said this was a vital moment for attendees to decide whether ""brute force will rule the world""

Businesses to quit Russia and invest in Ukraine

Zelensky said it was vital for any businesses still in Russia to cease operations immediately, and insisted they should instead put their money into rebuilding Ukraine

He said this was vital for any company that wanted to be sure it hadn't unwittingly funded the ""blood interests"" of Russia

Today shelling continued, at least a couple times explosions were reported in different districts, and around 5 hours ago some cruise (or ballistic) missiles were fired in the direction of Kharkiv.

Imports into Russia have fallen 2020 levels due to “measures from unfriendly states”, which have led to logistical difficulties, a deputy head of Russia’s customs service has said, state agency RIA news reports.

Ruslan Davydov said deliveries from the north-west had seen the highest decrease due to port closures and bans on Russian ships.

“In addition, we see that in the Baltic countries and Poland, cargoes are artificially slowed down and subjected to 100% inspection,” Davydov said, adding that this represented an “economic war” against Russia.

Austin thanked the defense ministers from the other 40 nations for attending and highlighted the progress made since the first contact group meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany last month, spotlighting Australia, Canada and the UK for military equipment they have provided to Ukraine since that meeting.

Since last month’s contact group meeting, Australia and Canada “committed to providing M777 Howitzers, and in just four weeks, all those systems have been delivered to the Ukrainians,” Austin said. The UK also “delivered brimstone missiles and a new short-range defense system,” and “many countries have pushed hard to stand up important new training missions, and we’ve watched these efforts make a real difference in real time,” he added. 

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, the deputy commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces and Ukraine’s defense intelligence representative joined the virtual meeting. Four new countries also joined the meeting who were not in attendance at Ramstein last month: Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Ireland and Kosovo. 

Austin said he knows the other defense ministers on the call “understand the threat that Russian aggression poses to European security and to the rules-based international order that keeps us all secure.”

“Ukraine’s cause has rallied the free world. Since Russia’s invasion on the 24th of February more than 40 of our allies and partners from around the globe have stepped up to provide critical security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself, and today we’re honored to have defense leaders from 44 countries with us, as well as representatives from NATO and the EU,” Austin said.
Today’s contact group meeting will “begin with presentations by Ukraine and US military leadership on the situation on the ground,” Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, Eurasia, said. Session one will “begin with a battlefield update on the current fight, how Ukraine is leveraging international donations, and Ukraine’s immediate combat requirements,” she added. 

Session two of the meeting will focus on “participating ministers” who “will announce progress made on donations,” to Ukraine, and session three will focus “on capabilities and coordination with a review of how we are meeting Ukraine’s priority requirements and overview of the international deconfliction and coordination cell and updates by ministers,” Cooper added.

“Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has confirmed the accuracy of the Polish government’s determination to become completely independent from Russian gas. We always knew that Gazprom was not a reliable partner,” Anna Moskwa tweeted.

Their well-documented and much-discussed issues of bad communication, ineffective leadership and lacking equipment hinder their offensive efforts every time, so I won’t believe they can pull off any successful strategic manoeuvring until I see it with my own eyes.

- 2nd - demilitarized ukraine - UA has pre USSR weapons/tanks. Russia only destroyed old weapons/ammunations/tanks. Other countries - uk/us/japan/german/turkey supplied UA modern weapons instead. More weapons (modern) than before.


Unofficial objectives


- NATO expansion by ukraine. Failed again because Finland/Sweden officially applied to be NATO counties.


- Protect Russian culture in UA - now they wont. people turn away from it. Russia will be forgotten.


- Economy is in trouble. Inflation is high, salary/finances cut by 40%.


- Russia is now an island. Nobody wants to do business with russia - intelectual/culture/education/medical/anything with russia.

Also do not forget the large number of Neo-Nazis in the pro-Russian ~~separatist~~ terrorist ""DPR"", The warlord leader of the DPR gave an award to one of their fighters, and lo and behold he just had a big old nazi patch on during a major press release.

So you need to assume that the Ukrainians are hurting a lot too. They've likely lost a significant percentage of their own equipment. This is especially true now. Ukraine has lost a few battles that they committed - this is no longer early in the war where the Russians were bypassing strong points and getting destroyed by ambushes at little cost to the Ukrainian forces. 
2. 700,000 starts to get pretty minor once you look at it. Ukraine has to defend the entire Russian border, Odessa, and have substantial presence near Belarus and Transnistria in case of Russian incursions from those directions. They may also be counting a substantial number of people managing the supply train or training new troops. Add to that logistical problems. Ukraine does not have control of its own airspace - it is contested. That means it can be problematic to move large formations of troops OR supplies to the front lines. They may simply be at the limits of their supply in the Donbas region. So the Russians may still have a local numerical advantage in Donbas.",False,1653313719.0,t3_uvrr6u,t1_i9oi61a,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

1. Infantry moves slower. That means that Ukraine must spread them out. Too much infantry in one place will just get blown up.

2. Tanks / vehicles move faster, meaning they can always appear ""where they are needed"" on the battlefield. Traveling at 30mph over an hour is possible with cars, but legs will only travel at maybe 3mph over long distances.

This kind of speed advantage can lead to small-scale attacks by Russia where Russia locally outnumbers Ukraine. True, Ukraine's infantry has more friends nearby, but it will still take hours for those friends to come by and help even if they're just 5 miles away (how long does it take for YOU to walk 5 miles? What if you're carrying a 50-lb Javelin?)

---------

Russian units can mass and maneuver to where they are needed. They are far more expensive, and every tank / IFV / APC that Ukraine destroys reduces Russia's ability to conduct large-scale attacks. But Ukraine themselves need an ability to maneuver and ""keep up"" with the Russian attacks on the front.

/u/stirly80 is a regular contributor to these threads (229 of them now over 89 days), as such s/he is very aware of the ebbs and flows of the war.  Also very aware that there are a myriad of different ways this war can go.  Here are a few...

1. Putin doesn't die, but russia's collapse continues until it is driven from the country pre-2014 borders.

2. The war stalemates at the current lines and we get a frozen conflict.

3. with or without putin dying russia is driven back to the 2014 borders where the war stalemates.

4. russia is driven out of ukraine but ukraine is unable to retake crimea.

5. russia manges to stalemate the war with the new donbas borders (post-border recognition but pre-invasion).

And that's just a few.  Lots more like -- pulling a Chechnya, russia gets its ass kicked, goes off, licks its wounds, regroups, comes back and wins the second round stuff.  All with varying degrees of probability (hint, the greatest degree of probability right now is -- with or without putin -- a complete russian collapse out of Ukraine mainland with lesser probability of Ukraine also retaking Crimea).

You on the other hand, have not really participated in the threads and when you finally did it was this poorly thought out post that listed three very remote possibilities that are unlikely to happen (Putin, most likely, is not going to die anytime in the immediate future; the west is not going to get tired; nobody is going to start using nukes ).

In the future, consider phrasing your post as a question like...  ""I only see these three possibilities for the war... (list possibilities), am I missing something?""

You know that our troops always had the power to shoot-and-kill enemies without being charged for crimes, right? Like, fucking Vietnam.

Just because you're ignorant of war and war-powers doesn't mean you're actually making a valid argument here. USA troops always had this power.

Giving criminal prosecutions to war-opponents is downright stupid. That's just not how war works. Ukraine is killing entire BTGs who tries to cross a river without giving them warrants or notices that they're trying to kill them. That's fine. That's how war works. Its unfortunate, but that's the reality.

Same thing with Afghanistan or Iraq. Enemies in a war are targetted and killed. Happened in WW2, happened in Korea, happened in Vietnam, happened in Afghanistan. There's no slippery slope here, just ignorance as you woke up to the horrors of war.


Anyone who has studied war understands these unfortunate facts. War opponents can't be given warrants or otherwise given advance notice of their impending death. You want to surprise them and kill them, even through secretive ambushes if necessary. If they surrender, fine. Treat them well. But war is war.

They'll make gains here and there but they started a war of attrition with a force that's prepared to take the risk to kill every last one of them, though obviously they'll collapse as a force long before that.

But there is another fear — raised recently by prominent politicians on the right and on the left — of slipping into an acceptance of what is often called an Anglo-Saxon multicultural model, in which ethnic communities live separately, even autonomously.

The idea that this model, or “communautarisme,” should be so repellent can be baffling to Anglo-Saxons, largely understood by the French to be British and Americans who, for the most part, stopped thinking of themselves exclusively in such narrow terms long ago.

France’s idea of an Anglo-Saxon model has meant many things over the last century, sometimes referring to liberal capitalism, rampant individualism, consumerism or, in the view of President Charles de Gaulle, the threat of a global hegemony based on American power and the English language.

But today the perceived Anglo-Saxon threat is about the breakdown of France into distinct communities based on ethnic identity. Prime Minister Manuel Valls referred to this obliquely in criticizing a New York Times article about the European experience of Muslim women, who described a day to day “struggle.” Mr. Valls, a Socialist, stressed that “France, as distinct from other countries, does not see itself as a juxtaposition of communities, each with their autonomous path.”

Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president now seeking his conservative party’s nomination for next year’s presidential election, was more explicit in his latest book. Calling for a muscular defense of the French identity, he wrote, “We are not like the Anglo-Saxons who let communities live side by side, ignoring each other and at any rate not mixing.”

The issue is not just whether the French model, which emphasizes integration or assimilation into a single identity, is succeeding or not these days. The question is also why the British and American experience with immigration is viewed through such a skewed lens.

Both countries have long traditions of tolerating multiple identities and community-based politics, which produces candidates who represent ethnic groups and their concerns.

Unlike France, the United States and Britain allow census figures on ethnic origins and religious affiliations, and celebrations of diverse identities are encouraged.

That is not to say that racism and de facto segregation are not stubborn realities in the United States and Britain, with issues like police violence against black men growing more visible rather than less. This year, appeals to nativist sentiments helped propel Britain’s decision to leave the European Union and are fueling Donald J. Trump’s campaign for president. In both countries, economic and social mobility can be limited by race and ethnicity.

Still, that hardly adds up to societies divided into autonomous neighborhoods that shun contact with one another, an exaggeration that would surprise recent immigrants who live in the swirling mix of cultures that define London, New York and other cities.

So what is it that makes the Anglo-Saxon model so scary to the French today? Emile Chabal, a professor of modern French history at the University of Edinburgh, traces it to France’s deeply held faith in a single, indivisible republic that makes no distinction among its citizens.

“Within French republicanism, which is today the dominant political language, the fear of fragmentation is very powerful and very real,” Mr. Chabal said in an interview. “This means any political process that is seen to encourage that — community leaders, accommodations to certain groups — is seen as a threat to the unity of the nation.”

So why is the threat of a creeping Anglo-Saxon model being brandished in France today? Mr. Chabal said it was a political response based on a “double lie,” one that is a misreading of life on the ground in Britain and the United States, as well as a denial of reality in France.

In fact, he said, the differences between the two approaches are narrowing. In France, despite their allegiance to republican values, local politicians are compelled to deal with competing concerns of diverse communities. “It is the reality of a pluralistic society,” Mr. Chabal said. “Pressure groups are part and parcel of modern democracy.”",False,1653335691.0,t3_uvrr6u,t1_i9pkfau,,6,2,0,2,0,0,
