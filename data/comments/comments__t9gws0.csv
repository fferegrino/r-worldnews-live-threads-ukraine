“Her mother was killed. We don’t know how long the girl was fighting for her life. We can’t imagine how much suffering she had to bear. In the last minutes of her life she was alone, weak, frightened, thirsty.”

The mayor says the story of the girl, also mentioned earlier today by President Volodymyr Zelensky in his address, was “one of many tragic stories of Mariupol, the city surviving in a blockade for the past eight days”.

Boychenko said: “Russian invaders have cynically left the city of half a million without water, light, heat and communications. All routes into the city are blocked. All efforts to deliver food and medicine to the residents of the city were blocked by the Russian army.”

He called on the West to do more to help Ukraine, including introducing a no-fly zone.

Boychenko added: “It will not bring back our Tanya, but will save the lives of thousands of other children in Ukraine.”

""The War started and We didn't want it. We didn't want to loose what's ours. The same way you didn't want to lose your country when the Nazis attacked.

At X o'clock, we were attacked by missiles and since then, we have not been sleeping. We have been fighting. On day 2, we have been fighting air strikes and our military men on the island have been trying to fight off Russians. When the Russian forces demanded they take down our arms, they continued fighting - they opposed until the end.

We have taken people captive. We have not been torturing them. We remained humane, even under this terror against us, against children, against cities. Constant shelling has been taken place, and that didn't break us.On Day 6, the Russian rockets fell on X - that's where the Nazis killed Ukrainian people during WWII. On day 8, we saw the Russians hit the Ukrainian power stations.

On day 9, NATO came together without the results we were looking for. The alliances don't work properly always. On day 10, the Ukrainians started protesting en masse, stopping the tanks. On day 11, the cities and hospitals were being hit with constant shelling. We became heroes - constant shelling, hits.

10,000 people killed - including the General. That gave us hope that there will be some kind of responsibility for these people, including before the Court.

A child was killed. They do not allow any food or water - they can't leave. Over 50 children have been killed. These are the children that could have lived but these people have taken them from us.

We have not been looking to start this war. We have not been looking to become ""big"". but we became big over the course of this war. Fighting one of the biggest countries of this world. We have to w

The question is now ""To be or not to be"". This is Shakespeare. the question is definitely ""yes, to be."" **We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight to the end, in the sea, in the air, we will fight in the forest, we will fight in the shores, we will fight in the streets.**

***Note: this is paraphrased from  Churchill's ""We shall fight on the beaches."" - Zelensky is paraphrasing one of the UK's most famous speeches.***

**Please increase your sanctions and please make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe, and that needs to be done what needs to be done - stipulated by the Greatness of your country.**

\---**Whoever wrote this speech is clever:**

This is Churchill's speech - [https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches/](https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches/)

*e shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, w****e shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender,***

Zelensky just paraphrased him, invoked the airraids of Nazis on London, and then reminded the UK of their role in the War II, and then pointed out "" stipulated by the Greatness of your country.""  


**Also the structure is just magnificient:**

Zelensky started the speech by indirectly referring to the air raids on London, which took place during the night - ""we were awoken"" etc. He's first building a relationship - ""You were once attacked too, by raids  - you had to shelter too.""  
  
He used the ""men on the island"" to further strengthen this parallel. The UK is an island. Even if used in another context, this will just further underline the relationship between UK-Ukraine-air raids.  
  
He then used Churchill to further underline this - and then basically clarified his demands in the same sentence as ""stipulated by the Greatness of your country"". Basically saying ""You say you are great - here's what you need to do to be great - sanctions & closed sky"". While it doesn't work like this, if you have been trained in dissecting speeches, it's the impact that counts.

Another big piece of news is [MSCI reclassifying the Russian Indexes from emerging markets to standalone.](https://www.msci.com/eqb/pressreleases/archive/PR_Russia_Classification.pdf) Standalone is the lowest tier market classification MSCI uses. In fact, Russia skipped right over frontier markets classification all the way to the bottom. Both the emerging markets and frontier markets have their own composite indices, standalone does not. You can see the MSCI classification breakdown [here.](https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/market-classification.)

I’ll be honest, I am not an analyst and I no longer work in this area for a living. But my take is that there will be no reversing course here. These actions are unprecedented. Yes, sanctions take time. Yes, people are saying they are not working fast enough. But these sanctions are SEVERE. One of Russia's biggest bargaining chips is, of course, its oil. Well you now have nations that are committed to weaning themselves off of the Russian oil machine (and nat gas) in the coming decades in favor of new methods of energy generation. I personally think that this sparks a rapid growth in new energy technology. The technologies already exist and are ready for prime time, but we all know that we as a species don’t seem to move until we are forced to. Welp, we’re about to be forced to. 

Finally, [Russia recently threatened to cut off the natural gas supply that runs through Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/russia-threatens-to-cut-gas-flows-to-europe-via-nord-stream-1.)  There is no denying that this will have a negative impact on the global economy, most specifically those that are most reliant on the supply, but you know who it will absolutely devastate? The country that is currently in the midst of one of the worst economic collapses of all time. 

We might all economically feel the squeeze for a while on this, but developed nations will be able to weather the storm. The West will be ok. Russia, will not. 

Or maybe I am completely wrong, because the only thing that I have found to be true when studying events like this and trying to predict the future, especially in regards to finance and economics, it's that no one ever has any fucking clue what is going to happen.

Russian plan was to strike key targets on day one

Occupy major cities on day 2

Root out final pockets of resistance and pressure a surrender using heavy armaments in the following week.

Day 1, is self explanatory.  Russia declared their “special military operation” and began striking key targets.

Day 2 is when things began falling apart.  Russian forces attempted to infiltrate Kyiv and failed.  Russian advances into Kyiv were limited and unsuccessful.  The convoy was not meant to be the killing blow.  The convoy was meant to move into a city largely under Russian control and resupply Russian forces occupying the city.  This explains why the convey mysteriously stopped moving.  Yes, logistical issues have slowed them down but I’m going to pose the primary reason is they just simply weren’t equipped to storm a city full of defenders, and they lost the initiative.

In the days after the failed assault on Kyiv we saw several reports of very large explosions - likely thermobaric weapons.  These weapons were meant to mop up pockets of resistance and strike fear into remaining Ukrainian holdouts.  This was clearly not the case.

Now we have a Russian army that seems to be idling in Ukraine.  They have completely lost the initiative and their plan has unraveled.",False,1646756398.0,t3_t9gws0,t3_t9gws0,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Also, the US government cannot simply snap its fingers and produce more oil. The oil industry isn't nationalized. It is made up of private entities.

Why aren't these private entities increasing oil production further?

Keep in mind:

-	There are over 9,000 unused leases in the fossil fuel industry.
-	Oil companies have reported record breaking profits as of this year. They aren't short on money.
-	Fossil fuel companies benefit more from high prices. They have a vested interest in keeping prices high and slowing production and supply.

So what's the solution? Some have proposed incentivizing fossil fuels further to increase demand. This is a horrible idea, and anti-free market.

Fossil fuel companies already receive tens of billions of subsidies from the federal government every year. Between the subsidies and record-breaking profits, fossil fuel lobbyists are misleading in blaming the Biden administration for the increase in gas prices and for slowing oil production.

The ideal solution would be to nationalize the fossil fuel industry in the short term to better control prices. More importantly, we need to invest in renewable energy sources and nuclear.

I can't help but chuckle a little, I mean, what is the gas price on average over there? $4,- a gallon? I wish we had those prices here.

The average price here on gas (we do per liter, but I am converting to gallon here) in the Netherlands is about $9.90 since today.

Yeah, get on our level.

edit: I think some people in the comments have a picture of public transporation in the Netherlands solely based on the Randstad area (Amsterdam, Rotterdam,  Den haag etc.). Yes, it's quite excellent and makes a lot of sense for primary use there. But the flipaside is, if you live and work anywhere else (the north, the east or the south) it doesn't stack up so well. Public transporation is also expensive as hell and the connections aren't as good, so that driving a car is still the dominant way to travel each day in the Netherlands.

* Strips of gorilla tape/gaffers tape

Book recommendations:

The Books of Jacob, translated into English this year, by the Polish nobel prize winner Olga Tokarczuk. This is a big beefy book about big beefy things like the enlightenment and charismatic religious movements in the Pale of Settlement, a.k.a Ukraine and Belarus, the area of the Russian Empire that Jews were allowed to live in. Not for everyone, perhaps not even for most people, but it's a smart book in an engaging modern style and classic trappings.

The Master & Margarita, by the Ukrainian-Russian Mikhail Bulgakov: Black comedy, The Devil himself comes to the Stalin-era USSR. Banned by the Soviet authorities for many years because of how transgressive it was.

The World of Yesterday by Stefan Zweig, non-fiction. Zweig is a public intellectual and a popular author of early modernist Vienna who writes terse, accessible little thrillers; in the 40s from exile in Brazil he looks back over his life as a European Jew, reconstructs his relationships with people like Freud and Richard Strauss and his peak as the most popular author of interwar Europe. A lot of it (This is why I recommend it) is devoted to this feeling that the world has been broken, that horrors from the past have been unleashed, and that the tolerant, liberal order, the order that considered itself too civilized for war, has been sleepwalking all the while into the disasters of both world wars.

If you have to read one, I recommend the Zweig because it is the authentic voice of an incredibly smart, thoroughly decent human being who has watched the safety of his childhood disintegrate into tragedy. Even if it doesn't - we hope - end up being relevant to our times, there's a lot to take away from it, particularly that peace and progress can never be taken for granted. 

History books:

The Emergence of Rus 750-1200: a massive eight-volume work about the ethnogenesis of the East Slavic peoples (Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, etc) 

Red Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine: A tome about the Holodomor.

Sale of the Century: An account of Russia's botched transition to capitalism during the Yeltsin administration, featuring interviews with many leading protagonists of the great shock therapy disaster. Written by the-then Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times Chrystia Freeland, who is now the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada and the single most powerful figure in Justin Trudeau's government.

So the number of Ukranian's who is militarily ready is around 750k (that's the number I've been hearing)  
Assuming the 3:1 supply to solider ratio, we take that as 180k active combatants deployed for Ukraine. 180k + 40k foreign legionnaire = 220k  


Russia has deployed 195k into Ukraine (all 100% deployed confirmed by US DoD) active in Ukraine. Asusming they have supply and logitstics fail but still trying to somehow reinforce. Let' assume they have a 2:1 ratio going. That's 100k active combatants on Russia.  


So 220k active vs 100k for Russia.  
That's 330k active combatants approximately in Ukraine right now.  
And yet we have small incuring losses here and there. Is this attributed to the modern warfare and Russia avoiding any type of large scale battlefields since Russia's means of war is arpet bombing followed by clean up?

Article one: https://www.marca.com/en/football/2022/03/02/621f4a92e2704eb7638b45a5.html

Rinat Akhmetov (Ukraine’s richest man, Shakhtar Donetsk owner, and good buddy of Paul Manafort) has always had close ties to Russia with his businesses and politics, however it seems since 2014 the relationship has become murky. Denying claims that he helped finance separatists, while setting up multiple humanitarian efforts. Recently he’s been reported to have visited Mariupol to show support for employees of his steel / mining operation Metinvest. Stating that he plans to give them a significant raise and invest in the education of the area while helping the Ukrainian government with over 1 Billion Euros in up front taxes. 

I can’t help but feel this is mostly financially motivated with little change in politics, someone with better understanding than me may want to chime in. 

In stark contrast to the words of Rinat, former president (and oligarch himself) Petro Poroshenko, has been spotted on the streets of Kyiv sporting an AK.

Would you Rather  


Deploy Nato troops next door to Russia in NATO Estonia, requiring Russia to respond by stationing troops in Russia nearby.  Thus depriving those Russian troops from going to Ukraine  


Or deploy those Nato troops into Ukraine freeing up/justifying to Russia to deploy even more troops to Ukraine?

A heat pump is basically an AC in reverse.   

When you increase the pressure in a gas with a pump (compressor), that volume of gas has more energy (heat) per volume.   This also tells us that you can pressurize a gas to the point where (iln a container) it is hotter than the surrounding area.  Therefore warming it up.

We can observe this by emptying a can of compressed air.  As the can empties, the can gets colder.  The opposite happens when they are filled.

You do this past the point where the gas is at a higher temperature and heats up the surrounding environment.  

Then the gas is moved outside or under ground where it is allowed to  expand (within the pipes) and  and is warmed to the ground/air temperature.

This may seem odd since it's cold outside too, but remember that 0C or 32F is really 273 Kelvin (K) (where 0 K means the substance has no thermal energy).  Even frigid (to humans) air has thermal energy.  If it didn't it would become solid.

So basically a heat pump takes a gas and squeezes it till its temperature is much higher than the inside house air (warming it) then pumps this compressed near house temperature gas and let's it expand and cool to below the air/ground temperature.  Allowing the outside air/ground to warm up this gas.

A good analogy is a sponge.   The sponge is the gas in the heat pump that transports heat.  The heat is the water absorbed by the sponge.  Soak the sponge outside, squeeze it inside, take the now dry(ish) sponge outside and soak it again.",False,1646759931.0,t3_t9gws0,t1_hzuqric,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

While they are overall more efficient that burning gas, they still require electricity to operate, and that electricity is still generated mostly by fossil fuels at the moment. Also, residential heat pumps quickly lose efficiency when the temperatures drop below 10-15 deg F. which will be problematic in places with cold winters, like northern Europe. Finally, approximately half of all European natural gas consumption is related to industrial activity, which cannot be replaced simply with heat pumps. Europe really needs to move away from their dependence on fossil fuels, and although it may be a bitter pill to swallow, the best option for energy generation (until renewables become more cost-effective), is nuclear.

First, not all oil is the same. There are four different types of crude (actually about 160 when you get into sub-groups), and those types are used to make different types and qualities of distillates. For example, light oil can be used for transportation fuels (e.g. petrol) but not much else; heavy crude can be used for many transportation fuels, but also plastics and composites.

Second, not only do these fuels have different uses, but also they have different prices. So if you reroute one type of oil for a different type of production, that can have tremendous spillover effects for consumers. Hard to be ""energy independent"" if, for example, it means the cost of gasoline goes to $6/gallon or you can't pave streets because asphalt isn't available.

Third, there are different types of refineries with different processes to conform to the market needs and regulations of the target market. They also have to be configured in such a way as to process the type of crude they are receiving. Refineries aren't a simple plug-and-play for different types of oil and different markets.

Fourth, transportation and logistics is tremendously complicated. We export oil from specific sites to specific destinations because of the cost of transport. This was the entire purpose of the Keystone Pipeline -- it was designed to move crude from Canada down to the Gulf Coast refineries (with some stops along the way) -- but those refineries were then going to export the products to Europe and Latin America.

All that is to say:  you can't simply look at what your domestic production and refining resources are.  It's a global commodity because of the enormous complexity of the system.",False,1646753886.0,t3_t9gws0,t1_hzuh1ng,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Think about an analogy, that being two employers competing for your labor. If you're a maximally-employed plumber and you charge your client $70/hour, what happens if another client comes along as says ""we really need a plumber right now, so we'll pay you $90/hour""?

The first client has to be willing to pay the second client's rate, else the first client will lose the plumber's services.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Depends on your definition of ""quickly"", but for starters the various radioactive elements in the warheads have half-lives (time which it takes for the radioactivity to be cut in half) which means that some of them won't last terribly long in usable state because nuclear warheads ultimately are rather finicky to blow up properly, furthermore radiation damages other materials over time, the radioactive materials themselves deteriorate physically, the rockets used to launch the warheads need maintenance as they aren't exactly simple, the launch facilities need maintenance, etc.

>In recent years, Putin also has made inroads with some leaders of the American Christian right, who viewed Russia as a country that led on moral issues while, in their view, the US fell into moral decay.

>“Russian leadership post-communism was embracing this idea of Russia as a Christian nation,” Posner told Al Jazeera. Autocrats like Putin, she said, “are seen as model leaders now that America has become too liberal. Over time you start to see that trickle down to the base.”

>In 2013, for example, Russia enacted an anti-LGBTQ law that banned “propaganda” that promoted “nontraditional” relationships for children. Franklin Graham, the son of the late Reverend Billy Graham, praised Putin for the law restricting speech around LGBTQ issues, arguing that it gave Russia the high ground above the US, which had “abdicated our moral leadership”.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Article 1

The Purposes of the United Nations are:

1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;
2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
3. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and
4. To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.

Or it is cheaper to buy from Saudi/Russia/whatever than to pump/rail/ship from North Dakota to Corpus Christi, or we're using more to make certain plastics than jet fuel and require more of a type of crude that comes from a foreign source. It is wildly complex.

Edit to add that there are literally thousands of players in the game. It is not remotely as simple as US import, US export, etc. You've got tens of thousands of small drillers, pumpers, and other upstream players getting the oil, several huge midstream companies pumping the oil around the country and storing it, and a few hundred companies refining it to finished product/raw product for other industries, then a bunch of wholesalers moving those products to various other markets/industries.

I’m not expert myself, but the simplest answer I can give is that just because we CAN get all of our oil and gas domestically, doesn’t mean that it’s the CHEAPEST way to do so. Remember, profits drive everything. If some refineries on the west coast find it cheaper to import oil from Russia than from US-based production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, they are absolutely going to do that. All other things being equal, any company is going to source their supply from the cheapest source possible, foreign or domestic. 

So what happens when you do cut off a foreign supplier like Russia? Even if the US does have enough oil to make up for it, prices still go up, because now companies are forced to source their supply from a more expensive option. And naturally that higher price is always going to get passed on to the consumer, because that’s just how capitalism works.

Ultimately, consumers of oil and gas have to accept that if they support Ukraine, this is part of the price they pay. For my part at least, I am more than happy to do so if it means we’re inflicting maximum pain on Russia.",False,1646749693.0,t3_t9gws0,t1_hzu7lun,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

What was unknown to the French was that the majority of German Armor was concentrated there, so when they broke through the forest they easily overwhelmed the defense there, and encircled the allied forces fighting in Belgium. Additionally the Germans launched a massive bombing campaign (the largest ever at that time) that broke French Artillery divisions allowing infantry support to more easily advance and solidify the breakthroughs.. The encirclement of the Belgian front led to the loss of the best French divisions, and the retreat of BEF, and forced the surrender.

Yakovlev Fighter

I'm Yakovlev fighter, my engine sings steel,
Skies are my soul and fiber,
But he, who's sitting behind the wheel,
He thinks of himself as a fighter.
 
Junkers went down in this last ordeal -
I struck him with brutal force.
But he, who's sitting behind the wheel,
Already gives me remorse.
 
In my recent fight I was hit a great deal,
Mechanics did overhauling,
But he, who's sitting behind the wheel,
Again is forcing me stalling.
 
A bomber plane carries a bomb that will bring
Death to our headquarters.
And a stabilizer is singing, it seems:
“Peace to your sons and daughters!”3
 
A Messerschmitt plane quickly gets on my heels.
I’m wounded and tired of war.
But he, who's sitting behind the wheel,
I see, he is going head-on!
 
And what is he doing? Incoming! A blast!
But I will not burn in the rye!
Velocity limits all broken at last,
I exit the treacherous dive.
 
I’m leading, behind me… I better lose wings!
Just where is he, my wingman?
Well, now he’s on fire, but he nosedives and sings:
“Peace for all your children!”
 
The one, who's now occupying my skull,
Is left by himself, a fool.
He got me confused and he forced me to dive
Right from the Nésterov's loop.
 
He switched to full throttle, he's increasing wing loads,
Well, hardly a fighter ace.
Again, I would have to conform, I suppose,
But this time is very last.
 
I won’t be submissive! I swear by these skies!
It's better to lie on the ground.
Now what? Is he deaf? Can't he hear my fast pulse?
My gasoline blood... it runs out!
 
The patience threshold of the vehicle was reached:
The time of this pilot has passed.
The one, who was sitting behind the wheel,
Has burred his face in the glass.
 
He's killed! With an ease now I'm flying alive,
I'm burning my last reserves.
What's this? I'm maintaining a vertical dive…
Can't level the flight by myself!
 
It's pretty annoying that I've little achieved,
But let Lady Luck gift others.

Watching these events, I'm reminded of the Winter War in 1939-40. 

Finland only gained its independence in the aftermath of the collapse of the Russian Empire. Despite its newfound independence, Soviet leaders remained wary of the proximity of Finland to the Russian heartland and specifically to Leningrad, which was only 50km from the border. 

The Soviets were worried that Finland might align itself with Germany and entered into negotiations with the Finns while building up forces on the border. Soviet emissaries told the Finns that the Soviets did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather ""advance to meet the enemy"". Finnish representatives assured them that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. The Soviets suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, but Finland refused. Negotiations continued with no progress, Finland sought military guarantees with Sweden to no avail. 

Finally, in November of '39, the Soviets staged a false flag attack on their forces and invaded. Most observers expected a quick, knock out blow and Soviet plans called for a 3-week war. 

To everyone's shock, the Finns resisted with heroic stubbornness. Their troops were well prepared for winter warfare and used innovative tactics like ski troops, Molotov cocktails, and falling back to prepared defensive positions. The Russian Army was poorly led and didn't use proper combined arms techniques. They were unprepared for the winter conditions. The Finns fought the Soviets to a standstill in the first month and an uneasy lull occurred. During the lull, the Red Army reorganized, reequipped, and reassembled. When the Russians came back for more, they were much more effective. The Finns fought bravely, begged for foreign intervention (which fell on deaf ears, despite decent numbers of foreign volunteers), and were able to prevent Helsinki from falling but ultimately were forced to the negotiating table and had to make significant territorial concessions to secure peace.

I’m not saying it’s not awful or horrible. Now saying I don’t feel awful about. I really empathize and sympathize. Yesterday I saw a video of a Ukrainian toddler dying thanks to Russia. 

I’m a mother, my son is 11, so I truly imagine the pain and understand the pain of losing you child. 

Russia has the world between a rock and a hard place. We could do a no fly zone and enforce it. But all that will do, is make the war 100 times worse. 

More innocent people will die as it will become a war with USA, EU, NATO vs Russia. 

Not only that but Putin has nuclear weapons and he would probably use them. So it goes from hundreds of people dying in Ukraine to millions dying all over the world. 

We aren’t heartless. We want to help. We are trying to do everything we can to help without triggering Putin to push that nuclear button. 

Thousands of volunteers from the USA and Europe are coming/there to sign up with the Ukrainian Legion. I saw a video of a doctor trying to figure out how to get there to help at the hospitals and frontlines as a medic. We are supplying you with as many weapons we can, providing intel, etc. 

Personally, just my opinion, if Ukraine can hold out, I think Russia will just collapse. Their economy tanked thanks to sanctions, their soldiers are dying at a higher rate than Ukrainian soldiers, they are loosing more equipment, soldiers sabotaging that equipment, soldiers abandoning their post, etc. Putin is loosing everything. His little buddies are loosing everything. Putin will loose, and the world is trying to ensure he does without triggering a world war. 

It’s not fair I know. It’s not right. It’s maddening we can’t help. It’s tragic how Putin has decided to go with war crimes and attack and kill civilians, hitting schools, hospitals, neighborhoods.

He all but said so and both Bolton and I think Barr (or McMaster not sure EDIT: IT was Kelly) confirmed that they only barely managed to talk him into delaying it till his second term.

The delusions of people about Trump are staggering. He really is like Putin in a way. Just not as smart. But his fans are as blind.

Trump never distanced himself really from Putin. He even called him a genius last week and I vividly remember the beyond awkward Helsinki meeting.

Paul Manafort was the right hand man of Yanukovich (aka the puppet Putin wants to re-install in Ukraine if possible) before he became campaign manager of Trump.

Trump pulled out of the WHO and levied tariffs on his NATO allies while doing his best to ease the sanctions on Russia.

You have to be really blind to not realize that Trump did everything in his power to weaken NATO (Macron called it braindead when Trump was in office for a reason) and to weaken the West which is exactly what Putin wanted.

And why on earth do people in the US always act like Trump is playing some 4 D chess and you are allowed to always spin his words in a way that makes them defensible?

The point of my original statement is it's absurd to tell Americans not to complain about the prices of gas bc it's more expensive where you are. Most areas here rely on personal vehicles for transportation, public transportation is crap, our federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, our healthcare is tied to our jobs and can bankrupt us even WITH insurance, and many of us cannot afford the gas to get to work so we can get paid slave wages.

Ever seen the movie ""The Final Countdown""? Where a 1980s US carrier ends up time-warped back to WW2? Imagine for a moment if they'd stayed. None of the pilots outside those on the carrier would know how to fly the jets, let alone use the fancy-schmancy radar or other sensors. None of the WW2-era munitions would fit on the F-14s/F-18s from the carrier. Hell the available fuel might not be high-enough purity/octane. The comms gear on those jets is encrypted, but there's no compatible comms gear in the WW2 US arsenal. Ammo factories could probably make cannon ammo relatively quickly, but the tech base just didn't exist to make guided missiles, so what's on the carrier would be all they would have - when they're gone, *they're gone*. F-14s in particular had a lot of mechanical complexity with the sweep-wings, if those broke, unless the guys on the carrier had spares or the ability to machine up replacement parts, that's a lot of useless planes on/below deck very quickly.
