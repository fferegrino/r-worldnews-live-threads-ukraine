In what could be considered the worst decision in the history, Russia has decided to attack Russia ... in the winter.

They lead an offensive war in unknown territory against a morally-surperior force.

The Ukrainians, having for a long time been part of the Soviel Union, know Russia's tricks. They may be the only country Russia could face that *knows* how Russia operates, how dirty it plays. They know what to do, how to engage that enemy.

They know that the Russians wouldn't escort their troop bearing planes.

They know that the Russians, in an offensive position, rely on constant logistic support. You cut them off, Russian soldiers are stranded without food, water, fuel and ammunition, while the Ukrainians fight in their own country. They don't need logistic convoys, they've got all they need where they need it.

Russia is taking heavy, heavy casualties, much more than anticipated.

The news will reach their home. Mothers and fathers will learn of their dead children and blame Putin for it.

There was a meeting last night. Putin is in the Urals. Businessmen are summoned specifically for meetings, so that no one leaves in a panic.  
They are not allowed out of airports on private flights.  
All the fortifications from the Ukrainian side were found in advance and gunned down. There was no tactical plan. I quote: ""we had everything as we went along."" [-they were making decisions in the process, no particular plans] They hoped to take everything in 1-4 days.  
Discussing financial losses.  
The war is costing $20 billion a day.  
Putin was fierce. Was sure it would be an easy walk.  
Not enough missiles. Enough for three or four days. They are being saved.  
Weapons are not enough already. The Tula factory and the other 2 Rotenberg factories can't fulfill orders for weapons. Rifles and bullets. Physically. Weapons are in short supply. The next guns are realistic to get in 3-4 months.  
No raw materials. Might take even more time.
There used to be supplies from Slovenia, Finland and Germany. They are blocked now.  
They discussed that if Ukraine stands for 10 days, they will have to sit down on the negotiating table. Because there is not enough money, weapons or resources. They are not particularly afraid of sanctions.  
Alpha, the special operations forces have been somewhere near Kiev since the 18th.  
They are counting on the fact that the advanced units will take Kiev and put their protege. And they won't have to spend any money, military or weapons.  
They're preparing a provocation against civilians. Attacking children, women. To sow panic.  
That's their trump card.  
The whole plan is to hope for panic. And that they will surrender themselves or Zelensky will run away.  
They're counting on Kharkov to surrender first. And the other cities will follow suit, to avoid bloodshed.  
Russia has problems with airports. There are no drones. Very saddened by the loss of a convoy near Kharkov, where 200 people were killed. Losses on the Russian side are serious.  
Quote: met fierce resistance from the enemy.  
They are in shock.  
The task: to hold out for 9 more days. To prevent panic. Explain about the missiles, that it's all for intimidation. They deliberately hit wherever and wherever they can, and ""accidentally"" hit residential buildings.

Judging from all that happened the last few days, and seeing some analyses . It seems to me that Putin is best in a covert sneaky from the top kind of way, very incident driven. Dirty politics. But a military invasion is definitely not his forte. It seems to me he has the same flaw as Hitler eventually had in WW2, not letting his generals do the strategic planning but himself doing it. At least, that's my general impression thus far. I am by no means a strategic mastermind, I am just comparing strategy in history. But certain aspects seem very reckless.

The bad news is, if Putin realises he is getting nowhere, it could get very nasty and even more reckless (bombing etc.).",1645878498.0,1645878023.0,t3_t1ucik,t3_t1ucik,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Snopes says the info is of mixed veracity but more importantly, has verification links: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/why-does-ukraine-matter

Anyway, it‚Äôs interesting to see how resource rich Ukraine is. So maybe, this isn‚Äôt just about Pooter‚Äôs oversized ego; it might also be pure greed? 

THIS IS WHY PUTIN WANTS UKRAINE:

*Ukraine ranks:*

Use their [request system](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to report the subreddit based on hate speech.

Here's a template I wrote (remember to replace the posts with more current ones if they have changed):  
""Hello,  
If you currently visit the subreddit r/russia, you will see that it currently contains the following posts, among *many others*, on its front page:  
-https://old.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t1nmjy/ -> History Repeats Itself  
-https://reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t1syh9/ -> Ukrainian Military pretended to wipe Russian Military as many as twice of its real size, since 2014. Now we all see what is like to actually fight Russian Military, eh?  
-https://reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t1qi3e/ -> NEVER FORGET NEVER AGAIN! This Is What Russia Is Fighting Against!

Each and everyone of those posts is based on the very basic wrong narrative that the war in Ukraine is justified, and that the Russians are undoubtedly going to win. This is a factually wrong narrative, this is a morally wrong narrative. It is an abhorrent narrative, and it is a narrative that is currently used to justify terrifying human atrocities in the East of Europe. Never mind the fact that these posts are obvious DISinformation (not just misinformation) - they are lies, they are based on false elements, and fake news, and they undermine our global stability.

Now, I don't know why this has been allowed up until now. Putin's war is based on one thing, and one thing only: the idea that an imperialist, fascist nation with nukes has a natural right to a ""lebensraum"" within a lesser nation's territory. Given the generalizations, lies, and hatred spread by the Russian thug in charge of the band of war criminals they call the ""Russian army"", it can only really be defined as an ethnic and cultural rejection of Ukraine and its people.

Here you give us report options against hate speech. Speech that promotes violence and hatred against identity and vulnerability. If you listen to the Russian rationale for launching the invasion, and examine its actions, you can see that you are:

-Allowing a number of posts that support the idea that the Ukrainian people are lesser than the Russian people, and deserve violence or hatred;  
-Promoting the war rhetoric of an entirely unjustified conflict in Europe, done by an unprovoked aggressor, a war rhetoric whose entire aim is to destabilize and delegitimize the essential rights of Ukrainian people;  
-Aiding and abetting a fascist state that is currently committing egregious human rights abuses, war crimes, and international aggressions, in another sovereign nation, by leaving an outlet for its propagandists and communicators to spread false information and damaging intel.

I urge you today, Reddit, to take down this violent, this hateful, this false content, that promotes nothing but hatred against a nation, and which is used to justify inhumane war crimes.

All of this, of course, ignores the fact that if you actively aid and abet the Russian fascists, you will not be safe in the US for very long. You are promoting westward expansionism by an unstable nuclear nation that has shown it is willing to use violence, including threats of nuclear annihilation, to achieve its goals.

Choose your side, Reddit.""",1645877857.0,1645877752.0,t3_t1ucik,t3_t1ucik,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

Opinions of MAD tend to vastly overestimate how destructive it would be. This is not to say it wouldn't be bad, but very unlikely to be as bad as you're assuming. If every possible nuke launched successfully their blast radius would only be about 100,000 Sq miles. 1/4 the size of the US, or a tiny fraction of the world's land. That's absolute worst case scenario. More likely only a fraction of the nukes would actually launch and successfully detonate, and their targets would largely be military outposts. Most would also be aimed at one of two countries, Russia or the US. Many would refuse to launch their nukes, especially after dozens or hundreds have already been launched. More would fail to explode (surprisingly common for nukes). More would be shot out of the sky or not readied in time to launch (most nukes are kept in storage). 

Nukes explode high up in the air, so they don't kick up much dust. The ideas of a nuclear winter have been strongly challenged. Between all that, you're much more likely to survive the initial blasts than die in it. Your chances might be lower if you're in downtown Manhattan for example, but in rural Kentucky or a medium-sized town in France? Very good chance you live.

 Then you've just gotta wait out the fallout and possible nuclear winter. Challenging, but do-able. I keep a years stockpile of food on me. Rice, beans, flour, dried vegetables, vegetable oil, canned vegetables/fruit, some vitamins, etc. My entire stockpile is in the $150 range. It's not good eating, or particularly healthy, but it'll keep me alive.

So in the unlikely case nukes do drop, you've still got a good chance of making it out alive.",1645873473.0,1645873207.0,t3_t1ucik,t3_t1ucik,,0,-7,0,-7,0,0,

French officials told the BBC that the ship was intercepted in line with new EU sanctions and say it has been redirected to the northern port of Boulogne-Sur-Mer.

""It has been taken to the French port after a request by the French government because it is suspected of belonging to a company targeted by EU sanctions against Moscow.

I turned your comment into a letter for my representatives, in case anyone wants to copy/paste:

Dear \[Senator Name\],  
In light of the situation with Russia invading Ukraine, I‚Äôm requesting your help to ban Russian state channels from YouTube.  
YouTube bans videos of anti-vaxxers and flat-earthers (and rightfully so), but somehow still allows Russian state channels to spread their propaganda to both Russians and the international community.  
The information war is no less important than the war with weapons. It is necessary that ordinary Russians see the truth of what Putin is doing in Ukraine and start protesting. Remember, the West managed to defeat the Soviet Union without a direct military confrontation thanks to isolation and information warfare.

1. Putin leveled Grozny to the ground with artillery. He's only hit urban Kiev a few times.

Like leveling the house your shooting at me from with autocannon fire from BTR & BMPs. Also, killing the occupants in a house by shooting a Thermobaric rpg into a window.
3. Russian invasion of Crimea saw that cut phone lines, and jam all radio and cell communications. They even freaked out NATO when they rolled out they giant electronic warfare transmitter that gave them over the horizon jamming.
4. The standard of modern warfare as seen in 1999 Serbian bombing and 2003 Shock and Awe in Baghdad means you dont just bomb military targets but hit all communications, power stations, transformers, major transmission lines, blow up TV and radio towers and along with major bridges.
5. The it's too expensive to rebuild it and he wants to preserve infrastructure is not a valid excuse. The reality is he wants to pressure Zelensky into regime change and wants to win hearts and mind and severely under estimated how much popularity the man has.

I agree with many things you have said but that doesn't mean that the Russian military is necessarily overrated. Just that things haven't gone at all like they anticipated.

From what we know Putin thought this would probably be over in 24-36 hours without facing much resistance (atleast not from the general public) or without too many casualties. He thought the Ukrainians would be overwhelmed, frightened and that Zelensky would have no choice but to flee or surrender.

That was a massive miscalculation. But Russia still has advanced to Kyiv already and still has many, many more troops and very, very ugly weapons that they could use to change things.

Its just that the cost to Putin is already far higher than he expected it to be. He probably still can pretty easily win this (and most likely ultimately will) but the price he will have to pay for it will be astronomically high. He probably has to use the kind of weapons that will make for very ugly videos and pictures and isolate him in the World even further if he wants to somewhat quickly end this conflict.

But remember, Russia was economically isolated for 70 years. The state and it's people know how to deal with that, in fact it's all they know. Since the late 90's Russia has gradually returned to protectionism and statism, i.e. a Soviet style government. Not because oligarchic capitalism didn't work well for them but because they value other interests over GDP.

The strategy is that all former Soviet countries and territories that surround Russia must depend on them politically, culturally, militarily and economically. Ukraine has opposed this since 2014 which threatens Moscows plan to restore it's empire. Georgia did in 2008, too. This is the real pretext, not protecting Russian speakers that were sent to these countries as a deliberate plan of ""russification"".

Ordinary Russians have supported and carried this mentality, and to varying degrees still do. Even many who now oppose or question Putin. It is the way things have worked for centuries and if me and you would have lived there we too would know nothing else. But they are still not to blame.

But that's it's just the way it is. The sanctions will impact them just as North Koreans suffer under our sanctions. To some extent it is a hostage situation. The difference being the hostage takers have nukes and that war is an incredibly blunt and counterproductive tool anyway. So we have no choice but to use diplomacy and sanctions. And culture, too. Even though I'm scared of how social media is impacting the mental health of people and societies, I believe it changes ""hearts and minds"" among youth in isolated countries.

I hope they will ultimately agreeto it but you have to understand that nobody in the world got caught with their pants down harder over this than Germany. Many are still in denial and shock. And they probably also simply haven't done the math and made a proper decision on this.

They thought that ""Wandel durch handel"" aka diplomacy via trade can lead to peace and stability and help spread the Western values. Thats one of the reasons why they are so dependant on Russia. Since the Cold War Germany always believed it had to help balance the relationship between the Eastern World and Western World and try to keep a good relationship with everyone to be able to help diplomatically solve conflicts. One if not the key component of this was via trade.

They foolishly believed Putin to be a rational actor and that they could just keep doing what they have been doing (focussing on the economy and basically paying a ton of money (I think they have given the most financial aid to Ukraine over the last few years) to smooth over conflicts and preserve peace and stability without having to question their views.

Moves like these work when they are done quickly, quietly and as a matter of fact.

It can massively backfire when there is a long resistance. Your army is exposed and the longer fight back time means that world leaders can covertly support with aide after taking their time to deliberate their moves.

When you finish it quickly and without resistance, all you have are sanctions that are quietly forgotten as the annexation becomes normalized.

There is no coming back from this. Russian economy is in a free fall and their army has been exposed. Putin looks like an idiot and his outbursts against Finland and Sweden are very much not of the man the world feared.

12h36 - Conselheiro de Seguran√ßa da R√∫ssia amea√ßa com sa√≠da de tratados nucleares

O vice-presidente do Conselho de Seguran√ßa da R√∫ssia advertiu este s√°bado que o pa√≠s pode optar por sair do acordo nuclear e congelar os ativos ocidentais na R√∫ssia, referindo-se √†s san√ß√µes aplicadas pelo Ocidente como prova de ""impot√™ncia pol√≠tica"".

Citado pela Associated Press, Dmitry Medvedev, que √© vice-presidente do Conselho presidido por Vladimir Putin, escreveu na sua p√°gina na rede social russa VKontakte que as san√ß√µes impostas pelos Estados Unidos, Uni√£o Europeia e outros aliados podem dar a Moscovo um pretexto para uma revis√£o completa dos la√ßos com o Ocidente.

Em concreto, apontou que a R√∫ssia pode optar por sair do programa de controlo de armas nucleares New START, que limita o arsenal das duas antigas pot√™ncias da Guerra Fria.

Additionally, there were orders against Russian pilots taking part in air-to-air conflict in Vietnam at the least, and since that conflict ended no pilots have come forward claiming to have flown in sorties, and while there were some 3,000 Russians in Vietnam at the time they were not on orders, they were 'combat experts' there to train.

Criminals, Mobs etc took advantage of that time to do whatever it is they wanted and move their products around. Also there was an uptick in murders during those times as well, quite a few serial killers made their debut, lots of unsolved murders. Just a whole slew of criminal activity because everyone was busy worrying about other things.

 It was also easy for organized crime to recruit because they had access to food and shelter the average person didn't. It was pretty easy to say ""Yes"" to delivering an unmarked package or driving a truck a few towns over when they were offering you food for a week or your family a spot in a bunker during the raids.

3080d22ed3c43ef326f861c0dbf56dd1,t1ucik,hyiek3g,"Some historical pointers for you:

In a series of 2015-16 interviews to the American filmmaker Oliver Stone ‚Äì a 20-hour conversation spread across two years ‚Äì Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin recalls a time he broached the subject of Russia joining Nato with Bill Clinton. The then US President‚Äôs response, Putin recounts, was ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù But the American delegation, Putin says, got very nervous at the prospect, and the idea died right there.

Russia‚Äôs plea to join Nato is not new. Mikhail Gorbachev raised the possibility at the very outset of the Soviet Union breaking up. Commentators have discussed this as recently as a month ago to forestall the invasion of Ukraine. But the idea has had few takers in the militaristic US establishment primed by Cold War thinking.
Nato was formed, in part, to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. If the principal adversary, even in the form of a legatee state, joined the party, what would be the purpose of the alliance? The Masters of War constantly in search of defence budgets and enemies could hardly countenance it.

In fact, getting Russia into an American bear hug underpins the thinking in parts of Donald Trump‚Äôs MAGA constituency to this day ‚Äì albeit for different reasons. Trump himself sought good ties with Russia ‚Äì to the extent of inviting derision as Putin‚Äôs poodle ‚Äì believing that China is the principal adversary the US has to focus on, and the Ukraine issue should be left to Europe to sort out. Much before he praised Putin as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, ‚Äúsavvy‚Äù and ‚Äúgenius‚Äù for his Ukraine grab, he left it to his acolytes to elucidate his thinking. They have done so with gusto.
JD Vance, the author of the acclaimed Hillbilly Elegy, who is running for the US Senate from Ohio, told Trump surrogate Steve Bannon in a podcast last week that he didn‚Äôt really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another. Vance wants America to please spare him the ‚Äúperformative affection for the Ukraine‚Äù that is now in full flow and instead focus on the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of illegal immigrants on the US southern border.

#
An Iraq War veteran, he also railed against warmongers in Washington, berating one former general for drinking ‚Äúfine wine at bull**** security conferences while thousands of working-class kids died on the battlefield‚Äù and asking him how much he stood to gain financially from a war with Russia.
Lauren Witzke, a Republican operative and former Senate candidate in Joe Biden‚Äôs home state Delaware, went a little further, bringing in the religious angle by referring to Russia as a ‚ÄúChristian nationalist nation‚Äù and saying she identified more with Putin‚Äôs Christian values than she did with Biden. In the Trumpian MAGA world, a White Christian Russia would have been lockstep with America ‚Äì against China and other non-white nations.

Instead, America has driven Russia into China‚Äôs arms, into a ‚Äúfriendship with no limits‚Äù, setting the stage for a new Cold War that could last a few generations. Disdained by US militarists, Putin has pounced on Ukraine, assessing ‚Äì correctly or incorrectly we will know in time ‚Äì that the West is too enfeebled and divided to stop him. The domestic dissonance on foreign policy, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the diminution of Nato, and America‚Äôs house of cards economy, has emboldened him to take the gamble to pull off a reckless Ukraine heist.
Where does this leave India? A tight spot would be an understatement. Already, calls are being made for New Delhi to get off the fence and take a stand, if not take sides. It is a tough call. If India subscribes to the freedom of choice argument that Washington and its Nato allies are advancing for Ukraine to come out of the Russian orbit, then it risks the similar outcome in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan, in its sphere of influence. If it defends Moscow‚Äôs depredations, then it risks providing China, already nibbling away at its border, with a rationale to do the same.

Fortunately, New Delhi has a few things going for it to thwart any adventurism. Nuclear cover for one thing, something Ukrainians are wishing they had retained when the Soviet Union collapsed and they briefly found themselves the third largest nuclear power in the world, only to give it up for security warranties ‚Äì from US and Russia among others.

More than at any time, India should express gratitude for Vajpayee‚Äôs decision to go nuclear in the teeth of American and world opinion. And it also needs to thank Beijing for its predatory practices that have pauperised countries such as Sri Lanka and even Pakistan (whose natural ally really ought to be India, but that‚Äôs another story).
In contrast, American munificence is underappreciated, whether it is shipping food grains to India in the 1960s or allowing thousands of Indian students to study in the US even at the height of the Cold War.

Yes, India ‚Äì and the world ‚Äì has had its moments of malice from the US (notably in 1971). The Soviet Union and its successor state has been a good friend. But Russia‚Äôs response to being cornered by Nato has been hasty, reckless and disproportionate. It also creates a dangerous precedent for India from aggressor states. 

So it remains to be seen if India will decide to back US in future.",False,1645881357.0,t3_t1ucik,t1_hyie44k,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
