Day 398-399 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last few days were somewhat quiet, thankfully not much happened here in the city other than a brief emergency with our energy infrastructure today. The lights flickered a couple of times, there were some local outages and then hot water stopped for a bit, but everything was resolved in around 20 minutes.

Though it was definitely much less quiet in Kharkiv oblast. As usual Russians shelled a lot of towns that are close to the frontline, and they also hit Kupiansk with S-300 missiles again. For some reason yesterday they also shelled Bohodukhiv, it’s not one of their usual targets and we are not even sure what they were trying to hit there. The S-300 missiles they used landed in an empty space between private houses and a kindergarten, they managed to damaged 13 houses and injure 1 civilian.

It’s great to see that we are at least starting to hit them back now. Yesterday some of our drones hit a gas reservoir somewhere in Belgorod oblast, and today we most likely hit a substation. And it also looks like we managed to hit an airbase in Hvardiyske in Crimea today. Russians said that the drone was intercepted and fell into a field, but they didn’t post any photos of the place where it landed, which they usually do when one of our drones hits something unimportant. So, there’s actually a pretty good chance that it at least managed to get to the airbase, but we don’t know if it hit anything there.",False,1680129873.0,t3_125ciht,t3_125ciht,,0,166,0,166,0,0,

>(1/5) Fighting continues in the Donbas town of Bakhmut, though Russian assaults are still at a reduced level compared to recent weeks.

>(2/5) One of the key achievements of recent Ukrainian operations has likely been to push Russian Wagner Group fighters back from the 0506 route.

>(3/5) This minor country road has become a critical supply line for Ukrainian defenders. Wagner had previously been within a few hundred metres of the route.

>(4/5) On 26 March 2023, Russian media claimed Wagner had taken full control of the Azom factory complex to the north of Bakhmut town centre.

>(5/5) However, the area likely remains contested, as it has been for the past fortnight. With Wagner having now confirmed the release of at least 5000 prisoner fighters, personnel shortages are likely hampering Russian offensive efforts in the sector.

18f77564ecd9869810e28b55000462e1,125ciht,je5mpnq,"There's been an unusual lateral move in Putin's government today. Putin ordered [Vitaliy Khotsenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaliy_Khotsenko) off his post as the Chairman of the Government of the ""Donetsk PeOpLe's RePuBLiC"" and unexpectedly appointed him the Governor of Omsk Oblast.

It's hard to read between the lines, but Khotsenko's removal is likely a financial decision. His patron Rogozin has lost most of his influence. There's been a lot of hostile takeovers of businesses and land holdings all over Donetsk, possibly linked to Dmitry Medvedev. Khotsenko's appointment in the summer had raised a lot of eyebrows, some speculating that such a relative nobody getting such a high-visibility post was because no one else wanted the job. The fact that he left his DNR seat vacant may support that hypothesis. 

Khotsenko was born in Ukraine but grew up in Russia. He's second-generation corruption. In the 1990s his dad was a top anti-corruption cop in Siberia, using his position to become extremely rich and influential. His dad owns hotels and gas and oil wells all over Siberia as well as Stavropol Krai, a region near Ukraine and Georgia. 

Typical of Putin's state-sponsored corruption Khotsenko had all sorts of bullshit government jobs around his dad's domains. His dad Pavel became closely associated with Dmitry Rogozin of Roskosmos, and Vitalik's sudden appointment to head DNR government was likely pushed through by Rogozin. 

Vitaly was wounded in the December bombing of a Donetsk hotel where Rogozin celebrated his birthday. The bombing was reportedly blue-on-blue, ordered by Wagner's Prigozhin. Rogozin was in Donetsk trying to set up his own competing PMC.

Vitaly has not been seen much since the bombing, and Rogozin's own fortunes took a downturn.

After only nine months at the top post, Khotsenko has now replaced [Aleksandr Burkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Burkov), a corrupt dweeb who turned his 1990s criminal past into a lucrative business relationship with the leader of Russia's monarchists [Anton Bakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Bakov).

So here's a quick summary of some answers:

1. Putin will almost certainly not use nukes. It is propaganda for domestic audiences and to stoke fear among civilians. US has stated they would basically wipe out Russian forces in and around Ukraine conventionally if Russia did. Xi also told Putin not to.

2. Russia is pulling older and older equipment out of storage and giving it marginal upgrades, they can only do this once and their production of modern stuff is FAR too slow. Ukraine meanwhile keeps getting more allied kit, this will potentially increase as allied industry wakes up and funding is applied.

3. CCP is unlikely to support Russia with military supply except in plausibly deniable ways. They are as reliant on allied trade as we are of their industry. Long term, we will detach from that but that's years away. CCP is exceptionally reliant on external resources and food...

4. War isn't straight forward and all ahead 100%. It is a tug-of-war, constant push-pull. Ukraine has harsh seasons with the best times to conduct offensives during frozen or dry ground. Autumn(Fall)/Spring are big mud seasons. Watch for late Spring/Summer for next big offensives. Russia has been really stupid in this regard.

If you can think of other abbreviated points that have eluded me, please respond. If you have questions, please ask but keep in mind that so many of these questions have already been answered so that would be the main 'why' for any downvotes.

Happy to engage, hope this helps some of our newer regulars.

Edit: Sometimes I do some wider analysis pieces, I may do so in the lead-up to June, if we get OSINT I can work with or some indicators. Keep an eye out for it, I've been mostly on point and it has been well received in the past (Although haven't done much in a while).

Edit2: For full disclosure, the main prediction I got wrong was Ukraine's possible winter offensive. It was likely canned due to increased Russian actions and a wish to conserve and train up on new allied kit for an offensive later. Hindsight is 20-20, always keep in mind we have limited OSINT and battlefield conditions change, thus decisions change with them. Ukraine's decision I would argue, was the correct one.",1680078536.0,1680075492.0,t3_125ciht,t3_125ciht,,0,94,0,94,0,0,

I know the whole point of spending billions on the latest weaponry is to avoid a long grinding attritional war, but I don't think you can attack a peer or near-peer state one on one, and not have it devolve into that.

A lot of NATO prioritizes air-superiority at the cost of artillery, and seeing Russia's air fleet largely relegated to stand off guided munitions or air support in favorable parts of the front where AA is less of issue seems telling. A small outdated fleet of jets and a high density of MANPADS and small-medium range AA systems have largely disabled Russia's airforce as a strategic or operational threat. They do however remain a regional and tactical asset.

When a conflict devolves into an attritional war, it seems like the most cost effective solutions like artillery, AT systems and mines, drones with grenades, etc... End up being the basic and most effective systems to get results. Especially when paired with real time data on enemy positions and movements.

I have been thinking about this a little over the past year. Poland used to be the most tolerant country in Europe (say a few hundred years back, sort of Sobiesky times) that's where all the bagels and other ""jewish deli"" foods came from.

Then a few centuries of issues from outsiders caused this tolerance to sort of die down a bit, but mostly because the outsiders were killing the diversity of Polish culture. That's why bagels are now in NY and not in Poland. The bakers didn't want the nazis to kill them and ran away.

Now we have a crap ton of Ukrainians, before the war I think about 3% of the population and I think now 10 - 15% and about 10% of businesses in Poland are now Ukrainian owned. They can't vote yet. But I believe in about 3-5 years they probably can.

And the Ukrainians tend to be younger and female. I have read studies showing wives influence husbands voting patterns more than the husbands will admit, especially in conservative groups.

I see a wickedly bad future for PiS in this. Which is good, I think a lot of of Poles still have the pride of the cool arse times of their history and I can see this bringing it back.

\-> Scheduled ammo transports and train schedules (the trains even had to wait on the bridge everytime they crossed it) easily available for Ukrainian intelligence

It also make it more likely for their other long range weapons, like the UAVs used to hit Leningrad Air Base, to actually reach the intended target.

Russia will not use nukes unless it's an existential threat to their country/gov existence, this is written in law. This isn't going to happen except through their own ineptitude.

Only marginally potential use would be tac nukes to stop an advance, Crimea maybe... BUT

What does it achieve, what are the costs? It wouldn't even necessarily stop an advance, just slow it down.

Russia loses anything left of their influence over non-aligned nations and will basically guarantee US targeting of their military.

The US, without nukes is powerful enough to cripple Russian forces from a distance. They have basically said they would if Russia goes down this path. And that's not even considering the relative strike power of the rest of the Allies.

Putins number 1 priority, above all the bs is to stay in power. Using a nuke would precipitate a much higher likelihood of a coup due to the Allied response.

Xi said to Putin 'don't use nukes'. Xi is Putins one remaining powerful 'partner'.

All the nuke talk is fearmongering and designed to get the sort of response you have. It's just propaganda for domestic purposes and to stoke fears among allied civilians.

Thus the downvotes, this has been debunked time and again.

Remember, rule 1. Russia lies.

Remember, classic disinformation often relies on a false dichotomy, basically you are provided with a one or the other choice when there are so many other options.

Geopolitics and military responses are not Binary, they have many layers and levels of responses. The allies have got this one snuffed out, we are plenty scary without nukes, and those that have them only use them as a deterrence, as does basically every country with them.

And while I'm at it, there is no Allied 'decline' - we are just slower at growth these days and have to be smart about it, we still as a bloc are plenty powerful enough to keep the world chugging along, even CCP would basically screw themselves if they do something dumb (not to say they won't).

1. Tactical nukes -- Battlefield nukes, small enough to be used in an area where your army is staying at. All are smaller than 100 kilotons. 

2. Strategic nukes -- If these get launched, there's no choice but to start the Armageddon. Starting at 100 kilotons, Strategic nukes go all the way up to 100,000 kilotons. (100 Megatons)

-------

As an FYI: Hiroshima was 15 kilotons, while Nagasaki was 25 kilotons  and would be considered a ""small tactical nuke"" by today's standards. The Tsar Bomb (largest nuke ever made) is more powerful than 6-thousand Hiroshima bombs.... in a singular bomb. To give you the idea of how powerful nukes will get if we reach for strategic nukes.

------

Tactical nukes will provoke a strong conventional response at a minimum, and possibly a tactical nuclear response from the USA. The nukes being lobbed will be the largest bombs ever used in combat, but they're still small in the great scheme of things.

If strategic nukes start getting deployed, we very quickly will destroy the world. So hopefully we don't get there. But there's pretty much no choice. If the bombs reach that size, then there's no realm left over for escalation.

""Small"" Tactical nukes can still escalate in size to bigger ones. (IE: Don't piss us off or we'll pull out even bigger nukes against you). So IMO, it'd just make sense that the diplomats / generals will try to keep nuclear war at the tactical level if we ever get there.

Over time, he was approached as one of the sites that can post troves of whistleblower material.  And he has.  Many financials.  
 
However, he also doesn’t have the trained staff and ability to screen that those who were operating inside Russia the last ten years have had.  So his vetting is somewhat hampered. 

He has assisted multiple dissidents in escaping, which requires essentially coordinating an Underground Railroad, getting funds to various entities along the way, without raising suspicions—all from his home in..France iirc. So betrayal of course is stings and fakers can easily slip thru.  I mean, how is he supposed to ensure they’re not actually a war criminal? Fly in and administer a polygraph?

Wut?  WW2 Blitzkreig was about using vehicles and airplanes to conduct an offensive faster than anyone else ever saw in history.

The defining moment of Germany vs France was France expecting the Germans to take 1 month to cross the Ardennes Forest, but instead the Nazis crossed it in 3 days thanks to good scouting, and the high speed of tank warfare. Furthermore, France heavily invested into so called ""Heavy Armor infantry tanks"", that is, tanks that were so heavily armored they moved at the speed of infantry.

The French heavy tanks were near invulnerable vs the light German Panzers. But all the Germans would do was wait 4 hours for the French heavy tanks to run out of fuel, and then resume the fight.

I think it's broadly similar to the Stuka in WW2: overall, that thing had a relatively low kill count compared to other German aircraft, but they played the Stuka up in the minds of their opponents (both in propaganda and with that infamous dive horn) to the point that it was one of the most-feared planes on the ground. HIMARS isn't on that level, but it's definitely something the Russians are worried about, so if making the 20-something actual HIMARS seem like a bigger threat than they actually are (by lumping in the M270s and Mars 2s with them) helps to scare Russians shitless... it's worthwhile.

Then infantry crossed bridges, which the Belgians failed to blow, also defended by concrete pillboxes with a variety of weapons. 

The Nazis had to engage in WW1-style trench warfare to cross the 5-7 km wide isthmus from Ukraine into Crimea, with heavy losses, over a  few  weeks in late 1941. They lacked amphibious assault ability  in the Black Sea, and paratroop capability was very limited. Much of the fighting was supported by Stug 3 75mm motorized artillery, and involved infantry using rifles, automatic weapons and hand grenades to attack through minefields and barbed wire against Soviets in trenches. The Germans had air superiority.  German losses just crossing the isthmus were about 12,000.

People like us -- Dave-C, you, and me, and everyone else who ever posts in a public Reddit thread -- don't have informed theories on the Ukraine War. If we are posting here on this thread at all, then by definition we don't have the intel that is necessary to have in order to predict what will happen.

The Crimean options come from the actual military analysts and leaders in Ukraine and NATO. [Patreus, for example](https://www.newsweek.com/how-crimea-can-retaken-ukraine-russia-ben-hodges-1784066), as recently as February 2023, said that Ukraine does not have the capability to actually invade Crimea. Rather, the plan is to cut-off and starve the Russian troops on Crimea. It is similar to how they handled Kherson, only on a grander scale: They need the Russians to leave Crimea, and the only way to force them to do that is by starving them of supply.
