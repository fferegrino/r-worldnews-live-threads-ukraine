Tanks are bad at urban combat. They need infantry support. Without boots on ground they’re just big targets with poor visibility. Rifles should aim for the periscopes, but most importantly the sight unit on top of the turret.

Take down street signs. Don’t let the enemy know where they are. Move signs to the wrong streets. Tanks are super heavy, so try to direct them to streets that can’t hold their weight.

President Putin had met with Kazakhstan's President Tokayev last week, and Russia had supplied support for the government after a series of protests recently as well.

This is unverifiable info posted yesterday by a Ukrainian website. I’m guessing it’s fake but the saboteurs in Kyiv seem to be true.  


Translation:

The Ukrainian special services once again figured out Putin's scenario. But this time it is not only about the method of attack, but also its goals. ZN.UA received the information below from its own sources.

According to the operational plan of the Russian Federation, up to 2 thousand special forces are planned to capture one of the two airports in Kiev and air traffic control facilities, the indicated number of military personnel will ensure the arrival of the main group of forces in the amount of up to 10 thousand paratroopers by Il-76 aircraft, along with light armored vehicles and regular armament of the airborne troops (armored personnel carrier, Nonna, cars).

The landing operation will be controlled from the A-50 aircraft, which will be in the airspace of Belarus and the Russian Federation.

The first part of the landing may arrive from Belarus by helicopters or light aircraft.

At the same time, sabotage groups that are already on the territory of Ukraine must commit sabotage at power grids and substations in order to disconnect a significant part of the city from the power grid and communications, which will cause panic among the population.

According to the plan, separate groups of provocateurs should organize arson and acts of looting in order to further sow panic and focus the attention of law enforcement agencies on stabilizing the situation with public safety, and not on searching for saboteurs.

At this time, there will be a massive cyber attack on the authorities and other vital sites in Ukraine.

Before that, activation will take place at the front, provocations are possible along the entire border line with Ukraine, which will force the military-political leadership to take the bulk of combat-ready troops to the defense line, so a small number of troops will be in Kiev.

The task of the landing force is to block Kiev, communications, command and control channels, seize / blow up arsenals, sow panic as much as possible, create conditions for a panic exit from Kiev of ""uncontrolled columns of refugees"" that will block highways / roads, which will complicate the movement of troops, law enforcement agencies on the roads Kiev.

Further, to capture and control the main authorities - the OP, the General Staff, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada and hold them until the arrival of the main forces.

A day is given for the landing operation, the beginning - as soon as it is ready, late in the evening or at night.

The DATE of the operation is unknown, it is expected in the coming days, depending on the weather, the development of the political situation in the world and the negotiation processes.

The desired result is to seize the leadership of the state (it is not specified who exactly) and force them to sign a peace agreement on Russian terms under blackmail and the possibility of killing a large number of civilians.

Even if part of the leadership of the state is evacuated, one of the pro-Russian politicians will be able to take ""responsibility"" and sign documents, citing the ""flight"" of the political leadership from Kiev.

As a result, Ukraine can be divided into two parts - according to the principle of West and East Germany, or North and South Korea.

At the same time, the Russian Federation recognizes as legitimate that part of Ukraine that will sign these agreements and be loyal to the Russian Federation. Guided by the principle: ""who controls the capital controls the state.""",False,1645840688.0,t3_t1jfwh,t3_t1jfwh,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

Everyone who has any involvement with the military (of any nation) knows how Important logistics is especially after the first 12-24hrs. 


It leads me to believe that Russia thought they could establish a far enough breach into enemy territory that logistics would flow easily and with little harassment. Or alternatively that they could nut it out in a day. Obviously they didn't plan for what would happen if that didn't work out.


They should've had logistics warehouses near the border, heavy supply & repair depots in the rear echelon, smaller supply contingents (company-sized elements) behind the front line, and integral support for every company and/or battalion. It honestly astounds me how disorganized their logistics are, no modern military should be this underprepared logistically when they're fighting so close to home. 


Whoever is the head of Russian logistics whether that man is a logistician or a high-ranking officer in that position makes the Fyre festival look like competent logistics.

He's happy to ""give her space"" but he's fully convinced she's going to come back to him, and he's going to stalk her and make sure she doesn't date anyone else, because she definitely only loves him and if she DOES date anyone else it's because her evil friends are getting in her head.

Email your representative. I don't know where you live, but in the US contact your two state senators and the representative for your district. Email feels impersonal, because it is, but their staff do read them. You can also call their office. This is more personal, but you usually won't get through. When you do you'll get a staffer who you can explain your concern to. 

Calls and emails become part of their daily briefing from staff to boss and they pay attention. This is how they find out what people care about. Write and call and just be honest. It does make a difference.

You can also contact the senators and representatives for your state legislature. These guys have are state focused, so foreign stuff isn't something they can do a lot about, but they are much easier to contact. And when people at the state level start making noises about issues it makes those in washington pay more attention. I've had my state rep personally respond to my emails several times. Again, just be honest and tell them what your concern is and what you'd like them to do, even if all you know is, 'Help Ukraine, somehow.' Specifics are usually helpful though. 

So, that's a small, but real, thing you can do. You live in a democracy, probably, so make use of it.",False,1645841775.0,t3_t1jfwh,t1_hygli5w,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

2.  Those fast moving forces were supposed to capture airfields and other infrastructure so the remainder of the invasion force could be brought en masse via transport flights.  

Instead the Ukrainians would essentially let the troops move  into their territory too quickly and before they could be settled and link up with other units they’d launch a counteroffensive against a cut off enemy with limited supplies while the mechanized columns would be ambushed.

Edit:  These are pretty much the same tactics  the US used against Iraq.

As an example that can be seen right on reddit, back when the infrastructure bill was passed, there was a ton of comments in that specific thread on the topic going ""Ok but who cares about that what about my student loans?!?!?!?""

It is important to remember that people (voters) are inherently selfish, and they will care about the issues that affect them directly. This is not necessarily completely separate from our foreign policy either: keep in mind foreign policy objectives and approaches can vary depending on the political party in power.

Trump's influence on politics at this point is in potentially dividing the Republican party, as he still has enough supporters that Republican officials aren't sure whether they can afford to rebuke him. Those who try will likely face primary opponents in the next election cycle.

Biden is basically as expected, which wasn't much (at least in my view and understanding). Trump needed to go, and there could've been loads of better options, but Biden was the only one we had. The problem is that it takes time to build a truly progressive party, as it has to be built from the ground up: local elections, then state elections, then federal. Once you have enough progressives in the federal government, then progressive politics will have actual pull here. My worry is whether progressive supporters in the US can keep that in mind and not try to cost the Democrats seats out of spite because Bernie wasn't elected and didn't transform the system overnight.

We have a similar split regarding urban and rural politics, though of course it's not quite as simple as that. Gerrymandering remains a significant problem, which isn't being helped by the situation with the Supreme Court which is just a whole other conversation at this point.

So we don't know. I don't think anyone's satisfied by the way things are, and we're not agreeing on how to fix it.

Ukraine offers Russia no resources that it doesn't have itself.

If the war is protracted and Russia faces a long term opposition from the Ukrainian population. Then they have to spend even more keeping 45 million people in order.

It's not because Putin is a big fat meanie.

Decreasing GDP is not the issue - our reliance on oil and gas to heat houses and keep people fed is the problem. We can’t even get people to wear a mask to save their own countrymen, you think if the shelves are empty and  the power is out that there won’t be mass uprisings across the US and Europe?

Just say you have never had to think about these things before and that you wish we could save the Ukrainian people from this destruction. We all want that.

Ukraine has army reserves, set aside for when things escalate further. 200K army personnel for Ukraine are currently active with 900K in reserve.

Numbers aside, all descriptions I gave you of not going full power come from historical examples, such as the loss of a strong power because of improper tactics, such as going head-on in full power.

You didn't give any historical examples you just keep repeating its better to go slow with no evidence. ""Going full power"" doesn't mean he needs to destroy Kiev, but sending in as many troops and as high quality troops as possible is advantageous because the sooner he can take over Kiev and install a Russian friendly government, before aid comes from other countries, the better it is for Putin.
