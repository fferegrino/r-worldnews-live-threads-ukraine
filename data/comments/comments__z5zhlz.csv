Day 277 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another pretty quiet day with no missile strikes or drones and with only a single air raid alert throughout the entire day. That alert wasn’t that long ago either, it happened at 12:15am, there were no missile launches from Belgorod, but some explosions were reported in Kupiansk around the same time. Kupiansk is still well within the range of Russian artillery, so they will definitely continue shelling it until they are pushed back far enough.

The Russian side of the border also continues to get shelled by our forces pretty much every day. Today we had reports of Shebekino being shelled yet again. Apparently this time we took down their electricity there, as they were reporting blackouts right after shelling. That town sure does get hit a lot. Not that long ago, during one of the massive missile strikes on our infrastructure they actually landed some of their missiles in the streets of Shebekino, killing some of their own civilians in the process. I guess Russians really don’t care about their own people even a little bit, but somehow that doesn’t stop their civilians from completely supporting the war anyway. Are they just a nation of masochists?

There hasn’t been a new big missile strike in a couple of days, but there’s a chance it will happen tomorrow, so just in a couple of hours. Some movement of Russian long range bombers was spotted around Saratov today, which is what usually happens before a new missile strike. Though it still might not happen tomorrow (but it probably will happen sometime this week), because it has been less than a week since the last one, and usually it takes them a week or more to prepare a new missile strike after doing one.

>	When Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, one of their first targets was the city of Mariupol. The battle that followed is an epic story of resistance in which a very small number of Ukrainian fighters defended the city for over eighty days against a Russian force five to eight times their size, preventing the Russians from diverting to other parts of Ukraine. In this episode, John Spencer is joined by Aiden Aslin, a British citizen who took part in that battle and was captured by Russian forces there in April 2022. His experiences offers a unique view of how the Battle of Mariupol unfolded, and the details of his captivity as a Russian prison of war for over five months offer a glimpse into an often unseen aspect of the war.

Russian command often wont let the wounded Russians evacuate to get medical care.

This is definitely the situations in Donbas, but perhaps not as much in the North or in the Southern Buh (where Russians had commandeered many hospitals).  So the wounded are stuck in battle, forced to keep fighting like some knight from Monty python. 

Further skewing the numbers—by midsummer, once the losses were high, Russian commanders began rotating the lightly injured who’d been convalescing in Crimea back into the fields.

This is all true in terms of the militia.  

Not in terms of there being a “tiny minority” of pro-Russian sentiments (Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Melitopol all have had rather large pro-Russia populations—although that soured after the invasion). Extensively reading Ukrainian press, I just simply disagree with many of these assertions.  Even the pro-Ukrainian Mariupol press would disagree with the wildly inaccurate “only a tiny minority” [the city with the largest pro-Russia sentiments, where folks who’ve fled blamed it on Ukraine allowing diversity of opinion/politics, and the bulk of tv programming being from Russia and thus poisoning minds]. My translations and postings history should show countless articles of this.

I cannot stress this enough; Ukraine **will win**. There is no scenario where they do not.

And **that is when its imperative we stay behind Ukraine, and keep up support, keep pushing our politicians, keep showing the Ukrainians our love and support, keep donating and don't give in to defaitism and calls for negotiation**.

The gist of it is this: for every piece of equipment given to Ukraine that is not native to their own forces, but *especially* for tanks, behind every item you need an uninterrupted supply chain of hundreds of thousands of widgets/parts, engine blocks, transmissions, barrels, screwdrivers and bolts of countless proportions, and teams of mechanics providing around the clock maintenance.

Otherwise, these tanks will become *very* expensive paperweights after twelve hours of marching to the front and springing a leak before they're even in the fight.

Same reason we don't give them F-16s. Training the pilots isn't even the hard part. It's having crews who know every wire and bolt in the aircraft and knowing when it's certified for a safe flight. It takes a long time for training.

Just to clarify.  Is this what you mean:

> There are Russians (Russian sympathizers?) who were not posting trash about Ukraine conflict on social media in July.  They are either spending more time or new users are generating content.  New strategic developments motivated the change.  The intent is to persuade the West in regards to aid or western pressure on Ukraine.  

Does that sound right?  

I know i personally do not have an order of magnitude estimate of how many people are doing anything on the internet or social media.  

Ukraine losing power must have cut Ukraine's internet presence.  

It sounded like Twitter was the primary change.  I don't use twitter except links from here.  Twitter staff changes sound problematic or at least a reason for uncertainty.  

A possibility to throw out suppose the algorithms were routing the pro-Ukraine users to pro-Ukraine content and pro-Russia users to pro-Russia content.  Everyone is in their eco chamber.  Then the algorithm or sortation breaks and suddenly all chambers are in a big stadium together.  People would suddenly hear voices opposed to their own view that they did not see before.  I am not claiming any evidence that this did happen.  There might really be a new Russian internet strategy.  I am just not sure how to tell the difference.  

I do want to add (in case anyone from Ukraine is reading) that efforts on social media have no chance of working out for Russia in USA.  People in Ukraine should really not let this be a source of stress.  Moving pro-Russia from 20% to 30% would be really impressive and still fail completely. Of course a failed strategy does not mean Russians won't try it. ( Maybe it matters in Europe and India I don't know).

Several other factors are mixed in. The US soldiers were wearing better helmets and ballistic plates.  So some bullets that would have quickly killed via heart or brain became non-lethal.  A bullet in the hand has not changed.  A much higher portion of US casualties were from IED and rockets fired at vehicles.  There were more burn wounds and bits of sand or rocks from flying concrete.  

Fire fights in Iraq or Afghanistan would have had US (or coalition) vehicles swarming in plus air support.  Insurgents will hit and then move away either running or hiding.  You cannot drive an ambulance across trench fields.  Helicopters are rash if your opponent (Ukraine) is still fighting and is equiped with large numbers of stinger missiles.  

Then also there is plenty of video evidence that recovering wounded is not a high priority.  The Russians are making almost no effort to recover their dead.  

USA is an extreme opposite.  The Army will nit only recover dead US soldiers but they try to recover every piece of dead soldiers.  Anything they cannot recover has to be documented along with extensive explanations for what went wrong and why that bone could nit be found.  

I am inclined toward the US Army's view on this.  However, you van easily make the counter argument.  The lives of soldiers who are not dead have value.  If they send an extra ambulance then that means they are short a tank or truckload of ammunition.  Not fighting a war gets the lowest number of casualties. Winning a war quickly reduces them a great deal.  I am not saying Russian/Soviet doctrine is correct.

>I was giving you the opportunity to revoke your bad faith argument. 

No you weren't. The reason I cited that was very clearly to do with the fact that my family has suffered in the past at the hands of a regime and my opinions regarding what is warranted in that situation. And I was talking about the US's hypocritical stance. **But out of all of that, out of all the separate discussions you could have responded to, the one thing you chose to cite about my response is that i'm Jewish.** Since you seem to fundamentally not know what a bad faith argument is here, I'll give you a lesson in one. 

>How dare you use the suffering of your family as an argument to let others suffer. Have you learned nothing?

Are you seriously telling a Jewish person how they should interpret their family dying in the holocaust? You're telling me i dont have a right to consider my families past? Are you seriously going to sit around and tell me I don't have a right to understand current events through the history of oppression and genocide my family has been through? Probably be better if Jews pretended the holocaust didnt happen huh. 

>Have you learned nothing?

Wow. You're asking a jewish person if they have learned nothing from the holocaust because I said i wouldn't mind if a couple germans died so my family could live. 
lol

I was very clear that cutting meds was only acceptable for the purpose of saving ukrainian lives and I dont know the answer to the calculation (dont worry more on this later you dumb fuck).  Presenting my argument as though I said ""well maybe we should kill random russian civilians just for fun"" is a badfaith argument and a strawman. 

>Also, whatever calculation you think you’re referring to, either present it or suck it. How can you possibly think that such medication has an effect on the war effort. 

Generally accepted thought on sanctions is that the more important the resource you cut off from the enemy, the more pressure it puts on them and the more effective the sanctions become. Essential medicine is one of the most important resources. 9/10 will agree to both of these points. Given that, your argument is essentially ""you have to prove medicine is important enough that it will put pressure on the kremlin"". If that sounds dumb, its because it is, and given that the commonly accepted knowledge goes against your statement, the burden of proof is on you. You're claiming that mcdonalds pulling out of russia will put more pressure on the kremlin than western medicine being cut off, and saying that i need to prove otherwise lmfao. 

Now I wasn't saying we *should* do that. I was trying to discuss the tradeoffs, why we are not doing it, and some ways in which it seems hypocritical. If the best you can do in response to that is say ""durr killing people bad"" and make antisemitic-adjacent comments, this is the wrong thread for you, and I suggest you return to wherever people have similar dietary restrictions to you (eating paint chips).",1669600726.0,1669596545.0,t3_z5zhlz,t1_iy1bdz5,,6,0,0,0,0,0,
