> “Talking about Ukraine joining NATO in exchange for giving up part of Ukrainian territories is absolutely unacceptable. We have always proceeded from the fact that the alliance, like Ukraine, does not trade territories,” Speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Oleh Nykolenko said.

> The representative of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry noted that the ""conscious or unconscious"" participation of NATO officials in the formation of such a narrative ""plays into the hands of Russia.""

> “It is in the interests of Euro-Atlantic security to discuss ways to accelerate Ukraine's victory and its acquisition of full NATO membership. We are committed to further fruitful cooperation with the NATO Secretariat to achieve these goals,” he added.

-- Oleh Nykolenko on his Facebook

> Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, called Stian Jenssen's statement ""a very strange proposal.""

> “It symbolizes that some of the political elites have still not developed a complete understanding of the situation, a complete understanding of the nature of this war. I would even say more, this clearly fits into the logic of the “freeze” scenario that Russia so desperately craves,” he said.

> Podolyak believes that such a ""solution"" to the war ""absolutely will not stop subsequent tragedies, escalations, attacks.""

> “From here is a simple conclusion: it seems to me extremely absurd to continue to look for ways not to respond to the main challenge of today, it is extremely absurd to try to frankly transfer the war to the next generation and no less absurd ... to openly admit defeat,” Podolyak added.

>For starters, Gfoeller and Rundell claim that Russia “invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.” But they are eight years late: Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2014, when Vladimir Putin’s forces seized and then illegally annexed Crimea, a sovereign part of Ukraine. 
>
>They then claim that because Ukraine is not a NATO member, the United States “has no legal obligation to defend it.” But the US promised Ukraine a free and sovereign future in 1994, when it signed the Budapest Declaration, in exchange for Ukraine’s decision to surrender its nuclear weapons. Russia signed this document, too.

>Gfoeller and Rundell next state that since 1999 “NATO has added 15 new members” and “advanced 1,000 miles eastward.” They do not spell out exactly how this is relevant to the strategic calculus of whether to oppose Russia’s full-scale invasion of its peaceful neighbor, so one can only infer that they are suggesting that Putin was somehow provoked. One detects a similarly enabling thread in their statement that Russia possesses a nuclear stockpile “at least as large as” that of the United States. 
>
>This logic implies that the best way to prevent a nuclear war is to abandon vulnerable nations to the depredations of leaders who threaten to start one. Such a stance would incentivize weaker countries around the world to pursue their own nuclear weapons. Moreover, Putin has no intention of starting a war with an alliance that has a gross domestic product over 20 times the size of Russia’s. 
>
>Instead, Putin’s goal is to separate Ukraine from its Western backers and create a one-on-one matchup he can win. Thanks in part to American support, he is struggling. Western assistance has helped Ukraine degrade one of America’s top adversaries. To date, Ukraine has destroyed 11,638 pieces of Russian military equipment, including 2,218 main battle tanks, 2,635 infantry fighting vehicles, 276 pieces of towed artillery, 255 multiple rocket launchers, 84 aircraft, 101 helicopters, and 13 naval ships—all without shedding a single drop of American blood.
>
>Ukraine can win this fight. Its attrition of Russian forces and logistics has put enormous strain on the Russian system, strain that led to Yevgeny Prigozhin’s spectacular march on Moscow earlier this summer. It is in the interest of the West that Ukraine liberates its territories. This includes the Crimean Peninsula, with its deep ties to Ukraine, so that it can regain unfettered access to the Black Sea and resume major commerce with the outside world. Anything less will effectively transform Ukraine into a landlocked basket case dependent on Western aid in perpetuity. It is far better for the West to support Ukraine now than face even greater costs later.

Just now I am watching a video of Putin, lazily sitting in his imperial office chair and flanked by flags, claiming that Poland is about to betray Ukraine and seize its western territories as well as attack Belarus. This nonsense narrative has been circulating for a while now in Russian propaganda, and this video makes it unclear to me whether he is actually the prime driver for it. Previously I had thought it was just propaganda nonsense. Given his usual beliefs on geopolitics, which tend to be mildly delusional at best, I think it is possible he actually believes it might happen. There is an element of psychological projection in him believing that everyone is as dastardly and cynical as he is.  
  
The battle on the southern front has resulted in small victories for Ukraine this week. In a town called Urozhaine, a whole company of Russians was destroyed by cluster munitions in a short video clip captured, and the town seems to be in something like no man's land at the moment. Near Orikhiv, more small advances have been recorded.  
  
Of interest this week has been the Russian economy. The ruble has started to plummet again, reaching 100 per 1 USD the other day. Nabiullina is like Sisyphus endlessly rolling the boulder up the hill, and even if she makes the correct decision every time, it will eventually all come undone. This week she raised the interest rate by 3.5% to 12% to try to stop the hemorrhaging. There are various problems noted by economists with the Russian economy - a labour shortage made worse by military drafts and by citizens fleeing, a massive drop in automobile production, a ballooning wartime budget with a corresponding deficit increase. I don't get the impression that it is all going to collapse any time soon, but the initial stability it showed after the first shocks of the invasion seems to have largely given way to a kind of rot which is slowly setting in. I am not sure that a real collapse with hyperinflation is even on the horizon, but it could look like a sort of shrivelling in a year or two from now.",False,1692100871.0,t3_15rhlht,t3_15rhlht,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

> The former minister told the publication that in Russia he was prosecuted twice (in 2005 and 2016), and was acquitted both times. Sharonov calls both cases ""illegal"" and ""fabricated.""

> “In February 2022, the so-called “operation” began. If earlier people who wanted to change something were simply ejected from the system, in 2022 this began to transform. Now anyone not toeing the official line became more than undesirable, they became targets. If there was a person, they would find a crime,” Sharonov explained.

> After his dismissal, the former minister ""began to receive signals"" that it was not safe for him to stay in Russia. During the mobilization, Sharonov was sent a summons: “Although, in principle, I’m not exactly suitable due to my age. I realized that this was a signal from the republic where I worked. It's just a way to get rid of unwanted people. I was lucky [during] the previous two persecutions, but this time I knew that I could not fight back. I had no choice but to flee the country.”

> He told RTVI that he currently works as a truck driver and hopes to find employment in the agricultural sector in the future.

Today, Leonid Volkov (Navalny's chief of staff, based in Lithuania) tweeted the results of a poll they conducted. According to their poll, 34-39% of people in France and Germany approve of putin, and similar percentages blame America for russia's war against Ukraine. https://twitter.com/leonidvolkov/status/1691490568445079561

Moreover, Volkov claims the poll shows that ""putin's narrative"" that the war is ""russia's war, not putin's war"" has failed, despite the kremlin's efforts.

In his thread, Volkov promoted an international anti-Putin protest on Aug. 20 (the anniversary of the poisoning of Navalny). https://putin-killer.com/

However, every other recent poll by reputable pollsters and new agencies completely disagrees with the results of the Navalny team's poll.

Last July, a Pew Research Center poll revealed that ""across 24 countries surveyed, views of Russia are overwhelmingly negative, with a median of 82% saying they have an unfavorable opinion of the country, compared with 15% who say they have a favorable view."" [86% in Germany and 82% in France have an unfavorable opinion of russia. These findings come from a Pew Research Center survey conducted from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023, among 30,861 people in 24 countries].

Navalny's team's poll had small sample sizes, 554 to 800 respondents in France and Germany, respectively. Perhaps this was the reason for the surprising results.

Lastly, it is ridiculous that after 538 days of russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, Navalny's team finally organizes a large protest but chose to protest only against putin instead of also protesting against russia's war crimes, the murders and kidnappings of thousands of Ukrainian children, etc.

She escaped from there in 2019 and she tells me quite often about the mentality of the people in Donetsk and this makes me feel like the battle for the city (if there is one) would be the worst of the entire war. 


The war for Ukrainians in the Donbas has lasted almost ten years. The propaganda in that time has been completely insane, every single day since occupation has been a constant bombardment of lies. Nobody is immune to propaganda (that includes us in the West) and the ones who don't listen to it are now so apathetic that they see the Russian army and Ukrainian army as just as bad as each other. The Russians spent the whole of last year conducting roundups - my girlfriend's father could not leave the house for fear of being grabbed and thrown into a van by the local Commandant. When they're rounded up they're sent immediately to Bakhmut or Mariupol while the Russian soldiers go to less active areas of the frontline. With the frontline closing in, those who did not leave are now trapped in an increasingly tightening pocket. 


Donetsk is huge and is the main hub for the Russian army in the East. The population will likely not be welcoming to the Ukrainian army, and the Russians will not let it go.

Russia had invested little to nothing into the occupied regions because why would they care more about land and people in Ukraine than they would about ""real"" Russian's in Russia itself?

Propaganda does have its limits and has to somewhat match what people see themselves to be effective. A lot of the prowar propaganda in Russia takes strands of the truth, like NATO getting closer or the wests liberal ideals infecting Russia, and spins them into threats. The thing is propaganda is very ineffective in convincing someone their life is better when it has clearly gotten worse, less access to health care, fewer jobs decaying infrastructure. And eastern Ukraine was already pretty poor. It's important to remember that the so called ""separatist movement"" in the east was set up and financed by the FSB, it was not a naturally occurring movement. Just because a lot of people in the region had political differences with the generally more liberal western part of Ukraine doesn't mean they wanted to separate, let alone pick up a gun and murder other Ukrainian's.

He doesn't seem to understand the non-military side of this. From a military standpoint, his position makes some sense, however, he doesn't seem to grasp the mental/emotional concepts attach to that and what it would enable...

From the end of WW2, the West has been following the doctrine of nation's self-determination. However, the application of the principle was always very selective and hypocritical. For example, why post-WW2 Germany had a right to self-determination, but Baltic states had not? In the 90's it seemed that majority of Europe is pretty much settled with their borders except of cases of collapsing Yugoslavia, and what had now become an independent Russia. 

Russia was doing proxy shit in the mid-to-late 90's and early 2000's, fighting in their internationally recognised borders internally (Chechnya), but they hadn't really stepped out of their borders. They started to test waters in Georgia in 2008, and saw an opportunity in Ukraine in 2014. Finally, the main war started in 2022.

By allowing Russia a landgrab we would validate the imperialism of the Russian society as somewhat acceptable, deny the right of self-determination and validity of International agreements, and Russians would find new propaganda and proxy targets where this could be used very quickly. Georgia, for example. Belarus. Or even Baltics/Poland/Finland by trying to destabilise the society.

Ukraine is making gains nearly every day. Not massive gains, but 2-3 kilometers every day is notable progress. Not only that, they are making progress where it matters most. They are making clear and effective inroads to the southern regions of Ukraine towards the hub cities of Tokmak, Mariupol and Berdyans'k. And most importantly they've begun crossing Russia's **defense lines**. That's huge considering most of that area is the Ukrainian steppe region of flat open land. So they are crossing Russians main defense in that area. Besides that the best they can hope for is thin tree lines or small villages to temporarily buy cover, both of which we've seen Ukraine push through easily. Then consider the fact that Ukraine hasn't even put half of the reserves they allocated to the counter-offensive and it's really amazing what Ukraine continues to accomplish.

No, it won't be as quick and overwhelming as the US in Iraq or Ruzzia in Georgia, because Ukraine has been held back by lack of modern equipment and ammunition against a larger force that did have those advantages. But they are winning out with better strategy, better training and better weapons. If Russia doesn't realize they've already lost and give up this war will be protracted *at least* another 3 years in my opinion, but likely 5. Because as Ukraine makes this slow progress it will inevitably cut off Russian land-based resupply routes to Zaporizhzhia and Crimea, which will collapse any kind of defense they can muster for Crimea or the Kerch Bridge. Crimea will be isolated and starved of food, water and ammunition until they are forced to surrender or just lose their positions. The Russian Black Sea fleet has already proven itself to be wholly ineffective as it has lost and continues to lose more and more ships to a country without a Navy. Ukraine already attacks their ports in both Sevastopol and Novorossiysk to the point they keep many ships in the harbour in an attempt to protect them because they are vulnerable at sea. And aor resupplying is just not practical from a realistic or financial standpoint. They could only fly in so much cargo at once, and each flight would cost way too much to keep it up regularly. Not to mention they'd be easy pickings for Ukrainian air defense systems if Ukraine are far enough south to blockade Crimea. Plus by that time the Ukrainian air force will have F-16s to challenge for air superiority, so Russians one main advantage will be gone. 

Meanwhile what does Russia do? Missile attacks on civilian infrastructure that decrease in number each time and are more and more often shot down before they reach their targets. Or they try to push in the Kupiansk region in the north with tens of thousands of soldiers for next to no gains in a move with very little strategic benefit. Which is similar to Bakhmut which they are still struggling to hold and defend. Of course they propped up Bakhmut as a big victory to the citizens back home, even though it really doesn't have any significance, but it was something they actually won after losing so many kilometers of land in the north earlier in that time, including Kharkiv and Lyman. They needed something to rally around to promote the Russian army's successes and make this war not seen like a useless quagmire. So now they are stuck trying to defend this useless flattened city because they made it out to be Russia's big, and only victory back home and can't afford to lose it now or else their credibility goes with it.

Sanctions have led to rising prices across Russia - think of less imports of widgets and demand for these widgets items exceeding what Russia can domestically produce. This raises prices.

So, what one ruble could buy a year ago is now less than what one ruble can buy today. You actually need 1.22 rubles.

Raising rates lowers the amount of money people are willing to borrow and spend, which ultimately depresses prices because there is less rubles in circulation.

After the war, thanks to the sanction the volume of trading was low, and westerns aren't allowed to trade on their market.

So they could artificially stabilise the value.  


These das they sell a lot more to india and china, accept foreign currency instead of rubles. Combine it with a higher volume, and you get a lower value.  


No one wants rubles, not even Russia. They rather have rupees or yuans these days.  


Increasing intrest makes it more intresting to ""own"" rubles, you get 12% of the value back in intrest.

I disagree. DeSantis doesn't motivate the base the same way Trump does, and that really matters. Three things critical to any candidate in a general election are being to bring out the base, woo swing voters, and not energize opposing voters. DeSantis doesn't do well on any of these. 

DeSantis doesn't have the cult of personality that Trump does. He doesn't generate the crowds that Trump does, and there aren't good indications that he'd be able to motivate voters in key states. 

While not as toxic as Trump, DeSantis doesn't do well with independents. And his campaign has generated a lot of content that is very alienating to center-leaning voters. To have a good chance at the general he needs to bring back former republicans, instead he's tried to out right-wing Trump. 

DeSantis is very motivating for Democrat leaning voters. His legislative and executive record in Florida provide strong motivation for those lukewarm on Biden to vote for him anyway. Sleep Joe is meh, but DeSantis is a nightmare.

Anyone that cared about how much money we spend on bombs and missiles and shit has already said it until we're blue in the face, and it has approximately zero impact on our voting patterns at this point because there isn't a candidate against spending trillions on the MIC, just one okay with giving the weapons created to countries being attacked by fascists, and one that is okay with taking bribes from the fascist countries attacking.

A lathe needs bearings, and whatever it produces will likely need even more for the final product.

Later in the war, after the bearing factories were bombed - not only was total output of such war machines heavily reduced in quantity, but the quality also suffered due to the ever increasing demand and ever increasing number of bombed bearing factories.

Emergency simplified production design changes were approved for various things; for example: 

Last month your factory built ten complete tanks per week. 

Now it can only build 5 complete tanks per week due to bearing shortages, *or* you can build 6 tanks per week, but instead of the commander cupola sitting on bearings and able to spin 360 degrees you weld the cupolas into place - save the bearings and squeeze out a 6th tank.

Then just keep riding the shit coaster *alllll* the way to shit town as things got worse and more desperate for the Germans. 

No bearings? Simplified tanks. No metallurgical components from Norway? Now you got tanks that look the part but their armor literally cracks when struck - assuming you've created enough synthetic fuel to actually run the damn thing - since the Soviets slapped your hand away from the Baku oil fields, you'll have to create synthetic engine fuels out of *coal*. How efficient... 

Low on copper? Well, not *every* tank needs an electric motor to rotate the turret rapidly. Let's save the copper for something more critical and just have them hand crank it for all the tanks in this week's batch.

Can't make your fancy jet engines needed for your wunderwaffe Me262 jet fighter/bomber cause ya ain't got enough ball bearings nor access to proper alloys any longer?? Well, they just made half-disposable **rocket** powered planes (not jet - rocket engines) out of *wood* that went fast as all hell for a handful of minutes (enough time to reach altitude and do one or two attack runs on a B-17) and literally had no way of landing. 

The pilot pulled a lever and the thing would fall apart around him and it's wooden body, with burnt out rocket motor and dry of ammo, would parachute to the ground, not at all unlike an inexpensive hobby rocket kit. Imagine a plane, designed such that the pilot, in the best case scenario, must bail out and parachute to survive.

* Many large entities have a great deal of value tied up in assets that are not easy to convert to cash quickly. For example, a factory can be worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, but it's hard to find a buyer for one at the drop of a hat, and even if you could, you would probably rather use that factory to make products that you can sell. Taking out a loan allows you to use the value of your assets to help finance your day-to-day operations.

* You might not have predictable or consistent cash flow coming in. For example, if I make large capital goods (like construction equipment, tanks or airplanes), I might only make a few sales each year. Those sales will be massive, but I never know when one will happen. So taking out a loan against those future sales allows me to have operating cash on hand so I can pay my workers and my suppliers.

* Keeping your liquid cash locked up in interest-bearing accounts allows you to extract more value from it, but those interest accounts might have stipulations about when and how you can withdraw funds from them. Maintaining loans allows you to benefit from this without crippling your ability to function.

There are probably more reasons I'm not thinking of, but those are some of the reasons why larger entities operate off of loans.

However - and you maybe saw this coming - all of this relies on interest rates being relatively low. If your interest rate is 2%, then you can do all of the above, barely make a profit, and still be able to service your loans. If your interest rate is 14%, then interest payments are suddenly a huge expense and you have to either raise your prices or find new customers just to break even.",False,1692118747.0,t3_15rhlht,t1_jwasqlm,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

With F-16s that gets completely flipped. Ukraine will have no trouble acquiring targets and firing without taking losses from significantly farther away. Effectively they will gain air superiority, as Russian aircraft will no longer be able to operate close enough to the front to have any effect on it.

It requires organization, which itself required the ability to communicate and trusted leaders who people will follow. People need clear and effective instructions from leaders who have a reputation for it, and where those leaders fall, new ones must rise up to take their place.

It requires an alternative idea and cause to fight for, or in other words it needs politicians or an opposition government who actually offer something different. People won't risk their lives to fight without any hope or promise of something better.

It requires groups of people with the means to confront the regime, or in other words paramilitaries and fighters. Even a huge amount of unarmed average citizens will not fare well against an organized and armed police state. Russia's police state already numbers over a million and they employ a lot of force-multiplying tactics from sabotage to acts of extreme violence.

The Russian revolution had all of these. The Russian Empire had little to no way to stop people communicating and organizing with each other. The cause / idea was unlike anything seen before, and the opposition leaders and government was there from the beginning to coordinate efforts and give people a set of figures to follow and trust. And on top of that, most of the fighting was actually done by the army and soldiers, not the people.

Modern Russians have none of these things. The only way to safely communicate and organize is in person, and you can't coordinate an uprising of hundreds of thousands, let alone millions that way. Anyone who starts to gain trust or influence as a potential opposition leader either dies, rots in prison, or flees abroad. There is no opposition government or politician to fight for, no idea or concept to champion. There are no paramilitaries or fighters with anywhere near the ability to take on the army, FSB, National Guard, GRU, etc. Even if half of the country was ready to participate in an uprising, there is just no way it could happen. 

For another reference, Ukrainians in Euromaidan had all three of the requirements I just mentioned - they were able to organize action freely on Facebook and Twitter, they had leaders and opposition government to fight for, and armed groups and people ready to enforce it. Even then, the percentage of the adult population who participated in Euromaidan was somewhere around 5% or less (according to my napkin maths). Not to diminish their heroism, of course, but the point being that even when you have all the ingredients for an uprising, you can't rely on more than around 3-5% of people to even participate in it, even if a much larger portion supports it.

So it's not just because Russians support Putin or are apathetic - things which are certainly true to a sickening extent, but it is also just virtually impossible for an uprising to happen anyway.",False,1692098569.0,t3_15rhlht,t1_jw9j4hx,,4,10,0,10,0,0,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/12/21/patriot-missile-system-ukraine-russia/

>Zelensky has sought the Patriot system for months, as Russia carries out a barrage of lethal strikes that have extended well beyond military targets, according to U.S. and Ukrainian assessments, and left much of the country without electricity, heat and running water. After months of refusing those entreaties, in recent weeks senior administration officials recommended to Biden that the air defense system be sent to Kyiv.

The Biden administration waited months to approve training for the Patriots while Ukraine's cities were being bombarded with missiles - the stated reason being that it would be too hard to train Ukrainian's to use them. 

>Its not like we can send F-35s over there

No one said we have to - send Ukraine what they actually are asking for, when they ask for it, not 6 months too late.  You're making up BS arguments because you don't have a leg to stand on.

To avoid detection by Russian air defense (read: not get blown out of the sky almost immediately after takeoff), they would need to fly at low-level altitude which limits the ability to use guided munitions such as the JASSM.

For maybe a short period of time in a localized area, pilots might have the ability to fly at higher altitude towards FLOT. Not because radar systems would be destroyed, but because they would be suppressed. Once it's safe again the radar systems would be turned back on and any destroyed air defense system will be replaced.
