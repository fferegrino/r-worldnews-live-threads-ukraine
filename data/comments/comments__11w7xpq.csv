d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,11w7xpq,jcwxr7j,"The Ukrainian Armed Forces conducted a successful counterattack west of Bakhmut and pushed back the Russians in the area of the highway near the settlement of Ivanovske — Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

As confirmation, experts use geolocation footage published on March 19. They show that Ukrainian forces conducted a successful counterattack southwest of Ivanovsky (6 km west of Bakhmut) and pushed Russian forces away from the T0504 route in this area. In turn, Russian sources released footage purportedly showing a column of Ukrainian armored vehicles along T0504 southwest of Kostyantynivka (22 km southwest of Bakhmut) and suggested that the Ukrainians were preparing to launch a counteroffensive there.

Fears about this development of events are also expressed by some Russian soldiers, which may indicate a growing uncertainty about the ability of the Russian military to retain the initiative around Bakhmut.

In general, the ISW believes that the so-called great spring offensive of the Russian Federation in the east of Ukraine is reaching its climax and is not giving the desired effect, even despite the use of about 300 thousand manpower. Analysts believe that the general exhaustion of enemy forces gives the Ukrainians the opportunity to launch their own counteroffensive on critical areas of the front in the near future.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 20 March 2023.  


* Over the past three weeks, Russian forces have made creeping gains around the Ukrainian-held Donbas town of Avdiivka, immediately north of Donetsk city.  

* The Russian operation has largely been carried out by the 1st Army Corps of the Donetsk People’s Republic; local personnel who will know the terrain well. Avdiivka has been on the front line of the Donbas conflict since 2014; the city is now largely destroyed.  

* The sprawling Avdiivka Coke Plant complex is likely to be seen as particularly defendable key terrain as the battle progresses.  

* Tactically, the situation is similar to that in the larger town of Bakhmut, further north. Ukrainian forces continue organised defence, but their supply lines to the west are increasingly threatened by the Russian envelopment operation.

Dear Sergey Kuzhugetovich!

Currently, units of PMC “Wagner” control about 70% of the settlement of Bakhmut and continue the offensive for its complete liberation.

According to available information, in late March - early April, the enemy is planning to launch a large-scale offensive and perform flank cut-off strikes in order to cut off the units of the PMC “Wagner” from the main forces of the RF Armed Forces.

I ask you to take all necessary measures to prevent the cut-off of the PMC “Wagner” from the main forces of the Russian Armed Forces, which will lead to negative consequences for the Special Military Operation.

He explains it’s the next Bakhmut because the Defenders are under just as much, if not more, attacks from Russia and the logistics are extremely difficult for Ukraine. A spokesperson for the Armed Forces agreed that Avdiivka “could be second bakhmut,” pointing to concentration of Russian forces and attempts to surround the city.

*Difficult to supply the Defenders:*

> The logistics are complicated, because the entire road to Avdiivka, about 10-12 kilometers long, is shot at; all the neighboring villages of the Ocheretyne community are also constantly under fire: artillery, Grads, and rocket attacks... Basically, all the villages we go through to reach Avdiivka are under fire. That's why the city's logistics are complicated,"" said Barabash.

[I sorta thought it was obvious?]. They mention several reasons, including rapid growth, rapid promotions/advancement, structure—they also include the high losses and need for replacement—1,800—but I found that number high. They delve into the responsibilities of junior officers, how the loss of junior officers can lead to entire battalion suffering, and the experience vs education debate [both seen as vital]. 

> ""Looking at who has the appropriate skills is very easily manifested in a person - the skills of effective management. Such people should be promoted, their qualifications should be taken out for training. But someone at this time must perform combat tasks. As a result, we will pay a certain price for this in one way or another. We must also understand that our enemy is in the same, if not worse, situation. As a result, it somewhat balances the negative tendencies that we have. And, in principle, with the right approach, it is actually possible to stop a certain not degradation, but a certain fall in potential - to stop, level and go uphill. But for this, unfortunately, it is necessary to detach actually promising people from carrying out combat tasks now and send someone else to sacrifice themselves. This is a difficult moral dilemma. Let's say so. And this again leads to that no matter what - there will be a flurry of criticism. Even in the best scenario, when the best people from the point of view of performing the function of sergeants, junior officers will be identified, sent for training and then used,"" says Mykola Beleskov.

> The Ukrainian army lacks officers due to losses and the growth of the structure of the armed forces. The social elevator for many young fighters is rapid. They get new positions, and with them new responsibilities very quickly. And not everyone agrees with her. On the one hand, this is a new generation of officers, which can affect changes in the army and a more active transition to Western standards, on the other hand, the war does not allow fighters who fight without rotations to receive the necessary training - to be more effective in the fight with Russia and avoid losses.

> The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine allowed the granting of officer ranks to military personnel who have combat experience but do not have a military higher education.

> The explanatory note states that Ukraine needs high-quality officers, who could become non-commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers with military service and combat experience. 
However, Article 20 of the Law of Ukraine specifies that the condition for assigning the primary military rank of an officer and accepting military service under a contract is the successful completion of training at higher military educational institutions. 

> Thus, during the period of martial law, the Council allowed soldiers without a higher military education, but with combat experience, to be recruited into military service under a contract and to be given primary officer rank. For this, the soldier had to undergo military service in the combat zone for at least 6 months.

Because of China's neutrality, China's relations with Western capitals have soured. This is ludicrous because China has nothing to do with this war.

We can have different opinions on Navalny and that’s okay. We should be able to criticize decisions made by Zelensky, Biden, Scholtz, Sunak, Macron, Erdogan and Duda. All of these leaders have made notable contributions in many ways and all have fallen short in some ways.

https://www.aerosociety.com/news/ukraine-time-to-fast-track-front-line-fighter-pilot-training/

>Q: **How long is a western fighter pilots' training? And how short/abridged do you think a conversion course for Ukrainian pilots could be?**

>A: **Conversion to a front line combat aircraft for a new pilot would usually take about six months to become limited combat ready. However, a more experienced pilot would take less than half that time, and someone requalifying on type after a break would only take a few weeks.** If operational reasons demanded, then a much shorter course for experienced pilots learning a new type, focussed only on the relevant tactics and weapons, could be done in four to six weeks, much of which could be done on simulators.

-

>Q: What would be the best type to send them? MiG-29s from Poland/Slovakia would require minimal training, but give them parity, whereas surplus F-16s/18/F-15s could give them the edge? Could the UK's Tranche 1 Typhoons even be donated to give them overmatch - given they are set to be disposed of in a couple of years anyway? Or even surplus A-10s to take on Russian tanks?



>A: The more familiar the type the easier the conversion. However, **Western types are fairly user-friendly (especially the F- series) and relatively simple to grasp the basics. The stick, throttle and handling basics are simple transferable skills. Using the radar, avionics, weapons and defensive aids is the area of focus and teaching the basics of employment of those shouldn't take too long to achieve a level capable of matching or even overmatching the apparent poor Russian proficiency.**",False,1679321238.0,t3_11w7xpq,t1_jcxj1gl,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

1. Time to consider pulling back with some face-saving compromise  
  
2. Green light to keep going or even go in harder  
  
3. Nothing either way from China's leader

With option one, if it involves Beijing again being able to claim the mantle of global peacemaker following the Iran-Saudi deal, this would be quite a neat feather in Xi's cap.  
  
The main problem with that option is the extent to which it would also benefit China.  
  
The bleakest of options is number two, but there is a reading whereby Russia's war with Ukraine plays into Beijing's geopolitical strategy. The Kremlin is taking on the West, eating up Nato resources and, the longer the war goes on, the more it tests the appetite of the Western public for yet more conflict if the People's Liberation Army should move to take Taiwan by force.  
  
The calculation from Beijing could be that, the longer the war continues, the fewer people are going to want to get involved in another one.

China is treading a very fine line, and doing it quite adroitly.  Their interests are served, as I mentioned before, by Russia bleeding itself white.  They have no interest in arming Russia so that it conquers Ukraine (and in the process alienating the west).  At the same time, they have no interest in Russia's swift capitulation and remediation by the west.  

The ideal situation is for Russia to become a pariah in the west, to be weak and isolated, and to desperately need markets for its resources, and to invite China to make the necessary investment of capital to build overland pipelines for gas and oil. 

At the same time China also has ambitions in Taiwan, and the Russia/Ukraine conflict has similar surface area.  So China gets a preview of the western response to attempted conquest.  

China has significant interests in the conflict, but not to the extent that Ukraine is defeated.  I wouldn't worry about China entering.  I would however worry about China keeping things hot and hostile for a long time and draining the west's military resources so that there isn't anything in the cupboard when Taiwan's turn comes.",False,1679354180.0,t3_11w7xpq,t1_jd03e5g,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Bullets or projectiles containing either lead or depleted uranium are a more serious problems.  Depleted Uranium's tendency to spall is particularly problematic.  Small dust grains can blow around.  Uranium can become water soluble.  

The shells that do not explode (duds) are dangerous.  They will kill farmers or damage tractors long after the war.  Not much of an effect on food quality though.",False,1679348548.0,t3_11w7xpq,t1_jczatff,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

In the case of folks who grew up inundated with the failures of the Vietnam War, and the further failures of the US to cope with domestic discontent, it's not surprising that they've adopted an attitude of ""violence solves nothing, only negotiation does.""

https://www.aerosociety.com/news/ukraine-time-to-fast-track-front-line-fighter-pilot-training/

>Q: **How long is a western fighter pilots' training? And how short/abridged do you think a conversion course for Ukrainian pilots could be?**

>A: **Conversion to a front line combat aircraft for a new pilot would usually take about six months to become limited combat ready. However, a more experienced pilot would take less than half that time, and someone requalifying on type after a break would only take a few weeks.** If operational reasons demanded, then a much shorter course for experienced pilots learning a new type, focussed only on the relevant tactics and weapons, could be done in four to six weeks, much of which could be done on simulators.

-

>Q: What would be the best type to send them? MiG-29s from Poland/Slovakia would require minimal training, but give them parity, whereas surplus F-16s/18/F-15s could give them the edge? Could the UK's Tranche 1 Typhoons even be donated to give them overmatch - given they are set to be disposed of in a couple of years anyway? Or even surplus A-10s to take on Russian tanks?



>A: The more familiar the type the easier the conversion. However, **Western types are fairly user-friendly (especially the F- series) and relatively simple to grasp the basics. The stick, throttle and handling basics are simple transferable skills. Using the radar, avionics, weapons and defensive aids is the area of focus and teaching the basics of employment of those shouldn't take too long to achieve a level capable of matching or even overmatching the apparent poor Russian proficiency.**",False,1679321435.0,t3_11w7xpq,t1_jcxlta1,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

If you didn't catch it, housing was one of Bernie Sander's flagship issues during the 2019 campaign. He had a ""Housing-for-All"" plank. It called for reforming zoning rules to decrease NIMBYism, as well as 1.5 trillion investment fund to build affordable housing and mixed-use projects.

He also focused a lot on rent control stuff (caps on how fast you can raise rents and such) and other things, like increase in vouchers.

>\[Sanders\] sees the bad guys as landlords and speculators rather than the millions of more or less ordinary homeowners whose localized “not in my backyard” attitude to new construction is in fact the main impediment to creating abundant housing in America.  
>  
>Still, the fact that even a hardened market skeptic like Sanders is formally on board with the need for zoning reform and expansion of the housing supply is a real sign of how rapidly this topic has moved into the political mainstream — even as the candidate clearly seems more interested in going to war with technocrats over rent control.

It is reflected in an attack that either expends a force's morale or strength, or a maneuver that winds up disorganizing the layout of your formation. It means that you have no more reinforcements to throw into the battle and have effectively moved in the desired directions as far as you safely can.

You'll see this happen in fortified zones in HOI like the Maginot Line. The German AI will fanatically attack it for months and spend hundreds of thousands of manpower and equipment without much gain, ultimately destroying their stockpile of reserve equipment and attriting the overall average quality of their units in the army. A strategy for players is to let the German AI basically expend so much equipment and manpower attacking prepared fortifications that they halve their effective army power from losses, and then allow the player to waltz on in without much resistance.

You'll also see it after an armored spearhead, when your tanks have stretched as far as they can go through the gap in the enemy line, and now you have to wait for infantry to catch up before you can risk going any further. Your offensive has culminated because you do not have the unit resources on hand to continue advancing. If the enemy chooses to attack you at this time, you're stuck with what you have in the area.

> The proposal not to expand NATO eastward, which was one of the ways Western countries took the initiative on the issue of German reunification and reducing the possibility of the Soviet Union's influence on this process,[12] was based on the provisions of the speech of German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Tutzing, announced on January 31, 1990.[13] In it, the minister, among other things, called on NATO to unequivocally state: ""no matter what happens in the Warsaw Pact countries, there will be no expansion of NATO territory to the east, that is, closer to the borders of the Soviet Union.""[16][17] Genscher's speech was prepared by him without coordination with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to whom he was a political competitor on the eve of the upcoming parliamentary elections and from whom he sought to ""seize the laurels of the unifier of Germany"",[18] at the same time, his proposals aroused interest among the leadership of Western countries, which began to consider the possibility of obtaining the consent of the USSR to the unification of Germany in exchange to limit the expansion of NATO.[12] On February 2, the Minister outlined his plan to US Secretary of State James Baker,[12] and on February 6 — to British Foreign Minister Douglas Gird.[18] Genscher explained that the proposed restriction would be applicable to both the GDR and Eastern European countries.[12][18][19][20][21] 10 days after his speech in Tutzing, Genscher repeated his words in an interview with Shevardnadze: ""It is clear to us that membership in NATO creates difficult problems. However, one thing is clear to us: NATO will not expand to the east.""[22] Two days later, Genscher repeats the statement at a press conference with Baker in Washington: ""As I said, NATO has no intentions of expanding to the east.""[22]


>The American-West German position became the basis for negotiations on February 7–10, 1990 with the USSR,[12] which became key in the dispute over the existence of an agreement that followed years later.[12] During these negotiations, representatives of the United States and West Germany have repeatedly linked the unification of Germany with the limitation of NATO expansion.[23][24] **So, on February 9, 1990, at a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, James Baker stated that the United States was striving for a united Germany that would remain ""firmly tied to NATO,"" promising at the same time ""iron guarantees that NATO jurisdiction or forces would not move eastward.""[25] Later that day, at a meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, he acknowledged that ""It is important for the Soviet Union and other European countries to have guarantees that if the United States maintains its presence in Germany within the framework of NATO, there will be no extension of NATO's jurisdiction or military presence by a single inch in the eastern direction"". and, in addition, he asked Gorbachev whether he would prefer a united Germany ""outside NATO, completely independent, without American troops, or a united Germany that retains ties with NATO, but with a guarantee that, that the jurisdiction or NATO troops will not extend to the east of the current line.""** When Gorbachev replied that ""the expansion of the NATO zone is unacceptable,"" Baker agreed with this. In response, the head of the Soviet state told Baker that ""a lot of what you said seems realistic"" and urged him to ""think about it.""[12][26][27][28] Baker, at a press conference in Moscow on the same day, made public the resulting exchange, saying that the United States proposed, in order to mitigate the concerns of ""those who are east of Germany,""[29][12] to prevent the expansion of NATO forces in the eastern direction and stated that the unification of Germany, according to the US position, is hardly possible without ""certain security guarantees"" with regard to the advance of NATO forces or its operation to the east.[29] Later, in its February 13 press release sent to embassies, the US State Department indicated that ""the Secretary of State made it clear that the US supports a united Germany in NATO, but is ready to ensure that NATO's military presence will not expand further to the east.""[30][12]

China, like Ruzzia, is a deeply corrupted country. There are some things in China you can't do without bribing someone, and I'm talking like basic administrative things.

Let me elaborate with an example - I wonder, if China were to invade Taiwan (which has a plurality to majority of support from mainland Chinese by all credible accounts), would people bring out the racist stereotypes? Surely the Chinese genocide of the Uyghurs and Tibetans would justify being racist towards them in return. And this isn't outlandish, since the CCP is already attacking [Canadian](https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/canada-to-probe-alleged-chinese-election-interference/ar-AA18j5UR) and [Australian](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-11/china-accused-attempt-bankroll-labor-candidates-federal-election/100822512) democratic institutions. Protecting yourself is not racism, as you said.

So then, I'm ethnically Chinese, but I was born in Canada and detest the CCP. Where would I fall in this scenario? I would suffer the consequences of the decisions of a government that I did not support, just because of the colour of my skin and my ancestry. I don't think that would be fair at all.

If you think that this is a ridiculous comparison to Russians and the war in Ukraine, where do you draw the line for Russians, then? Are Russian Americans and Canadians included in this as well? Some older ethnic Russians especially are sympathetic to their Motherland. How about Russians that were raised in the Soviet Union, who then moved out later and have established new lives in other countries?  ""I only mean those who have fled since the invasion began, and who actually support the war."" There's no easy way to tell and the line is far less distinct then you may think. For instance, what about Russians who had family outside Russia and have moved in accordance to this?

The point is, just as it is harmful to assume all Chinese people are trying to undermine democracy in Western countries, it's unfair to assume all emigrant Russians, or ethnic Russians overseas, are in support of the war.
