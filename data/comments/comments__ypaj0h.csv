Day 258 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a very quiet day with no missile strikes or drones. Nothing much happened in general, we didn’t even have any air raid alerts since 5am, which is pretty unusual. It’s very rare that there are so few air raid alerts in a day, but not hearing a new siren every few hours does feel good.

Sometimes you even forget that there’s a war happening in the first place, because right now there’s a ton of people everywhere outside. Every supermarket/store is full of people during every hour of the day, and there are a lot of kids on the streets everywhere, almost as many as before the war. I would say that, from our observations, about 70-80% of the people that fled from Kharkiv after the war started have already returned.

All the destruction in the city, and the fact that there are no street lights, does always remind you that the war still continues, but still, the city feels extremely lively despite all that. Everyday all the bus/tram stops are full of people going to work at 6am, just like it was before the war. Everyone simply got used to war and now it doesn’t seem like something out of the ordinary, which is honestly pretty weird. You would think that you can’t get used to something as horrific as war, especially one as barbaric as this one, but you absolutely can, it just happens naturally, without even realizing it.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 08 November 2022
 

- Russia has started constructing defensive structures around the occupied southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Two plants are producing concrete pyramidal anti-tank structures, known as dragon's teeth, for this purpose.

- Dragon's teeth have likely been installed between Mariupol and Nikolske village; and from northern Mariupol to Staryi Krym village. Mariupol forms part of Russia's land bridge' from Russia to Crimea, a key logistics line of communication. Dragon's teeth have additionally been sent for the preparation of defensive fortifications in occupied Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

- Russia is fortifying its lines throughout areas of occupation. On 19 October 2022, Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed the construction of a fortified 'Wagner Line of defences in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. This activity suggests Russia is making a significant effort to prepare defences in depth behind their current front line, likely to forestall any rapid Ukrainian advances in the event of breakthroughs.",False,1667895504.0,t3_ypaj0h,t3_ypaj0h,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

>Launcher vehicles are packed with MBDA Aster 30 missiles. The Aster 30 is a two-stage missile. The booster steers the missile in the direction of the target. It separates a few seconds after launch. Due to its two-stage layout the missile can reach a speed of Mach 4.5 within 2.5 seconds. Furthermore he missile is highly maneuverable. Up to its mid-course the missile is guided using refreshed target data transmitted by the multi-function radar. During the homing phase the missile is guided by its electromagnetically active seeker. This seeker was originally developed to defeat stealthy cruise missiles. The Aster 30 missie is that accurate, that in 70% of the test firings it managed to ram the target. Although direct hits are not essential to achieve a kill, as this missile also has a small explosive warhead.

First is ""Presidential Drawdown Authority"" (PDA). This is equipment provided directly from US military stockpiles and is normally of a pretty limited cash value per year. It requires no special Congressional approval, although Congress has put several temporary expansions on it for Ukraine. In this case, the President gets to pick and choose what is sent, obviously with Ukrainian input though.

Second are the various Congressional aid packages. These are done from Congress and may include expansion of the PDA above. These can be anything from cash to help keep the Ukraine government functioning, ""gift cards"" for US military industry (Ukraine gets more say in what they get within reason), other non-military aid, or whatever else Congress wants.

Finally there is Lend-Lease. This lets Ukraine make orders from US military industry and pay for it after the war (or return it to the US). In WWII, the payments at the end of the war were given massive discounts, it would likely be the same here. These transactions are not immediate (it takes time to build a vehicle, spin up ammo factory production, etc) and are also private, they are not announced publicly.

I'd like to believe they'll try to surround Kherson and not enter the city unless it's absolutely necessary (Russians would try to flatten it with artillery and turn it into an urban slog), also secure the dam at Nova Kakhovka before it can potentially be blown, then create a pocket to expand a bridge head on the left bank of the Dnipro crossing at the dam, then spearhead to Melitopol from that direction as I'm going to bet Russia didn't fortify that approach as much, then retake Crimea once land bridge supplies are being strangled, then finish off the Donbas fight.

If they can secure a big enough pocket on the other side of the Dnipro, then it could turn into another Kharkiv breakout.

59a5a035a4a82d3294a24a7dba754ace,ypaj0h,ivmgumh,"The russian forces inside of Ukraine need supplies and reinforcements to keep fighting. They can get that easily through main general land corridors - bridge into Crimea, and the rail lines down from the north through Lukashank Oblast. To win, Ukraine basically needs to block both those supply line routes, and eventually concentrate force to take back Crimea. The russian forces, if they are planning to pull back, seem intent on scorched earth tactics as they retreat, things like sinking all the civilian boats and whatnot really don't help militarily, but they do make it less livible in the area. So Ukraine kind of has a time window to where they can punch a hole through either of those areas, the longer they wait the better prepared the russian positions are, but as it gets closer to winter, the lack of preparation is going to kill a bunch of those unprepared conscripts that were sent down too, so time really probably favors Ukraine. If Ukraine can leverage a big enough force to punch through Kherson or up north and penetrate deep inside russian lines, they can theoretically cut off large portions of the russian troops from escape or resupply. Air resupply is basically suicide with the number of anti air platforms in Ukraine at the moment, and Russia has no real air dropped supply capacity (or even pallet technology, which I still find hilarious) to rapidly drop supplies even if they wanted to risk a cargo aircraft. 

If Ukraine can capture the west bank of the Dnepo (sp?) river, and build a beachhead, they will start moving troops and heavy weapons over immidiatly and try and make a larger pocket to bring over more supplies and troops and equipment. There is risk though, the Russians know they are coming, they may be crazy enough to blow the hydroelectric dam and try and wash away a landing party once enough troops are there, etc. Ukraine on the other hand doesn't have large landing craft to try and attempt a landing on the coast and away from the contested areas, so they don't have alot of geographically feasible options. 

I see them keeping a holding force at one or the other front, and trying to sneakily reinforce one or the other long enough to create a decisive force large enough to take a large chunk of territory. I think the more noise they make about an imminent attack is the least likely vector it will come from.

They've been sold all over the world and been around for decades, it's inevitable that any country that really wanted to get a look at one already has. The Stinger hasn't changed that much in capability in a couple decades and sure seeing the newest version of Javelin might give them a tip or two but it's nothing they haven't seen before. They might not have gotten their hands on an NLAW yet but even though it's warhead operates differently than a Javelins it's not the end of the world.

Sure analyzing the warheads will help with knowing just how much armor you might need to defend against it. You might even pick a up a few tips on jamming them but none of those weapons are doing anything that is some great leap forward in tech. In fact one of the things that makes the NLAW so much cheaper than Javelin missile is that it uses a lot of ""off the shelf"" parts that are available commercially to reduce cost. The capabilities of all those systems are already pretty well known too.

Plus having one doesn't suddenly mean that Iran can start manufacturing them, they could never hope to get all the parts in quantity because of sanctions and there would still be some proprietary computer chips in there they would have no way to make or buy anyway.

So sure it's always handy to get a look at your enemies weapons but these types of shoulder fired weapons are pretty ubiquitous, I wouldn't worry that much.",False,1667965879.0,t3_ypaj0h,t1_ivn1bqf,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Early in the conflict they weren't using air defense well at all, which is why those drones were able to get in and do work so well. They couldn't defend their push towards Kyiv due to their ineptitude.

NOW, with Russian systems getting destroyed by SEAD attacks (Suppresion of Enemy Air Defense - basically firing radar-seeking missiles when an aircraft gets pinged by enemy radar) maybe we'll see more of them, but the difficulty comes from the range they're able to operate at. S-300 can go out to like 93 miles.

Here's my guess: Ukraine has been working on longer range missiles and drones that they should be able to deploy by year's end. Assuming Russian incompetence and logistical issues, they're not moving their S-300s very much (as much to save fuel as anything else).

The complex first came to public attention in 2010 after whistleblower Sergei Kolesnikov published an open letter to Russian president Dmitry Medvedev exposing the construction of the palace. Kolesnikov also stated that the undertaking was run by Nikolai Shamalov who was acting on behalf of Vladimir Putin. Alexander Ponomarenko was later reported to have ownership.

While the US is definitely the biggest provider of aid by dollar value, I think it is worth mentioning the efforts of various other countries. It is really hard to put a dollar value on some things, like intelligence analysis or housing refugees.

(The following is from memory, feel free to post comments adding or correcting me)

The EU has been providing a huge amount of cash to help keep Ukraine's government functioning. Just because there is a war on doesn't mean the teachers stop needing paychecks.

Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia have provided huge numbers of their Soviet era equipment to Ukraine. At this point, easily half of Ukraine's forces are driving a tank that wasn't in Ukraine at the beginning of 2022, same with conventional or rocket artillery.

Poland, Slovakia, and Bulgaria are providing vehicle repair services for Ukraine. This is highly necessary as the proper tank factories in Ukraine have a habit of getting hit by missiles on the occasion that Russia actually hits a military target.

New Zealand offered to take the night shift of intelligence analysis for Ukraine. The US/NATO is likely feeding all sorts of intelligence data to Ukraine. You can see the drones and ELINT planes on FlightRADAR24 just outside the borders and on the Black Sea.

Many countries are providing training to some extent or another to Ukraine, including the US, UK, and various other NATO members. This ranges from technical training, to first aid training, to the UK's ""give us 10,000 recruits, we'll return them clothed, equipped, and trained.""

Private companies also were known to step up. Back in February, Remington and Winchester were racing to the US State department to see who could get a million rounds of ammo to Ukraine first. Don't be fooled by Elon though, the US paid for everything he offered through money provided by Congress.

Edit:

Oh yeah, Poland has been building warehouses and other transport infrastructure near the Ukraine border to facilitate better movement of supplies into Ukraine. They have also proposed a joint repair and refurbishment base, although it is unclear how much other countries have taken them up on it.1",1667887870.0,1667887225.0,t3_ypaj0h,t1_ivilpi1,,2,33,0,33,0,0,

 >A graphite bomb is intended to be a non-lethal weapon used to disable an electrical grid. The bomb works by spreading a dense cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over air-insulated high voltage installations like transformers and power lines, causing short-circuits and subsequent disruption of the electricity supply in an area, a region or even an entire small country. The weapon is sometimes referred to as blackout bomb or as soft bomb because its direct effects are largely confined to the targeted electrical power facility, with minimal risk of immediate collateral damage.

Naval weapons are in a whole different level to army weapons, especially with respect to recoil, a 155 mm howitzer has to be dug in and braced, a 5 inch cannon (roughly 1 inch smaller than 155 mm howitzer) is anchored to a ship that's between 3,000 and 6,000 tons and has an attached magazine and autoloader.  Point defense weapons are the same, plus don't have to worry about rounds landing on civilians, so their engagement envelopes can go from sea level to max elevation at full firing speed.

Futhermore, right now ships have issues with drone swarms because they are restricted from just opening fire on detection of the drones, if they had to they could open uas soon as they detected them. Provided the equipment is functional and the crews are properly trained. (Which doesn't bode well for the US Pacific fleet given their recent track record)
