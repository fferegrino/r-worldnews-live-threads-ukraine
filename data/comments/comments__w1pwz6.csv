Day 145 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was very quiet almost the entire day, we didn’t get shelled even once, and for the second day in a row they didn’t fire any missiles at Kharkiv. Those extremely loud explosions from yesterday actually turned out to be shelling, but it is still pretty strange that they didn’t create any shockwaves, we are only 2-3km away from the place that was shelled and we barely felt this it, other than the sound.

They only fired 2 missiles today, and none of them were aimed at our city, they landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, but we don’t know where yet. They decreased the number of missiles they fire per day drastically, and to substitute those additional missiles they started to also shell places they send their missiles to. Though this is only the second day in a row that they did this, it might be their strategy going forward. 

At first, about 1.5 months ago, they were firing 6-8 missiles per day, after a month they reduced that number to 4, and now it’s just 2 missiles at a time, accompanied by artillery barrage. But we still need more time to see if they will continue to fire just 2 missiles per day. They are definitely conserving their missiles now, and just a month or so ago they were bragging about still having a lot of missiles left, guess it’s different now.",False,1658197441.0,t3_w1pwz6,t3_w1pwz6,,0,97,0,97,2,0,

🪖 This weekend, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  There were a lot of battles and shelling and you can get all the little details from [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1548835214390185986), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1548614154545659904.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1548847371106369536.html).  The gist is russia is trying, and failing, to advance in the Donbas and Ukraine is trying, and [succeeding](https://twitter.com/ThomasHemberge1/status/1548408275275620352), to advance towards Kherson.

🍄 This weekend Ukraine continued to use HIMARS to target russian ammo dumps, military bases, and command posts. This is having a [large effect](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1548684752135364608) as russia is pulling their ammo dumps [farther away](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1548329107477381120) from the front, making it harder to keep their artillery supplied.  I did find a [pretty good video](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1548412311374741512) -- not a HIMARS though I think.

👉 russia's ""military pause"" [was lifted](https://twitter.com/swflwarrior/status/1548252416931287040) this weekend as Russia's Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu instructed the army to advance ""on all fronts"".  Most observers noted that it wasn't much of a pause as russia kept (trying) to attack all week, and not much changed after the order.   The Institute for the Study of War concluded the order meant a [new attempt on Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1548466320152309762)

👉 Up to 500,000 Ukrainians are [expected to take refuge](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1548837264368738304) in Europe this winter, escaping a lack of housing, electricity and gas.

👉 Liza, the 4 year old downs syndrome girl who was killed by a russian missile attack in Vinnytsia was [laid to rest](https://twitter.com/AP/status/1548672638230355971) on Sunday.  Just more [russian warcrimes](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1548704887906701314.html) to add to the outrageous pile.  In my initial report on this I stated that Liza's mother had died as well, fortunately this [was incorrect](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1548316153084227585).

👉 A [Ukrainian owned cargo plane](https://twitter.com/Jake_Hanrahan/status/1548608771907256320) flying from Serbia to Jordan carrying weapons to Bangladesh, [crashed](https://twitter.com/markito0171/status/1548424192927797248) outside of Greece on Sunday.  Quite a lot of incorrect social media activity on this one.  I'm including this non-war related item here in case you stumble across one of the fake news posts in your twitter journeys.

💰 russia is aiding sanctions by voluntarily disconnecting itself from the [SWIFT banking system](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1548594046838398978) -- Still waiting for a reliable source for that, but I'd say it's a medium confidence statement.  Additionally Aeroflot, the russian airline, is [laying off many](https://twitter.com/jason_corcoran/status/1548581689907187712) of its flight attendants.

👉 russia has relocated a significant number of ships from Sevastopol to their [other naval base in the black sea](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1548767617535672323), Novorossiysk -- notably outside the 300km ATACMS range of HIMARS and M270s.

👉 Ukrain President Zelensky has fired his longtime personal friend and head of the Security Service of Ukraine [Ivan Bakanov](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/1548747253241765888) citing negligence leading to deaths.  President Zelensky also [fired Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1548756964842393600) using his war-time powers.  It was Venediktova who pressured the Kyiv Post that led to the firing of its reporters who later formed the Kyiv Independent who reported on the firing in the last link.

👉 russia is having all kinds of trouble stealing Ukraine's crops in the occupied territories.  First russia stole all the farm equipment and sent them back to russia, now Ukrainians are [setting fires to their fields](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1548742787096510465) to keep russia from using their produce to finance the war.

👉 A 19 year old Ukrainian conscript has [shot down his 6th](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1548709672504500227) enemy plane with a MANPAD since the war began, this time a SU-25.

Currently russia has [no clear war objectives](https://twitter.com/A_Melikishvili/status/1546420948194234370) and has been [shrinking its stated objectives](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1547375127272235010) since its retreat from Kyiv.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 18 July 2022
 


- Russia has used private military company Wagner to reinforce front-line forces and to mitigate manning shortfalls and casualties. Wagner has almost certainly played a central role in recent fighting, including the capture of Popasna and Lysyschansk. This fighting has inflicted heavy casualties on the group.

- Wagner are lowering recruitment standards, hiring convicts and formerly blacklisted individuals. Very limited training is made available to new recruits. This will highly likely impact on the future operational effectiveness of the group and will reduce its value as a prop to the regular Russian forces.

- Wagner head, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, has recently been made a Hero of the Russian Federation for Wagner's performance in Luhansk. This, at a time when a number of very senior Russian military commanders are being replaced, is likely to exacerbate grievances between the military and Wagner. It is also likely to impact negatively on Russian military morale.

I don't think it will; in fact, I think when held at gunpoint like this, people rally together against the aggressor and show resilience and sacrifice of which he simply has no understanding or even ability to grasp.

It is for this reason that he so spectacularly underestimated Ukraine, and the same will be true with his economic aggression toward the E.U. too.

But rather than just me speculating, perhaps we can prove it.  Perhaps, collectively, we could show the strength of our support through action.  Imagine if individuals and businesses across Europe were to commit to lowering their gas consumption, perhaps even commit to zero gas usage on pre-agreed ""no gas day""s—the number and/or frequency of these days could start small and build up over time.  Consequences would include:

* alleviating shortages
* (further) encouraging exploration of alternatives
* building a sense of solidarity
* signalling strength of support
* reducing CO2 emissions
* saving money!

For example, both the space and water within my home are heated by gas; I also have a gas cooker.  Even in the height of winter it would be trivial for me to, say one day a week: switch off the heating, skip a shower/wash with a flannel and cold water, and use the electric oven or microwave.  Frankly I could do this every other day of the week without much difficulty.

Of course I appreciate that my experience will not be the same as everyone else's.  Plenty of people already use the minimum they can, perhaps because they're more budget or environmentally conscious than me.  And some industries may struggle to make significant reductions without considerable operational impact.  But nevertheless the collective effect could be huge.

Either Russian leadership is in plain denial of their lack current operational capabilities, this could be a possibility given their failures at the start of the war or they have few aces up their sleeves they are keeping for the next weeks months.

I don't give the second theory much credit though. Time helps the defenders more than it helps the attackers as Ukraine is enlisting much more servicemen than Russians are and they are going through longer trainings.

It will be very interesting to see how the next months will go, but everything seems to point out that we're heading for a major stall with neither of the two forces being really able to undertake major offensives, but I could be wrong here because we don't get any intel or info about Ukrainian numbers involved in the war.

After summer, countries replenish their storage when consumption is low. I'm guessing energy is consumed faster than it is replenished. Otherwise they'd be able to keep storage high all year.

So if you want to cause maximum havoc, you prevent the storage to get filled before winter. Because when the gas will be needed, the storage will be either empty or almost empty.

So what Russia did was to slow down replenishment rate by 60%. So storage doesn't get filled as fast or possibly barely filled because if you're filling at 40%. Let say 80% of what you'd usually get gets in the storage and 20% is consumed right away. Then currently only 20% would get in the storage. 

But hey, you're in the middle of the summer so things are ""fine"" and you can technically fill enough for winter maybe. So you stop the gas completely on ""scheduled"" repair. So while it's not working, storage will get consumed.

Now the important part. You have to stop the gas long enough that even if it was replenishing at 100% speed. It would not be able to fill the storage enough to last the whole winter. Remember there was a report that Germany could last for 2 and half month using their storage?

Well make sure that in November, they don't have enough storage to last until January. The idea is that you have to give them enough resources to not screw them but not enough that they can screw you. If they were to stop the gas today without opening it, then Europe would have 0 reasons to hope for a diplomatic solutions. But if you keep the gas flowing, then at some point you'll have the chance to turn the gas off in a way to make maximum harm at the time it will hurt the most. And this will be used to make Europe submit itself to Russia when gas storage reaches 0.

But that's the story, and the reality is that Russian strategy is flawed because Europe isn't dependent at 100% on gas. And Russia doesn't have monopoly in Europe. It can be enough to be scary, but I doubt Europe would submit itself to Russia's demand over energy requirements.

Archaeology is often an under count since strangulation, slit throats, and gut wounds do not show up on skeletons.  Infected cuts/punctures and burns only show up if the cut was deep and hit bone.  Fire damage is usually assumed to be attempted cremation or an accident. So really 22% of people getting smashed skulls or dismembered by stone axe.

He's now a well known figure across all of Europe, a leader people have heard of, respect, and pay attention to. He'd be far more than just a ""martyr to the cause"" if he was killed.

The death of a significant European leader at the hands of Russia would not be something other nations could or would ignore. At a **minimum**, I would anticipate it being the casus belli for Poland and likely the Baltics to declare war on Russia, as it would put their countries under direct threat if Russia could assassinate leaders with impunity. At a *maximum*, all out war with NATO wouldn't be off the table.

The question then is what Russia might gain by killing him. The only argument here is that he's a fantastic negotiator, an inspiring speaker, a uniting figure for Ukraine, and very good at deferring tasks and roles to those with the right skills and expertise - particularly on the military side of things, where Putin in traditional Russian style is far more ""hands on"".

The first would be trying to nail down more of the territory in Luhansk and Donetsk to solidify their claims over the territory.   We can expect a more offensive-minded posture, and they'll try to reduce the casualty and equipment loss rates with heavier artillery dependence and concentrated aerial bombardment and tactical strikes.   That means the offensive moves for a short period will be in the form of smaller probing attacks, looking for weaknesses in the now-straightened lines of Ukrainian defense.  The holding actions in Sieverdonetsk and Popasna bought the Ukrainians time to build up the defensive fortifications across the lines they occupy now, so that will be a challenge to the Russian offensive.

The other would be holding the Crimean 'land bridge' from Melitopol to Kherson.  With partisan activity stepping up, as well as the counteroffensive actions being performed by the Ukrainians around Kherson, this reshuffle will be along defensive lines.   With Zaporzhiza being a fairly quiet front, I imagine much of the action being taken around the easternmost part of that bridge to be in special operations/partisan activity, and the Russians doing their best to suppress that.

The major models you'll hear about:

T-62 - the oldest tanks in this war. Small gun and questionable armor; but better than nothing.

T-64 - You'll mostly hear about these on the Ukraine side, but might see some in Russian hands. A big upgrade over the T-62, but delays in production meant that they didn't get made in big numbers.

T-72 - Similar to the T-64, but fixed the production issues.

T-80 - An incremental upgrade on the T-72 (edit: as I keep getting commented at, it has a turbine engine like the Abrams. Some people find this very important. Depending on the upgrade package, this may have been switched back to a normal engine.)

T-90 - A T-80, mostly meant for export to other countries, but some got bought by Russia proper. Still mostly a T-72 with small upgrades

Except this was never the case: natural gas has always been one of the most expensive options for electricity generation. Ironically enough, Western Europe (with the exception of France, which went all-in on nuclear) switched to natural gas in the 1970s and 80s mostly for energy independence (there were significant reserves in the North Sea) and because it was cleaner than coal (people tend to forget that European woodlands were dying to acid rain at the time). Russian gas became increasingly significant in the mix as the North Sea reserves gradually exhausted. By the 2000s, the big push towards (by now almost exclusively Russian) gas came, quite ironically enough, from its complementary character with renewable energy sources like solar and wind: gas-fired power plants are comparatively cheap to build (they are essentially modified jet engines) and have fast reaction times that allow them to quickly spring into action when cheaper ""baseline"" energy sources, such as renewables, cannot cope with demand. Adding to this their comparatively low carbon emissions (burning a molecule of methane produces two molecules of water and just one of carbon dioxide) explains how gas was seen as the perfect complement to wind and solar. And for purely geographic reasons, once the North Sea reserves were depleted, Russia was the obvious source for that gas (and not just for Western Europe: Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, is even more heavily dependent on Russian gas).

Russia's autocratic, aggressive turn upends all those green calculations, and rather than promoting green energy sources, the current situation is leading to mothballed coal plants and mines being brought back into action. Not even nuclear power can reliably bridge the gap: because of the current heatwave, French nuclear power stations are running at minimum power levels, since they cannot otherwise be reliably cooled (authorities have even had to temporarily derogate the max. temperature limits for the cooling water they return to rivers).

f7b25f8857cb46a55aa441a4fa73bd31,w1pwz6,igq1uil,"The truth?

...Probably not as much as we'd think.

The HIMARS and M270 can switch out ammo in basically 5 minutes with the rocket pod design. Russian launchers are at least double that reload time, but the last I read was something like 10-20 minutes. I don't know why this block unit design isn't more popular when it clearly works, while being much more logistically simple. You could argue the Russian way offers flexibility with rocket types (you could put in different, alternating rounds for more specialized effects), but...you could just do that with a rocket pod design (EDIT: On second thought, this probably isn't feasible; different rockets have different ballistic characteristics depending on the warhead weight; unless your rockets are already designed with that in mind, such a functionality probably wouldn't be there. In which case, I'm curious of the reasons this design simply isn't more popular).

So, for an equivalent caliber and rocket load, 2 of Russia's launchers are worth one HIMARS or M270, if not more, in terms of throughput of rockets.

So, to launch the same amount of ammo in the same amount of time, Ukraine only needs half as many launchers as Russia would, if not less.

Thus, ammunition is the real bottleneck here; they only need as many launchers as they're getting ammo.

Right now? Honestly, I think that around 30-40 HIMARS, shooting and scooting with a healthy supply of energy drinks for the crews, would probably be the ideal count for systems running actively in the field with the conditions they're under, with some more in reserve as any break down or get lost or become combat losses (none recorded so far, but...no system is invulnerable).

What about if they get the ATACMS or other even longer range rockets?

Well, if they get those...a lot of the same will still apply because they'll be striking even deeper targets, but after getting all those in another bumrush...yeah, they can eventually find a comfy place hundreds of kilometers back to sling fire from without much fear of reprisal from the majority of Russian heavy weapons systems, especially if covered by air defense systems.",1658196553.0,1658195646.0,t3_w1pwz6,t1_igpve3l,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Comparing 70's natural gas grids to current gas grids might be comparing apples to pears as for gas, the costs of transport can be extremely significant for the overall costs and in the 70's the gas network was still poorly developed.

Also coal is indeed being used, but this is also because coal infrastructure is already in place and we currently have an acute problem and there aren't many other options.

Also the costs of co2 emission tax has gone x10 in 10 years time as [stated here](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/carbon), and will be under pressure more and more as less permits will be present every year, so I very much doubt that coal will be used after this acute shock, also for EU emission reduction reasons.

European economies are highly paying for the war already and helping Ukraine is not popular in several countries (in Italy and Spain supporting Ukraine financially and with weapons isn't popular, most of the populations oppose it). 

As winter kicks in the gas blackmailing may create a pressure for European leaders to push Ukraine for a ceasefire. With a ceasefire temporal gains may become permanent for Russia, any offensive by Ukraine will piss off the leaders that brokered the ceasefire and may lose Ukraine support. This will allow Russia to regroup, analyze what's happened and mount another offensive months or years from now.

Thus, it is crucial that before winter Ukraine displays the ability to retake some major part of their country (e.g. Kherson). Otherwise the countries that support Ukraine now may lose trust in Ukraine's ability to win the war.

While Putin has met a rather uniform political response from European leaders he still has the weapons of propaganda, journalists and all the parties he has funded for years through Russian banks to change public opinion towards the conflict.

Less than 1%, but my point is that it's still an option you can't ignore. I don't see it going strategic nuclear, but I can see it getting pretty close. I would not rule out low-yield tactical use.

For example, if Poland and/or the Baltics send in peacekeeper type forces to push Russia out, in response most likely Russia launches missiles against targets in any of these nations which include shared NATO bases... where uninvolved NATO assets are then hit. That's a possible pathway to escalation. Likely? No, because NATO units were in Ukraine until early Feb and got the hell out of Dodge when things looked to be turning South. However, even if Poland for example went on the offensive (and therefore moved out from under the NATO nuclear umbrella), I don't see a NATO drawdown from Polish soil happening in the same way because, well, it's still a NATO member and has strategically necessary locations for other members too.

Looking at the historic *Seven Days to the River Rhine* plans drawn up by the Warsaw Pact and the NATO *Reforger* defensive plans, which given how little Russia's doctrine has changed, are not a bad starting point for the uninitiated - it's worth noting that these included pre-emptive strikes by Russia (well, the USSR) on nations *not* immediately drawn into such a conflict to prevent reinforcement or the establishment of alternative staging locations. Again, Russia is *likely* to be more reserved than this, especially if provoking NATO is not a guarantee, but we've seen how incompetent they are, and it's not always easy to retarget missiles. We'd be headed for substantial escalation and ramping up on both sides, with lots of twitchy fingers.

Likewise, if NATO AIRCOM detects incoming missiles fired by Russia, they aren't waiting around to find out exactly where they're aimed or if they're nuclear tipped, everything moves into ""transition to War"" and the US forces in the region are at DEFCON 2, at a minimum.

The assassination of a world leader not in NATO would usually have no effect on NATO, except that Ukraine is specifically a NATO partner and was on the pathway to both NATO and EU membership when this happened. It's officially an EU candidate now as well. A very different place to where it was on Feb 24.

The *likely* outcome of an assassination on Zelensky though is way more likely to be:

1. Deployment of Polish forces into Ukraine within 24 hours.

2. Rapid collapse of Russian units at least as far back as the border within a week.

3. A coup or other fall of the Putin government, most likely to its own disillusioned military or through a breakup as various federal subjects declare independence from Moscow.

4. Unconditional surrender of Russia to Ukraine within a month.

4. Peace is brokered and Russia, if not already broken apart, is declawed by a neutral multi-state intergovernmental organisation, possibly the UN, possibly a NATO/CIS/China coalition as they all have interests they want to protect.",False,1658164072.0,t3_w1pwz6,t1_igmfm8r,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

HIMARS is one of the most cost effective ways to do that at the front. 8 launchers hitting their 8 targets consistently with complete logistics chains is far better than risking air-strikes in contested airspace, or overinvesting in massive artillery formations that would not be able to all operate at as high a readiness (be it from waiting for resup, crew rest etc.) as a smaller number of optimised systems with crew and maintainence rotations on the go 24/7. Do more, more efficiently, with less.

Frankly, I think saturation bombardments and WWI style shelling to 'soften up' targets have gone the way of the dodo. Russia runs saturation strikes on dug-in positions, which as history shows, will not dislodge a dug-in defender with overhead protection and with sufficient manpower to absorb the odd casualty.

I think the digital age has dramatically altered the nature of putting munitions on target. Not having high accuracy or guided munitions is just a waste of industrial resources in the 21st century.

We are already seeing this in the Asia-Pacific region with A2/AD assets to strike ships - because why risk aircrews (with very lengthy training requirements) and very expensive planes and ships when a flurry of more cost-effective guided anti-shipping missiles can do it more effectively from safety which preserves precious trained and specialised manpower?

What no one is talking about is the [NGAD fighter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_Air_Dominance) the US just developed in record time using digital engineering and manufacturing techniques. They basically design the entire plane and manufacturing line digitally and then test the entire system using supercomputers to simulate production and indentify choke points, failures, and other issues that normally would not arise until you start production. 

This fighter is already flying and prototypes being produced in small quantities. This will be the first pilot optional fighter and will have a host of AI and networking features that will basically allow the US to neuter China or Russia remotely without risking many, if any, US lives. This program is also being developed in conjunction with a Loyal Wingman drone that will basically screen the incoming fighters and allow pilots to track, indentify, and destroy targets with over the horizon munitions fired from drones that are screening the manned aircraft dozens or even hundreds of miles ahead. 

If the US ramped production of NGAD, loyal wingman, and B-21 Raider in response to a really near-peer threat, Russia or China would be totally fucked as an Orwellian swarm of AI enabled drones destroys their entire air force and air defense system from out of sight. Basically the concept is to eventually fight wars like a bunch of neckbeards aying COD in their Mom's basement.

For instance in Germany their industry uses a lot of electricity made with natural gas, as does the electric grid in general, switching everyone to electric heaters doesn't help that much if a bunch of the electricity comes from natural gas fired power plants anyway. I am sure many other countries in Europe have similar issues with where their power comes from.

Also when gas is a common source for home heating in a country you're not going to have the available workforce to replace the heating system in literally millions of properties in 4 to 5 months. You need skilled trades people to uninstall gas lines and the furnace and to install electric baseboard heaters in every room. There simply isn't enough labor available to do it in that short a time frame. Plus there would not be the supply of electric heaters to refit that many homes in time, it's not like manufacturers have been sitting on a ton of excess capacity just in case millions of homes in Europe suddenly wanted to switch heating sources.

So it's simply not going to happen by winter even if money was no object.

They should of course start making long term plans to convert homes where practical and do other things like making liquified natural gas terminals to get away from dependence on Russia that they've started on.

The true issue, IMO, is a different part of logistics: carrying capacity. The Abrams is a much heavier (in weight) tank than the Ukrainians are used to dealing with.

>Last week [May, 2003], a Greek news magazine, Krama, reported that the Turkish plane was hit during a [mock] dogfight between Greek and Turkish planes. The Greek pilot reportedly fired an air-to-air missile by mistakenly pressing his trigger button for too long while registering that he had got the better of his Turkish rival.

I'd argue that since the nineties Russia reliance has only increased therefore it could easily be the opposite.

IDK, it just seems almost masochistic to submit a single basic opinion that obviously won't be received well, and then to take absolutely no interest in defending your position beyond a name drop that I had to practically wrangle out of you. Why did you post the original comment? Just to get downvoted while you refuse to explain? How else did you see that going?

But yes, just for the record, and because I'd hate for some crappy theory to gain traction without proper explanation, I think you're wrong. I think you're attempt at ""reading through the lines"" is one-sighted and has resulted in a narrative that ignores a whole laundry list of potential and actual pitfalls of the Russian military and the BRICS alliance. I think suggesting that the Russian military hasn't been decimated is questionable at best-- are you taking that as like a literal 10% and that's the confusion? Because it seems obvious that they have generally underperformed, took a massive beating in the original attack on Kyiv, and reduced the scope of their goals again, and again, and again only to finally make grinding, small, and un-strategic gains that are even now coming to a halt. 

And while I don't particularly want to be mean or disrespectful about it, I also can't help but think that narrative is as potentially damaging as it is wrong, so I'm just laying that out. And maybe don't play the victim card right after a condescending comment like this:

S-400, S-350, and S-500 being fielded are absolutely factors in 5V55 reaching end of life and usefulness.  You don't need to put S-500 in Ukraine for 5V55 to be useless.

Important questions to ask about 5V55:

* Is it likely to have any effectiveness in its original intended role (anti-air)? (no)
* Will Russia have any platforms that can fire it in 5 years? (probably not)
* Since it is past design life, is it likely to even work a few years from now if Russia has launchers? (no)

So, burning 5V55 on ground attack is finding the most useful thing to do with them. 

> I'd argue that since the nineties Russia reliance has only increased therefore it could easily be the opposite.

The point is, 9M96 does not heavily use western components in its design, due to it being designed before reliance increased.

Apart from freeing up other systems then I don't really see it to be honest. Its use may be diminished but its better then nothing right? Because if you don't ability to replace them with newer systems they still are effectively useful to you. Russia's systems inventory is at its peak or was 6 months ago.

> So, burning 5V55 on ground attack is finding the most useful thing to do with them

Or its the least valuable missile type and such when you have limited other options thats what you'd use if you have to.

It started in the nineties. Much like other industries in Russia its opening up and engagement with globalisation changed its relationship with reliance on the West.",1658202884.0,1658202605.0,t3_w1pwz6,t1_igqfw8v,,2,1,0,1,0,0,
