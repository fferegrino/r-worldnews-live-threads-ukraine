Day 173 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was a lot of shelling, much more than usual. We were shelled at least 3 times, at 10am Saltivka district was shelled, in that shelling a roof of an apartment complex, a children playground and some garages were hit, 7 people were injured and 1 person died. Is playground a military target? Russia sure does seem to think so. It‚Äôs one of their top priority targets alongside with schools.
 
It‚Äôs a good thing that there were no people there at the time, because despite frontline being just 15-20km away from our city, there are still tons of children on playgrounds during the day. The one just in front of my apartment building is basically always full. There is almost always no free space on any of the benches. We were also shelled twice at 10:30pm and then again at 11pm, apparently the first shelling was aimed at the same place as the one in the morning, and the second one sounded somewhat close to me. 

They also fired 7 missiles at us today, at 2:15am this time. At least 5 hit the city, all of them landed in 5 different districts, and the other 2 landed in Kharkiv oblast. Explosions 2-5 sounded very close to me, it was very loud. One of the explosions‚Äô sound lasted for around 7-10 seconds after the initial blast. That is the longest one we heard so far, I don‚Äôt know what really causes it.

Apparently they also fired their missiles from a different place today, and for a good reason, because one of the missiles yesterday malfunctioned, and landed in Russia, near Belgorod, in Veselaya Lopan. There were civilian casualties, they definitely won‚Äôt show that in their news, they never do, but people complained, which is the most likely reason of why they changed the spot from which they were firing missiles.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 August 2022
 
- On 11 August 2022, Russian media reported that Denis Pushilin, head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), had said that the date of a referendum on the DPR joining Russia will be announced after the DPR's 'complete liberation'.

- Previously, in June 2022, investigative journalists published evidence of a DPR planning strategy for running such a referendum and for ensuring that at least 70 per cent of votes were in favour of joining Russia. It is likely that Russia is in the advanced planning stages to hold a referendum, though it is unclear if the final decision to go ahead with a vote has yet been taken.

- The Kremlin will likely see the military's failure to occupy the entirety of Donetsk Oblast thus far as a setback for its maximalist objectives in Ukraine.

While the numbers came out a bit better for Russia on Q2 than initially predicted, the contraction of the Russian economy in the range of 5%-10% (by end of 2023) would be seen as catastrophic in any Western country. Source for the numbers: https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/economy/2022/8/12/putinswar-sets-russian-economy-back-4-years-in-single-quarter

In contrast, the US economy contracted 4.3% in the Great Recession. Russia‚Äôs best cast scenario is still about 20% worse, with the potential to be more than double the contraction. Source on US numbers: https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-of-200709

More likely, their economy damage is crystallized with Ukraine benefiting from their loss.

Ukraine has a big challenge ahead of them. Yes, their newest weapons (HIMARS, HARM) look like they're working. But the next challenge is Ukraine's relatively small mechanized forces. Taking territory back traditionally is a job for tanks and mechanized infantry.

Ukraine has some, but not enough IMO. This means that the bulk of the push will have to be an old school infantry push. There will be no lightning offensives from Ukraine, they just don't have the tank power for that.

I think we have a general gist of how combat will go. Ukraine will use HIMARS to attack logistics and supplies. Then artillery guns (152mm and 155mm) once they're confident that they can win those fights (by blowing up Russian artillery ammo dumps, the Russians will be low on ammo and have a more difficult job firing back). The Russians will expend their ammo, and then be forced to retreat.

Ukrainians can march forward, but then the process starts again. Until either Russia orders a full retreat, or faster weapons arrive. This won't be an easy process.

-------------

Ukraine has enough tank forces that they'll have small, isolated pushes into Russian territory. Enough to keep the Russians on their toes and worried, but not enough to perform a large frontal attack like Russia did at the start of the conflict. (Then again: Russia didn't have enough logistics to support that kind of push either. It kind of was a on paper-push)

The good news, is that every day Russia continues to attack Ukraine (and yes, they're still attacking for some insane reason), is another day the Russians lost for defensive preparations. Russia should have been bulking up their defenses and digging in. Not... whatever the hell they're doing right now.

Then propaganda will announce an unconditional victory over the West, which was valiantly stopped at the Russian border.

His entourage and people, plunged in mass insanity or mental fog, for the most part, see his actions as necessary and justified. The eclectic ideas of a group of ignorant usurpers and their charlatans-philosophers and pseudo-historians have become culture and ideomythology. Most likely, Putin will continue to arrange his geopolitical *Island of Russia* until he dies or senile dementia finally takes over.

So countries like India, Iran, Indonesia, etc. can procure more hardware and on paper comparable for the same price as an American or European equivalent.

For example I found three comparable aircraft from around the same time period:
The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon Block C/D (entered production in 1984), the Dassault Mirage 2000C (entered production in 1982), and the Mikoyan MiG-29A (entered production in 1983).

The F-16 Fighting Falcon Block C/D has a roll away average unit cost of $25-$35 million, and with certain upgrades may cost as much as $40-$60 million.

The Mirage 2000C has a roll away average unit cost of approximately $23 million.

The MiG-29A has a roll away unit cost of $11-$20 million.

So for every one F-16 Fighting Falcon Block C/D a nation can purchase, they could procure between 1 and 6 MiG-29A‚Äôs. And for every Mirage 2000C a nation purchases, they could procure between 1 and 2 MiG-29A‚Äôs.

It allows more aircraft and parts to be purchased under most circumstances, which for cash strapped nations, is an attractive solution.

- significant changes to the status quo are unlikely in the immediate term, but if any do occur they're more likely to favour Ukraine

- if one does occur, a significant Ukrainian breakthrough *could* rapidly turn into a total Russian collapse‚Äîand a quick resolution like this would be the best outcome all round (minimise suffering etc), so we should do everything we can to help increase its likelihood

- in any event, Western support for Ukraine is not going to dissipate; whilst the intensity of military operations may wax and wane, training and equipping Ukraine to NATO standards will only accelerate

- periods of ceasefire may emerge providing opportunities for each side to regroup and consolidate their positions, but the war itself won't end and continuations of the conflict are guaranteed

- when those continuations occur, Ukraine will be even better trained and even better equipped to face down the Russian threat whereas it's unlikely Russia's equipment or training will have changed at all

- it is, in my view, inevitable that Ukraine will *eventually* repel Russia from her borders‚Äîbut, unfortunately, as with other conflicts (eg Afghanistan) the timeframe might be measured in years rather than months

- when Russia is eventually forced to withdraw, it will result in major upheaval within the Russian Federation on par with the collapse of the Soviet Union

No doubt, the prospect of such a protracted conflict with all its ensuing damage and suffering can at times be depressing and demoralising, and to that I don't have any magic solution except to keep an eye on the ultimate goal and remember that Ukraine is not alone: international friends and partners are helping in so many ways and on so many levels (though I appreciate not intervening in the conflict as directly as some would like).

>voted for Trump

You gotta choose one my guy. Cause those are diametrically opposed.

Looking at the current polls Trump is one top runners for 2024, and Tucker is the most watched news show in the US. You can't separate who you think are ""real"" Republicans and the ""Qanons and Tucker freaks"" because they are one and the same.

2 people have already killed themselves for Trump this week and so many Republicans are 
calling for civil war over the FBI search. As far as I'm concerned the Republican party is the party of Trump, and Trump will do anything for personal gain, including selling out the country to Putin, and the Republican party will tear this country apart to support Trump.

Edit: ""Apply serious pressure"" my brother in Christ, do you not remember trump, with the support of Republicans, sent javelins with the stipulation that they had to be kept in Western Ukraine in a warehouse and could not be used. And then tried to use further military aid as a quid pro quo for his own reelection. Once again willing to sell out the US for personal gain.

As far as I know, only one president has sent Ukraine the ability to ""apply serious pressure"" with HIMARS, M777, Stingers, Javelins, MRAPs, APCs, Counter artillery radar, anti air radar, along with funding for F-16 and F-15 training and aircraft. 

And that president sure as shit ain't Republican.

You need to shut the fuck up and take a good long look at your values and the Republican/Trump party and see if they align.

Look at politicians *actions* not their words.

Have to be careful about generalising a whole nation. Yes, there seem to be a lot of Russian citizens who either support the war, or express no opposition to it.
 
The only things that could excuse them from being inhuman savages are 1.) They fear retribution from the government and their security forces / paid thugs, and 2.) They are genuinely brainwashed / unaware of the reality of what Putin is doing to them, their country, and Ukraine, due to the complete censorship of the press, the internet, and television.

I have to say though, your comment comes across as a bit confused and strange. You say ""the anti Russian movement"", like it's some sort of established concept. 

Then you jump to talking about 911, saying ""anyone with a turban or scarf round their head was treated with disrespect or anger"". This is an exaggeration. I think most reasonable people were able to differentiate between a Muslim or Sikh (who are totally unconnected with Islamic Fundamentalist terrorism btw) coworker or fellow student for example, and Al-Qaeda terrorists.

Also, the vast majority of Muslims were, are, and have always been loudly against terrorism. The situation with Russia is not the same.

The state's intent was not only to honor such large families, but also to increase financial assistance for pregnant women, mothers of large families, and single mothers, and to promote an increased level of health in mother and child. The award was established in 1944 and continued to exist until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

In reference to giving up Crimea:

>Many people ask, when Navalny becomes President, what will he do with Crimea? And the question is not very easy. On one hand, the annexation of Crimea was a crime against Russian interests, a violation of international treaties, it caused sanctions, it caused isolation. On the other hand, unfortunately, the idea of the annexation of Crimea was so popular among many Russian voters between 2014 and 2021. Imagine any next President of Russia. If they were publicly advocating for the idea of giving Crimea back to Ukraine‚Äîbefore this war, they would probably be ousted. We hope the Russia of the future will be a democracy, and in a democracy, the opinion of the voters counts, and is important. And this created a very complicated puzzle for the next president. **Well, now I believe that after this war, it‚Äôll be very clear that in order to rebuild relations with Ukraine, to return to the civilized world, Russia will just have to do it.** It will be clear for everyone that it was like the first of Putin‚Äôs crimes, very clearly connected with other painful crimes that he committed.",False,1660588238.0,t3_wopod1,t1_ikeoxj4,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

It gets talked about a lot that Wagner group I'd doing the bulk of Russia's attacking but they are describing a similar situation on the Ukrainian side were they only have a very small amount of battalions capable of pressing an attack. It doesn't take much training to hold a line and the Ukrainians have proved absolutely fierce in this posture but advancing on enemy positions requires another level of soilder. The units that have done all the attacking on both sides are diminished and being replenished with inferior newly trained soilders. There are so few units available that when either side does get a small break through they don't have enough additional aggressive forces to press that advantage and that's why things have been more or less stalled. A large number of Ukraines total forces which I think was quoted at 500 or 700 thousand are territorial defense, conscripts and reserves which have again been outstanding in defensive posture but can't be counted on for attack due to training and age. The complicated coordination with other infantry units, armor and artillery takes a crazy amount of training and practice while in defence the artillery with new drone technology can organicly pick find its own targets and correct its own fire. 

A lot of the initial over estimation of Russian forces in the western military analayis community came from looking at Russia in Syria were on a much smaller operation they seemed reasonably capable of combined arms operation but they couldn't scale it up and inevitably reverted to the old ways. Ukraine has yet to test their ability to be aggressive on scale and they've lost a lot of experienced troops who've been trainingvand fighting since 2014 so not many of the people who get paid to think about this stuff for the US are willing to place a bet either way on the outcome of a potential Ukrainian offensive on the southern front.",False,1660545530.0,t3_wopod1,t1_ikcj9c5,,2,28,0,28,0,0,

Western countries will continue to offer training and education, both in military terms and hopefully free access to universities for Ukrainian grads (I know Ukraine has good universities too but every bit helps). 

I think in 4-5 years Ukraine will be stronger and more advanced, both as a country and a military, while Russia will not be able to get it's shit together. And Ukraine will be so fortified it's ridiculous. Nevermind think of trying to sell another Ukraine war in Russian recruitment offices?

This strategy is feasible functionally forever, the % loss in the Russian advance is comparable to WW1 gains. In May the Russians in effect lost territory nearly the size of Belgium.

Russia's casualties are mounting. Now we know that DPR/LPR has been drained of young men and old alike.

Russia is also aware that Escalation has been met with continued Escalation from the West.

I think what people mistake is Mobilization in Russia = Putin Leadership in peril. This isn't true as most Russians follow Putin and his Leadership. The issue is purely that any Mobilization will be met with Western response so it is a gamble whether putting Russians Draft will actually lead to an advantage.

Russia is out of steam more or less now already and can no longer make decisive or large offenses. This is likely not to change unless something very drastic changes.

The reality is that government bailouts / handouts / however you want to spin them have a track record of putting money into private companies' coffers and providing few tangible benefits for the government footing the bill. ""Stability"" is all well and good, but a government bailout with no strings attached does not provide proper incentives for private industry to not repeat the same behaviour.

If you need examples, you can look at what happened when the US bailed out the banks in the sub-prime lending scandal. Of course there was no option to let those banks fail, that would have wrecked the entire US economy and sent the world at large into a horrible recession. But could those bailouts for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been done in exchange for Class A shares that would give the government voting rights and purview into the companies' inner workings? Sure! And that would have been much better for the general public, and would have stung the banks a lot more.

I've seen a similar thing happen, although at a smaller scale, in Canada. Our governments have bailed out Air Canada multiple times, and with good reason. We definitely need to have a national air carrier from coast-to-coast-to-coast, but the unfortunate reality is that we (Canadians) have not gotten a whole lot out of that deal, except more federal debt.

1. Ukraine's domestic issues pre-war, particularly around corruption.

2. Wartime gives an extraordinary ability to make drastic changes to things that would normally meet stiff domestic resistance, consider it in context of 1.

3. President Zelenskyy doesn't strike me as someone who learns slowly.

There is a chance, post-war that President Zelenskyy demonstrates some significant improvements to pre-war corruption and has a good handle on how to more quickly align with EU and meet their standards, having learned so much during the war.

And Ukraine isn't sitting idly by on the corruption point, as it's an even greater risk in war than in peace-time.

So I don't know, maybe he will be able to get another term post-war, I think it'll depend how he can demonstrate improvements and sell his ability moving forward.

 >Alexander Litvinenko was a former officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and the KGB. In 1998, Litvinenko and several other Russian intelligence officers said they were ordered to kill Boris Berezovsky, a Russian businessman. After that, the Russian government began to persecute Litvinenko. He fled to the UK, where he criticised the Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.

You still have the same problem that someone has to pay for that increase. You can't just have utilities racking up debts with suppliers by selling natural gas below market value to customers and then waive the debt away by going into bankruptcy, if you don't pay those suppliers they will stop delivering and then you have no gas at all.

There is no amount of ""oversight"" that can change the fact the cost of fossil fuels in Europe have skyrocketed, someone has to pay that. The utilities have to pass the increased cost in to someone, that someone is either the government or the end consumer. Sure maybe you could save a little by finding some efficiencies in the actual operation of the business but when the cost of what you're selling has gone up someone has to lay for it.

What you're suggesting is like trying to reduce the price of bread by ordering a bakeries to sell it for the same price even though the price of wheat doubled.

On tanks and individual pieces it's possible Russia has an edge but as we've seen, they lack scale and industrial base.

It's not a tech or scale thing comparing them to Russia though, even just on economics, CCP absolutely shits all over them. And even if they had comparable levels of corruption, their return on investment will be far higher due to money in.

And if we look at tech, industrial base and other such factors, CCPs military hardware should be very strong just on logic.

The question becomes how quickly have CCP modernised.

At least in air power, a lot. While plane for plane theirs may not be quite as good as allied tech, they're definitely being used in operational numbers as we see them regularly around South China Sea.

I'm talking about people who have always stood against the system and now that act is becoming more dangerous than ever. Take one family I know who recently got asylum in Germany and subsequently moved to Montenegro. Their whole family has been supporting opposition politics, attending protests, spreading awareness, since long before 2014 even. They've had their brushes with the police, stints in jail, but until this year these punishments weren't catastrophic. They paid their fines and went straight back to it. 

In March, after attending protests in Petersburg, they had armoured cops with assault rifles break their door down, kneel on their necks, threaten all sorts of horrible suffering to them, stole their shit like cash and other things, and promised to ruin their lives if it happens again. 

They are not alone. I'm an ESL teacher, been in Petersburg for almost ten years. Basically my job has been helping these people get opportunities out and I've had dozens of my students get asylum and they all had the same experiences. They are not what you call my impression of ""innocent Russians"". This fucking strawman is so annoying. Obviously I don't fucking believe apathetic Russians who suddenly got uncomfortable are innocent and deserve asylum immediately.

I'm talking about people who are literally having threats to take their kids away, getting blacklisted from ever working, getting beaten or even raped in jail, because they haven't given up.

From what my Ukrainian speaking relatives and friends have told me my understanding was that he campaigned on a platform to clean up corruption but that he wasn't very successful at it before the war. And since he was supported by his oligarch friend Ihor Kolomoisky who funded his campaign and used the media he owned to help get Zelensky elected when he got into office and things didn't seem to improve after a couple years many people started to think he was just more of the same problem, a politician with rich friends who had no interest in cleaning up government.

My understanding is that Zelensky really did try to reform things but as an outsider to the political establishment it was difficult. He kept running into resistance within government departments that didn't want to change the way they were doing things because the people in charge of them were getting rich from syphoning off the top.

Now with his popularity sky high he has managed to make some important reforms and has passed some bills aimed at making it more clear where political parties get their donations from and to make an oligarch registry of the businesses they own so that the public can see who owns what and how they might be benefitting from their monopolies in certain areas. He has also somewhat controversially banned some smaller political parties that were either caught getting funding from Russia or were extreme right wing fanatics potentially also funded by Russia to stir up trouble.

I don't know if these moves will be effective in combating corruption but as much as war can cause corruption to sky rocket it can conversely be used by those in charge to clamp down on misbehavior on a way they would never get away with in peace time. A small example of that would be the Ukrainian army guys arresting police officers who were extorting money from civilians at a security check point near the front. They were told by several people they weren't letting people by without a bribe, sadly Ukrainian police expecting bribes is commonplace, and the soldiers just grabbed them, took their guns and carted them off. You'd never get away with that in peace time but during a war, well hey, don't piss off the guys doing the fighting for you I guess.

Like those soldiers if Zelensky can use the war to actually make progress against corruption that was hard to make during peace time that could turn out to be a silver lining to all this death and destruction. Not enough to make it worth it of course but hopefully it makes for a better Ukraine afterwards.

>Are you seriously saying that Russians have less ferries than Germans had transport ships in late 1944-45? Russia have hundreds if not thousands of these ferries that were mass produced in the soviet union.

No, I'm saying the Russians don't have the means/ability to maintain the Kherson bridgehead. They might have some of requisite elements to conduct a successful supply operation (and it *would* be an operation); i.e. barges/ferries/special AFVs, but to use them successfully requires a number of other things missing from that local theatre; air superiority (or adequate AA coverage in the absence of the RU Air Force), ground force superiority, and a solid logistics network (if RU can't keep it's frontline with a land bridge fully supplied, it's likely a stretch to think supplying Kherson, via Crimea, will be any easier).   


>There are literally zero ferries sunk so far by the Ukrainians.

Any weapon that is within range will be a threat to any crossing of the size needed to sustain the Russian group on the other side. Planes, drones, artillery, HIMARs, TOCHKA-U, floating mines...  


>There is zero evidence so far that Russians are having any trouble with supplying the bridgehead currently

So the obvious response to a question like this is; what evidence do we have to suggest that the Russian forces are being adequately supplied? 

We just saw reports of occupation-administration folks abandoning Kherson for the other side of the river. That's not a good sign.   


Your comment also runs counter to the UK's assessment of the Russian situation in Kherson: [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1558330118317162503/photo/1](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1558330118317162503/photo/1)

  How many ferries do they have?  How far is the original rail head from the ferry crossing?  How far do the trucks have drive after crossing to the end using units? How long does a crossing take?

Gut gud.

Edit.  For anyone else reading , I'm not sure where this T72 vs truck weight comes from.  He must be confusing another comment thread or something.
