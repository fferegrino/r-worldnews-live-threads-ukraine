First, I would like to make it clear that plan A of Putin and all those who run the Russian state is a PEACEFUL solution. That is, to obtain an OFFICIAL document from NATO that rejects Ukraine's entry, and if this is not possible, that Ukraine itself considers itself a neutral state and refuses to enter NATO.  
  
Of course, Putin knew that he could wait for the Zelensky government to end, and for the next election to have a president willing to quit the idea of NATO.  
  
But no, for various reasons (mainly because the Ukrainian population is more and more sympathetic to NATO), Putin decided that it was time to put an end to this problem, which is probably his last ""big problem"" and that if he solves it He will leave his successors a ""safer"" Russia, in addition to increasing his support at home.  
  
For this reason, Putin decided to start sending the Russian army from almost the entire country (including the Far East) and therefore reducing the protection of large areas of the country (something that could put Russia's national security at risk), in addition to probably spending hundreds of millions during these last few months (even billions).  
  
But why? Simple, to put pressure on the West and Ukraine to solve the ""Ukrainian problem"" and national security and at the same time destabilize Ukraine and weaken it the more the better.  
  
Now, Putin has realized that the West is not going to give in, and therefore right now he has several options in his hand, from returning his troops to their bases (something that seems unlikely to me), or deciding to continue with the invasion .  
  
In my opinion, we still have to wait for the US to receive the Russian document-response to European security issues (which they have been drafting for a month).  
  
I believe that based on that document, and the subsequent US response, Putin will decide his next actions.  
  
In any case, I think we will have to wait these days and see if on the 20th Putin really sends the troops home after the military games are over. That is a very important date in this whole situation.

As for the date of February 16, I believe that the American intelligence was referring to the fact that the troops were warned to be prepared for that day, and not necessarily that the invasion began at that time (we can even see that the worst cyberattcak in Ukraine's history happened yesterday, the same tactic that Putin used before invading Georgia). 

Finally, people must understand that Putin is not necessarily going to invade Ukraine at first, in fact, he could simply provoke a coup against Zelensky, and send ""little green men"" to protect the new leader. If an insurrection starts against that new satellite state, then Putin would intervene. In any case, in my opinion Kharkiv will be the first place to be attacked in case of invasion.  
  
Other things that must be fulfilled for the conflict to start in my opinion are:

Back on 15 Jan when the LSTs left the Baltic and Northern Fleets, I wrote they’d likely be brought to the Black Sea for a possible amphibious assault landing at Odessa or Mariupol in tandem with an overland push.

They did in fact go to the Black Sea and Russia has kept an AGI (intelligence collection ship) loitering about 20 miles off the coast of Odessa for about 1-2 weeks so far. They then released a NOTAM saying they were closing off waters around Odessa to all commercial shipping and airlines. It seems way too obvious. 

It’s been confirmed now some units in Crimea are leaving, whether they’re going to their home garrison or being repositioned is yet to be seen.

I think the most likely conclusion to be drawn is the Crimean buildup was always possibly for show, or a feint. I’ve noticed their smallest buildup by far is their troops nearest the Donbas-150th motorised rifle division hasn’t done shit so far yet it lives like 40 miles from the UA border. What gives?

Crimean units may swing over that way and reinforce that buildup while Russia says they’re de-escalating/pulling troops out. LSTs may depart. An amphibious assault would be difficult to pull off and Kyiv seems to clearly be the target based on their posturing in Belarus/Kursk/Belgorod regions. 

This is all speculative but we’ll see.

Edit: now that I’m seeing more Russian narratives of “genocide” in the Donbas, etc. I’m almost certain some of these units are going to swing over to the Rostov region.

They have clear goals, prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, mainly. If that can be achieved through diplomacy then an invasion is quite unlikely, simply due to the costs involved. While a bluff might be expensive, it’s much cheaper than an invasion.

NATO has made it quite clear that it will not rule out Ukraine membership if it chooses to join. Ukraine has not yet abandoned the idea. However, diplomacy is continuing. Be assured there are many private conversations between governments that we will probably never hear of for a few decades.

The moment diplomacy begins to lead nowhere, it will simply come down to whether Russia believes the cost of an invasion is worth paying for the result.

Edit: as I said in another comment, regarding Russia’s decision to invade: lives, money, sanctions, military equipment, etc… are all just numbers in the equation. They do the math, and decide whether they can foot the bill and if it’s worth it to prevent Ukraine joining nato. There is no morality in the upper levels of a dictatorship.

The T-90 is a third-generation Russian main battle tank that entered service in 1993. It is an advanced tank in service with Russian Ground Forces and the Naval Infantry. The T-90 uses a 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore main gun, the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded engine, and gunner's thermal sight. Standard protective measures include a blend of steel and composite armour, smoke grenade dischargers, Kontakt-5 explosive-reactive armour and the Shtora infrared ATGM jamming system.

### T-90 Tank Has A Fatal Flaw

Russia gave 30 T-90s to the Syrian Army. At least five were taken out of action by rebel anti-tank missiles – a pretty mediocre performance. This may be the T-90s weak point – ambushing them with hits to the turret from anti-tank missiles.

But in Syria, the rebels used TOW-2A missiles they got from the Americans. TOW stands for “Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided.” This is not a fire and forget system. The TOW must be tracked by the vision of the operator. The operator keeps the sight’s crosshairs centered over the target until impact. The TOW-2A was moderately successful against the T-90. 

### The Javelin Anti-tank Missile

The U.S. Military’s Javelin is fire and forget and it is devastating to an enemy tank. Operators do not have to optically target the missile. There is no further input required after launch. The Javelin is portable and shoulder-fired. While still around 50 pounds, the Javelin is a lot more manageable than the TOW, which requires a heavy tripod. The Javelin can be used in day or night, and in all kinds of weather. Just align the infrared sensor with a target and the Javelin does the rest.

The T-90 has countermeasures that it can engage to try and spoof the Javelin. T-90’s Shtora-1 active protection system is designed to jam the infrared sensors of anti-tank missiles. The Shtora-1 can send out smoke grenades that release an infrared-masking aerosol cloud. The Shtora-1 also has an early warning system that can sense when it is being “lased” by the enemy.

### Ukraine Has Javelins

The Russians are concerned about the Javelin because the T-90 had some problems against the TOW-2A that was used by untrained rebels. In 2018, Ukraine bought 37 Javelin launchers and 210 of the Javelin missiles.

The Javelin has a range of two-and-a-half miles and three miles when launched from a vehicle. Remember, this is fire, and forget. It would not be difficult to set up an ambush of three launchers and a good number of missiles to take out T-90 tanks, no matter how good their countermeasures. Russia has a problem with its T-90 tanks and that is the threat from anti-tank missiles, especially the Javelin. If the older TOWs can penetrate the armor, you know the Javelin can too.",False,1645066902.0,t3_su6qp2,t3_su6qp2,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

You have also seen the cyber warfare attacks target the banks and other financial institutions disproportionately. 

This is called economic warfare and is part of the Russian effort to regain control over Ukraine. 

Russia can continue to escalate and de-escalate yearly thus driving away any prospect of economic growth in Ukraine for the foreseeable future.

1.) Decapitate Ukrainian civilian leadership and military command and control. Either through air strikes targeted directly at Kyiv and Live, or with helicopter-borne commando teams. The purpose of this action would be to sow chaos in the the Ukrainian military, and to cow a successor government. 

2.) A ""limited"" incursion in Eastern Ukraine, likely to push at least as far as the total territorial claims of DNR and LNR. This would essentially mean swallowing major territory, including the port city of Mariupol, and forcing a land connection to Crimea, but not pushing all the way to the entire course of the Dnieper. 

I think Putin has ambitions to swallow all of Ukraine, but it's clear that's not feasible. He probably believes he can make at least some Eastern territorial grabs without getting caught up in a prolonged insurgency.

Now those of us who had any kind of respect for him will feel he is not nearly as intelligent as we thought and is in fact a weak coward who lost his nerve at the sight of the full force NATO if he doesn't invade.

Let me be clear. No one asked for Putin to threaten a major war. He did this. All we did was wait for the war his actions promised. If there is no invasion, it is a good thing for Ukraine but a GREAT thing for Joe Biden. Joe Biden will go down in history as the man that Putin feared.

Probably. That would explain why the US and NATO are quick to point out troop movements, any classified intel they get, etc as soon as it comes across their desks.

This infuriates and frustrates Putin, who is attempting to use clever espionage and ""questionable"" military drills to mask a real possibility of an invasion, but holding off on moving major combined arms groups into an actual fighting position. It could also be the real thing, and Putin is attempting to change the play call (again with frustration) in order to catch Ukraine, NATO and the US off guard.

That doesn't surprise me. That ship is likely doubling as a recon ship and a command ship, and we know that.

“The armed formations of Ukraine grossly violated the ceasefire, using weapons that, in accordance with the Minsk agreements, should be withdrawn,” he said.

Close, but the dazzler countermeasures on the Shtora-1 were designed to confuse TOW missile tracking, not the Javelin

The rear end of the tow missile has a beacon that is tracked by the infared camera of the gunner station to guide the missile.  The dazzlers replicated this signature, confusing the system of the TOW by showing 3 different signatures instead of just the one from the missile and causing the missile to think it was one of the dazzlers and spin out of control.

But of course we came up with ways to change the signature of the beacon to be distinct from the dazzlers, defeating the countermeasures.  The TOWs given to Syrian rebels were probably the ones without the latest and greatest beacons etc.",False,1645067930.0,t3_su6qp2,t1_hx9f32s,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

You might have seen the images of all age groups having done some arms training in recent days to potentially fight Russia, that's a common thing in Ukraine. I used to know somebody from Ukraine who moved to live where I live. Even as kids they're already thought about the threat and are taught to handle weapons (I'm not sure if that's a national or regional thing). A very large number of Ukranians might be able to pick up arms. A war in Ukraine could be near unwinnable due to this, a large number of random houses in a city could have somebody suddenly fire a rifle or even a rocket launcher. In comparison, the US had lots of trouble with insurgents in Iraq, while in Iraq it was a small fraction of the population supporting insurgents. In Ukraine, a majority of the populace might support it, making it nearly impossible for Russians to get a stable foodhold. At least in parts of the country, Russian troops could face guerilla attacks at a scale we've barely seen in other conflicts. With Russian troops automatically resorting to genocide-like attacks to try to quell such attacks through fear and simply out of revenge, but just enraging the populace more.

Seems like Russia is also training kids to fight in separatist regions.

The only scenario that is somewhat survivable for Russia, is the ""genocide on Russian speakers"" they seem to try to fake, to then solely invade Russian speaking regions (where Putin has decent support) with other troops on the borders of the rest of Ukraine in an attempt to hold them into a chokehold and spread out Ukranian troops as a way to try to prevent Ukraine from responding militarily. Potentially with an incursion towards Kiev too purely as a distraction and to draw the focus of Ukranian troops all the while they invade the parts of Ukraine that they truly want to occupy.",False,1645060140.0,t3_su6qp2,t1_hx8w4cd,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Close to 170,000 soldiers are already deployed in positions, said Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service.

Attack from Russia would include missile bombardment and the occupation of “key terrain”, Mr Marran said.

“If Russia is successful in Ukraine, it would encourage it to increase pressure on the Baltics in the coming years,” he said.

“The threat of war has become the main policy tool for Putin.”

 There's Belarus but well obviously they're not friends with Ukraine right now. Finland has no cultural ties to Ukraine really, and neither country has ever independently enacted much influence over the other. The Finns are pretty self reliant as a culture, they're not really ones to go out and eagerly look for military treaties with others. And trying to support a militsry alliance when your main rival splits you in half geographically is tough when you don't have the economy of the US. 

Kazakhstan for all the reasons above, probably closer culturally than they are to a Nordic country but everything else still applies.

The Balkans are also no. I mean, Ukraine certainly isn't culturally alike to Serbia, Bosnia, and kosovo. But it's a lot closer than it is to Finland or Khazikstan. If more balkans weren't NATO it'd be more in the realm of ""improbable but not impossible"" but neither area really has the military or really the economy 

But these countries probably haven't joined nato for the same reason Austria and Switzerland haven't, because NATO forms a protective shell around them.

As long as Russia continues to build up its an on going crisis, when actual de-escalation occurs and Ukraine can stand down, there probably won't be stickied live threads anymore. 

Russia can keep this up probably for another week or two at most before this massive military build up hurts their economy, they're taking a large force that would otherwise perform a multitude of critical functions all around the country and putting them in one place with one goal of ""exercise"".

If it truly is an exercise we can expect to see them wrapping up within a that time. However, that's exactly what they did before the Georgian Invasion. That invasion prelude was interesting because Americans not only knew Russians were conducting a military exercise on the georgian border, but the Americans took part in an unofficial-but-probably-agreed-upon-secretly joint exercise with the georgians. The exercise ended late July, Russians attacked early August. Of course 2008 Georgia vs Russia is not 2020 Ukraine vs Russia, Russia has been much more secretive and impulsive this time which might be bait, only time will tell.

This isn't the 1940s anymore, even the most basic infantryman needs so much specialized knowledge that even if you instituted a general draft, your troops wouldn't be ready for at least a year - and if you're having problems getting manpower for the front line (the whole reason you'd institute a draft to begin with), that's not helpful. On top of that, this is *just* the infantry we're talking about - foot soldiers who hold a rifle, maybe a few grenades, a radio at most. You want them to drive anything, even a humvee or a truck? More training time. You want them to use anti-tank weapons? More training time. Tanks are even worse. And all of that is *just* for ground forces - you can forget entirely about replacing attrition in the Navy, the Air Force, or even the Army Air Corps in any reasonable amount of time. In short, if you insist on a draft, all you're getting is the most basic of infantry - which in a modern peer conflict is more or less completely useless. The age of modern precision long-range weaponry means that the battlefield can be totally controlled from the air, without any risk to the aircraft other than... other aircraft, or antiaircraft batteries that again require specialist training to effectively use - not that the US really has antiaircraft batteries to begin with, we kind of just rely on having more air superiority aircraft than Russia and China have aircraft total to provide our air defense. No, if the US and Russia were to go to war - or the US and China for that matter - and somehow don't ever escalate to nuclear weaponry, the war would be decided entirely in the air and at sea, with whichever side achieves air superiority emerging the victor eventually.

So in short, when the Repbulicans do try to re-institute the draft, two things will happen: First, the military is going to complain about how pointless it is, and how much it hurts morale. They will be ignored. Second, you're not actually going to be trained for a frontline combat role; at worst, you'll still have to do your PT, and you'll probably still learn how to shoot a gun just in case, but even the dumbest officer alive today understands that draftees stand exactly zero chance on a modern battlefield, and deploying them in any significant number would if anything make the situation at the front line *weaker*, as units made entirely of draftees would put up no resistance at all to professional soldiers, and mixing the draftees in with veterans would if anything be even worse, as now your veterans have to cover for the draftees' shortcomings - which again, the enemy could easily exploit. No, you'll be handed off to whatever random-ass Private is unlucky enough to get the job and trained to do some sort of clerical shit. That could be anything from managing Army intelligence, distributing reconnaissance, if you're really lucky you'll get stuck in logistics and get to scalp all the good MREs. But your chances of seeing any actual combat, or even leaving the country, will be slim to none. But again I cannot stress this enough - you're still going to have to do PT. There isn't a soldier in the world who would miss the chance to make a bunch of civvies go through PT. Hell, they'll film it and ship the videos to the front line to boost morale.",False,1645082826.0,t3_su6qp2,t1_hxa41zp,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

They know that there are a lot of people who will not bother fact checking it and will believe the narrative regardless so long as it confirms their existing biases. They are likely to be in media/social media bubbles where they never see stories debunking it. If anyone does fact check it and present evidence to these people they will likely be called a shill and a propagandist themselves turning populations against each other with idiotic arguments over nonsense.

The ultimate outcome is people stop knowing what is true and what isn't. This can lead to them not trusting in real information or just giving up caring about what is happening at all. It also enables real atrocities to be commited but just dismissed as more lies.

Meanwhile a chunk of the population increasingly believe in nothing but nonsense and insanity and can be radicalised to extremist actions. The wider world is less likely to take the risk posed by these people seriously because their beliefs are all so ridiculous and easily debunked, ie QAnon.

 >The great-circle distance, orthodromic distance, or spherical distance is the distance along a great circle. It is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior). The distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a straight line between them, but on the sphere there are no straight lines. In spaces with curvature, straight lines are replaced by geodesics.

 >Estonia–Russia relations (Российско-эстонские отношения, Estonian: Eesti-Vene suhted) refers to bilateral foreign relations between Estonia and Russia. Diplomatic relations between the Republic of Estonia and the Russian SFSR were established on 2 February 1920, when Soviet Russia recognized de jure the independence of the Republic of Estonia, and renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia, via the Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian). At the time, the Bolsheviks had just gained control of the majority of Russian territory, and their government's legitimacy was being hotly contested by Western powers and the Russian White movement.

Poaching is becoming more and more prevalent. There really isn’t much of anything else that can be done. There is no other option but to try and increase the deterrents. In this case that is the fines.  What do  you propose? 
Complete fishing ban for a period of time.      
     
-- i am assuming poacher numbers are included in the annual recreational catch statistics below, correct me if im wrong --    
    
     
According to ASMFC, in 2019 the total recreational catch for striped bass in the region was 30.9 million fish.     
     
2.2 million of that total was harvested.  
28.8 million of that total was released, 9% of which (2.6 million) are estimated to die from the interaction
 
So, assuming poachers dont release any fish, non poachers via discard mortality kill all 2.6 million of these fish annually, the vast majority of which are, of course, released because they are undersized or oversized.       
    
Even if you assume 100% of total harvested fish were harvested by poachers (which would mean zero legal fish were caught and kept), poachers still only account for 2.2 million deaths.        
    
SO
      
Of the annual 2.2 million total harvested fish, If the fraction caught by poachers is responsible for threatening the striped bass fishery and jeopardizing its future, if the fishery will be saved and prosper if we just eliminated these poachers,     
      
then the 2.6 million striped bass that die after being released by the law abiding 'stewards', the majority of which are exactly the type of fish that is most beneficial to the fishery, could revive the species and secure the fishery for the future..     
     
Instead of fantasizing about eliminating poachers, you stewards have the power to save the striped bass fishery by simply not fishing.    
     
But how the hell do you get all the law abiding stewards to agree not to fish for a year?    
     
 Ban recreational striper fishing.  set the limit to 0 for one year.  The fishery is saved and the best part for all you lusty disciplinarians?  you can still revel in the capture and punishment of poachers, which are now easier to identify.

 >Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create two-dimensional images or three-dimensional reconstructions of objects, such as landscapes. SAR uses the motion of the radar antenna over a target region to provide finer spatial resolution than conventional stationary beam-scanning radars. SAR is typically mounted on a moving platform, such as an aircraft or spacecraft, and has its origins in an advanced form of side looking airborne radar (SLAR). The distance the SAR device travels over a target during the period when the target scene is illuminated creates the large synthetic antenna aperture (the size of the antenna).

It was the aim to throw the Ukrainians (and NATO) off guard by invading from the south (Sevastopol comes to mind, but I'm sure there are other invasion routes). But the US Navy, Royal Navy, Spanish Navy and French Navy is complicating matters. Greatly.

>a completely new approach 

Nearly 20 years ago admirals and generals alike at the Pentagon pulled and dusted off an old NATO manual on combat operations in Eastern Europe. It was written back in the 1950's and 1960's but it was hardly touched or amended during the time it sat in the pentagon's secured rooms. One of the operations that was to be conducted was very similar to how the Americans handled the Cuban missile crisis, by blasting picture after picture of soviet mrbm's being set up in the jungles of Cuba. This massive show of reconnaissance frustrated and overwhelmed Khrushchev. Eventually a deal was struck on the side but the deal was in America's favor (despite most of the world not knowing about the decommissioning of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey).

Putin is aware of this strategy but doesn't understand how the military works in a large theater. His sole mission was to intimidate Ukraine and NATO by intervening in their governments (something the old pentagon manual called ""communist infiltration of government services"")

It didn't really work, but Putin's efforts to try and one up this Cold War era playbook did some damage (Trump and the division of politics in America, Brexit etc).

What's ironic is Putin is wanting a return to the pre-communist era power he thinks Russia was. A kind of super ""Russia"" where instead of the czar, you have a president for life (in this case Putin). His actions to try to limit European influence into Ukraine backs this theory, and isnt the first time Russia tried to play ""the game"" with foreign powers over the status of the Donbas and Crimean regions....",False,1645061052.0,t3_su6qp2,t1_hx8x48e,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

The ""surprise"" was to send in Russian forces masking as ""peacekeepers"" in order to restore law and order in Crimea, but the problem for Putin is we knew exactly what he was doing from the very very beginning. Now it comes down to a choice, chose another date to launch this ""surprise"" invasion or pull back completely.

NATO worn allow Russia to join. NATO could easily lower tensions and avoid war if they just didn't allow Ukraine to join. Ukraine has 250,000 military personal, supported by tens of thousands of tonnes of military equipment supplied to them by the UK and USA. Who is more likely to win that war? 

If you're suggesting Putin is more of a warmongerer than the USA I can't even be bothered to explain to you how stupid that statement is. The USA has been at war non stop since world war 2. Just last year, they were at war with SEVEN countries. The UK has been at war with one country or another for over 100 years. If you don't already know that, look it up.

I'm not saying Putin or Russia are morally good or innocent. There are no good and bad guys this isn't a fucking Hollywood movie. But if you think Putin is this war hungry dictator who just wants to invade Ukraine to seize more land for what is already the largest country in the world, and risk going to war with the world's most powerful countries and being destroyed, you are seriously mistaken my friend.

Oh yeah, no invasion. 

Actually what happened was the UK and USA then started selling billions of dollars of weapons to Ukraine. So Russia anticipated an attack by the Ukraine. Ukraine joined the list of potential members for NATO, which further escalated tensions. Russia starts building up forces along its border out of fear of a NATO invasion as it looks more and more likely that Ukraine will now be a part of the world's most powerful military alliance, one which won't allow Russia to join. So Russia builds up forces on its borders in anticipation of the threat of the Ukraine. How the fuck can you not see that Ukraine and NATO are provoking Russia? 

Do you think that before a country invades another country they all just wait at the border lol. Go and learn some war history, they don't just wait at the border. Border build ups are a defense tactic, not an Invasion tactic. If they were planning to invade they'd go straight in, or build up further away and then move in on Ukraine.

Everything they've imposed on Ukraine and are trying to impose on them has had a design of preventing Ukraine from ever being able to apply for NATO membership. Look at the Minsk agreements: they give separatist regions VETO power when it comes to Ukraine applying to join NATO or the EU. Why haven't they absorbed the separatist republics yet? Because they won't be an influence on Ukraine at that point and will remove one of the roadblocks for Ukraine joining NATO.

 Crimea is a net negative for Russia financially, the more pro-Ukrainian regions they take over and have to occupy - the more expensive it will become. I.e. conquering this territory will cost money- not make it. They will be also sanctioned heavily for it, causing even bigger losses.

I assume you mean sending peacekeepers to Donbass, not Crimea. 

Maybe he'll send some forces there based on what the international court says about the graves there. I hate how people are treating that matter as if it didn't happen. Whether Putin is right or not, Ukraine did shell innocent people with their artillery. You can't just close your eyes to that.

Along with some two dozen similar incidents, the attack was manufactured by Germany as a casus belli to justify the invasion of Poland, which began the next morning. The attackers posed as Polish nationals.

>Do you really think Russia would be this obvious in planning?


Yes, Georgia and Crimea had the exact same MO. You really don't see the similarities? Hell, there's even more troops than when they annexed Crimea.

If Russia didn't want NATO at their borders they shouldn't have annexed the Georgian provinces and Crimea, because that's when Ukraine applied for NATO, and that's when three popularity for joining rose. Russia is afraid of NATO at their borders but rather than trying to support the countries around them they threaten them, leading exactly to the point where we are now.

I do agree it's sick how much money they make on warfare, but that by itself is a whole different story.

It was also the Ukrainians who asked for defensive measures by NATO because they expected an attack. They didn't ask for forces, they asked for defensive weapons. But it was them who asked.

I agree it would come at a great cost and be catastrophic for the world. Still, it would be negligent to rule that China would never invade Taiwan. If the world falls into a recession and the CPP begin diminishing their hold on the Chinese people (honestly a likely outcome with more Westernized teenagers and young adults) I would predict they would try to invade Taiwan to legitimize their power in the eyes of the Chinese. 

Living in China it is evident that the Chinese desire Taiwan. Many conversations with Chinese often lead to ""what do you think about Taiwan?""

It's all good, I understand it's a worrying situation, sorry if I sounded harsh, too ^^

>2. It is in NATO's interest to keep its member nations border secure. Ukraine is being threatened with invasion. What do you think will happen if any Russian army approaches within miles of the Polish, Romanian or Moldavian borders? 

Of course, that's perfectly reasonable. I'm just saying that sanctions will happen regardless of the reasoning behind the invasion. Ukraine has done some really shady and shitty things after 2014's coup, and they were never punished for it because they were now of some use to the powers that be. Like, people say that NATO is a defensive organization, yet they are sending weapons to a nation that is not a member. This doesn't sound very defensive to me.
