The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) appears to be conducting a large-scale overhaul of domestic security organs, according to the Institute for the Study of War

TASS reported yesterday that the FSB and the Main Directorate of the Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) have been conducting mass checks at the Moscow Central District Internal Affairs Directorate and several Moscow district police offices for the past several weeks.

This is reportedly due to ""the leakage of data from Russian security forces at the request of Ukrainian citizens.""

Another Russian source said that the FSB and MVD had already detained police officers as part of this investigation.

Russian outlets reported that the police officers are suspected of leaking personal data on Russian security forces to external individuals, including Ukrainian citizens.

Prominent members of Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) leadership have also allegedly been dismissed or detained.

The Kremlin may be pushing for such arrests and investigations in order to conduct an overhaul of the domestic security apparatus to oust officials who have fallen out of with the Putin regime.

""The Russians have no intention of replicating the attempts we witnessed after 24 February last year, but that does not mean the enemy is defeated or that it no longer poses a danger to Ukraine.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 20 April 2023.  


* On 18 April 2023, the Kremlin issued a press release on President Putin’s visit to Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. Using the Russian spelling of Ukraine’s Dnipro river, the release described the president as having visited the ‘Dnipr Group of Forces’.  

* This is one of the first references to the existence of a Dnipr Group of Forces (DGF). Russia uses the term ‘group of forces’ in a specific way, indicating a large, task-organised operational formation.  

* Early in the invasion, the Russian force was organised into groups of forces each aligned to their home military districts in Russia, for example, the Western and Central Groups of Forces.  

* The existence of an apparently new DGF suggest that the original force organisation has evolved, probably due to heavy losses.  

* DGF’s mission is likely to defend the southern sector of the occupied zone, and especially the south-western flank which is currently marked by the Dnipro river.

From one and a half kilometers behind us, the distance beyond the bridge is controlled by ours, and the rest is controlled by the enemy.

Plus, thanks to our stupidity, the Enemies have established a stable supply for themselves there,

they are accumulating strength, evacuating

the wounded, bringing provisions

and ammunition.

They ride boats like fucking Cuban drug lords, only there are not enough whores on boats...

- Despite Kremlin saying trip was 17 April, it was April 12-14. 

- Putin had no MOD Generals with him as entourage. 

- Sources dispute purpose:

  - Officers were being sent to the regional HQ^1 from elsewhere, Putin unexpectedly accompanied. 

  - Second reason,^2 so Putin could speak directly with the commander of the Airborne Forces, Mikhail Teplinsky, who had submitted “a detailed report on the deplorable state of the troops, Gerasimov's wrong tactical decisions, the incorrect use of air assault units, and the poor training of the mobilized, and his recommendations…[including] that the Airborne Forces and special forces units should be immediately switched from assault missions to sabotage missions in order to disrupt preparations for the Ukrainian offensive.”^3  The Report—which aggravated the already-bad relations between Gerasimov and Teplinsky—prompted the [meddlesome] Putin to talk personally with Teplinsky, after reading report 2 months ago.


  - Third reason is a second version of the same Teplinsky saga.^4  After reading Teplinsky’s report in February, but “simply for personal communication with the paratrooper general [Teplinsky], Putin would not have gone to the combat zone [Kherson]. The visit … is connected with the desire to check Gerasimov's latest proposals on the spot. The commander of the Russian grouping, Valery **Gerasimov**, according to our interlocutors, **fears that the measures he has taken to repel the Ukrainian offensive will not save the situation**. Therefore, in early April, he asked Putin for **permission to withdraw troops**—to Crimea and to the territory of the Russian Federation—if the situation completely gets out of control. Putin decided to find out the opinion of the generals [on the ground, regional HQ] who were dissatisfied with Gerasimov—especially Teplinsky—and at the same time listen to the commanders in specific areas.”

_____
^(^1) ^(The Kremlin called the meeting of the regional HQ “the Dneiper group in Genichesk” [Henichesk], and meant the Kherson and Zaporizhye occupiers—and the term surprised RF Military, as that term had not been used in open sources previously.  As explained by RF General Staff officer to *Volya*, that term had been used *within* MOD for “the remnants of the Kherson group, troops in the occupied part of the Zaporozhye region, and units assembled for the defense of Crimea. It’s their colloquial name, and their command and management structure is still being built.”)

The assumption is that the longer it takes, the stronger Russia’s defence will be.

What happens if Ukraine waits 3 months?

Ukraine will have another 3 months to get used to their new equipment.

Russia will draft more men and station them in Ukraine. These men will go from contributing to Russian Soviet to becoming a cost. They will get paid and need feeding and arming to sit a wait.

Russia will expend more shells and missiles.

Sanctions will continue to bite deeper into the Russian economy.  The central bank will start running out of tricks.

People expect Ukraine to press a button and then launch a blitzkrieg attack that retakes a ton of land and forces Russia to sue for peace but that's just not how these things usually work in large wars.

Ukraine needs to focus on taking the actions that maximize their chance for winning and I do believe they are focusing on this. Maybe that means taking a small chunk here or there, maybe it means a rapid advance where it makes sense and maybe it means slowly raiding and shaping the battlefield until Russia is forced to withdraw from a strategic area. While Ukraine is trying to win battles they also have to make sure they're not putting themselves at do great of risk of losing substantial weapons, personnel or ammo as well. Managing risk v reward and weighing the value of every action is doable but it's not easy and observers need to understand that.

The best thing those of us outside Ukraine can do is to trust that Ukrainian commanders know what they're doing, donate money to pro Ukrainian organizations and put pressure on western officials to do more.

(I should note that the site doesn’t want to be liable for putting UA troops in harms way by putting them on blast; nevertheless, they will often do something like reference it, then downplay it and say waiting for UA confirmation.)

Also, just reading this translation and not the original, but having read 1000s previously, I think he’s saying “The Ukrainians boldly and blatantly ride over here. But it’s in small boats of just a few guys, so our command doesn’t want to waste artillery on them.  We’re stuck using small arms on them.  Unless command agrees big enough to use artillery on them.  And they’re trickling in and acting like they own this place.”

And yes, UA does cross and try.^1  But “bridgehead” is almost certainly incorrect, an exaggeration.

Let’s look at how Volya analyzed his statement today:^1


> Why did the [RF] Airborne Forces suddenly start “blocking” the city? The Armed Forces of Ukraine are not going to run away from it, especially not to the north, and not to the south. The Ukrainian army has open exit routes to the west. So the blockade means hastily building defenses around the city? ‘Hastily’ because the RF paratroopers units are not intended for long-term defense and they were pulled out for this task, since there was no one else to pull out to fight there.

> If there was such a ‘hasty’ rush, then, probably, the Ukrainian reconnaissance in force—which took place the night before—demonstrated to the RF Armed Forces that they were much closer to the defeat and encirclement near Bakhmut, than to the RF’s capture of it? 

> Since [RF MOD Spokesman] Konashenkov will not answer these questions, let's try it ourselves: 

> The position of Russian troops in and around Bakhmut is indeed precarious. The UAF can, if they see fit, strike north and south, encircle the city itself, and move further east. 

> **Last night, the Armed Forces of Ukraine conducted reconnaissance in force in many places along the line of contact—from Kherson to Lugansk regions. The most successful, it seems, happened north and south of Bakhmut. The Russians, according to our Ukrainian army sources, were unable to quickly coordinate actions, called for artillery support late and, in general, were not ready to repel attacks. The [Ukrainian] reconnaissance was taken for [understood as] a full-fledged offensive, hence the RF’s perturbed reaction—setting up the Airborne Forces [RF paratroopers] as a barrier against the expected mechanized formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.**

So he does have a history of this.  This got much press and was considered a humiliation to Shoigu.  The difference is that that was video conferencing. 

Second, we know that the withdrawal from Kherson was not a call by Command.  It was reported that Surovikin requested to Gerasimov, who then had to run it up for approval of Shoigu and Putin himself.  It was subsequently approved when Surovikin guaranteed that by doing so, it would not be a humiliating rout like Kharkiv with losing men and equipment, and second, it would allow to concentrate forces in the East and could then gain ground when not spread thin. [That did not pan out, and Surovikin is no longer commander of the campaign.] But it shows that withdrawal requires approval of Putin.

Third, while it seems uncharacteristic during this war, it *is* true that *in Russia*, when Putin has received credible information (like a draft of recommendations) which conflicts his trusted advisors, he seems initially to ignore the disputing information, but when time bears evidence, he takes a visit. This happens with Putin visiting military production facilities.  Or other necessary manufacturing complexes.  

If it *is* the case that Putin is considering Gerasimov’s request to retreat to Crimea—because if spread too thin, then can’t defend Crimea—*and* Putin is resistant to that idea—then it would be likely that he’d seek input from field marshals.

However, all this ignores why Putin could just have another teleconference.  I wonder if there’s belief/fear/evidence that it can’t be secured down in the occupied territories. . .

Edit:  I have seen other sources with Russian contacts (opposition Russian, and one ukrainian which operates behind enemy lines) write that there is panic & obsession in RF military brass about Ukrainian offensive.  That they don’t have a clear understanding of what’s in store, and they’re not being given contingency plans.  However, the Russians are ‘stocking up’ like it’s going to be a fierce blowout.

Russia has reinforced both, but Luhansk is far harder to defend and provides more choices and opportunities for Ukrainian advance and possible breakthrough. Even making gains in well fortified Donetsk looks more attainable at the moment to me.

Actually entering and liberating Crimea looks like a pretty big long shot right now - the problem being that Ukraine lacks amphibious landing capabilities of the scale necessary to advance anywhere except across the Isthmus of Perekop, while Russia has been building defensive fortifications across the isthmus since 2014, and accelerated construction in the last 6 months or so.

The best chance for Ukraine to retake the peninsula is likely to reduce Russian resupply to the area by cutting the overland supply lines they secured in 2022 with a southern offensive, striking the Kerch bridge to disrupt that supply line, and apply a bit of pressure so Russia consumes materiel faster than they can resupply. Then just wait them out until their resupply situation becomes so dire and untenable that they're forced to withdraw.

That's a pretty long term play though - it took 3 or 4 months to push them into retreat from Kherson, and that was a much smaller area with much more tenuous supply lines. An actual frontal assault into Crimea seems far too costly in terms of lives and hard-won western armaments with a significantly high risk of failure, which could be disastrous for Ukraine's foreign relations and support.",False,1681999043.0,t3_12slbap,t1_jgznuko,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Europe cares because an expanded Russia that has been rewarded for their war of aggression is bad for their security. The US, and others, care because Russia winning might embolden China to try and take Taiwan in the future. That's all in addition to bleeding the Russians.

Yes Ukraine is dependent on support but there are a lot of reasons beyond just bleeding the Russians that many countries care about Ukraine winning the war.

Any concession to Putin/Russia will only prolong the war, and accepting territorial loss will only serve to legitimize Putin's invasion or his ""historical claims"" regarding Ukrainian territory, f/ex: Crimea. Putin will see any break in the action as an opportunity to regroup and rearm.

In theory, compromise would involve both Russia and Ukraine making concessions that are acceptable to both. From the start this is a flawed perspective, as only one side will be asked to cede territory. 

Further, if Russia ultimately agreed to ""give up their claims"" regarding Ukrainian territory, they will try to frame this as a compromise position. However, as these Russian claims were groundless and unjustified to begin with, they should not be viewed as a concession on their part.

And

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to continue congressional authorization for the use of military force in the global fight against terror, turning back an effort by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to repeal the 2001 measure.

Senators rejected the amendment 86-9 as they are debating a separate repeal of two authorizations of military force in Iraq. There is broad bipartisan support to withdraw that congressional approval granted in 1991 and 2002 for military strikes against Saddam Hussein’s regime.



There are a lot of reasons to not like Rand Paul but foreign policy his opinion is kind of everytime America tries to fix something we leave it in bad shape and shortly after we are done its worse after.  We shouldn't fight everyone's battles.

No one knows, but it is obvious it is not guaranteed given the inadequate (compared to the scale of the task) military support.

My read is the opening moves have started but that could last days or months before they try to punch through.

7396ffbb5a3824d6040de9055b18a4b3,12slbap,jh0qyz1,"All of WW2 as a collective whole: yes, almost certainly. Even the Red Army as the worst performing individual force in WW2 had something like 2:1 ratios in combat deaths and 3:1 in all service deaths.

The USSR's Red Army of WW2 during the most intense periods of combat: no, probably not. Plenty of major battles and offensives saw massive casualty rates with almost all casualties being either walking wounded or killed with few in intermediate categories.

I'll try and give you some clear, independent assessments of Russia's abysmal wounded to killed ratio when I have sufficient time to go dig them out, but a couple of key points to make first:

+ Russia's medical equipment for infantry is sorely lacking in this war. Even well equipped troops during the first months were being taken prisoner carrying Soviet-era bandages with 1970s and 1980s date codes. Most did not carry tourniquets and those that did were using really old style rubber ones that require a second person to apply them, a far cry from the modern CAT type that Ukraine and other armies use, which can be self applied with one hand. They also were being issued less than one per person, where Ukraine was seemingly issuing CATs in packs of one per limb plus a fifth spare. There are a plethora of videos showing deceased Russian soldiers, bled out, with rubber tourniquets insufficiently tensioned or poorly applied. I won't link any of them here, but I could if you want. Many parts of Russia's casualty survival system follow similarly ineffective practices, including a lack of medevac/casevac flights or vehicles, and a lack of treatment facilities close to the frontlines.

+ Ukraine's tactics in this war have been high-lethality, with drones, ATGMs, and guided artillery all used very effectively, especially against Russian armoured vehicles and soft skin vehicles. There are a very large number of APCs documented destroyed with a full complement of troops inside. Same goes for artillery strikes and guided MLRS, both of which Ukraine uses and Russia does not. Russian artillery uses saturation techniques which tend to leave a large number of wounded (including seriously wounded) from a sheer volume of indirect hits, and a few kills from serious shrapnel wounds plus a proportion of perfect hits. Guided artillery tends to leave far fewer wounded because it hits what it's aimed at almost all of the time.

Even if nothing else, these two points alone substantially shift the nature of Russian wounded over previous conflicts. Weaponry is more effective at killing than ever (and getting a higher proportion of clean, direct kills), and yet Russia's first aid and trauma treatment is sorely lacking compared to other similar armies, and even compared to its historical self.",False,1682002657.0,t3_12slbap,t1_jh01wcf,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Both are obviously biased. Ukraine's figures arguably less so, and they're generally claiming killed to wounded is roughly parity. Any other sources, like my own assessment, are basically reliant on metadata and analysis of contributing factors.

For what it's worth, the majority of wounded in WW1 were not wounded in combat, many of them from things that are now easily preventable and treatable today, especially infections and complications of more minor injuries. War poet Rupert Brooke for example, despite the enthusiastic patriotism in his work, never actually saw combat as he died from complications of a mosquito bite (!) before even reaching the front line.

Even WW2 had better battlefield medicine than a lot of media portrayals make out, units definitely had medics with tourniquets, bandages, painkillers, trauma kits.

What's definitely changed about modern warfare is remarkably similar to what's happened with car safety. The middle group of serious injuries is really becoming squeezed with better safety equipment. You're either mildly injured or dead, very rarely in between. As an old engineer friend put it: ""You're less likely to be fucked up, but when you're fucked up you're really fucked up"".

That's exactly what's happening in modern combat and it's a problem for all armies, not a problem unique to Russia. Your body armour and Kevlar helmet make a lot of things that would have led to serious injuries and possible death in hospital weeks later, into things you walk away from because there's no penetration. On the other hand, the things that do punch through the body armour you aren't getting back up from.

That's exactly what we're seeing here, and it's applicable to both sides. Combat injuries are basically split into ""You have a minor ouchie, soldier, back to your unit"" and ""Private Gonzalez is now a meat paste, sir!"". Fewer things are combat ending injuries but those that are more commonly lead to death.

Fun fact, when Australia made wearing a bike helmet mandatory, the number of cyclists admitted to hospital actually went up. That change made crashes way more survivable. This is that but to the extreme. We've made so many things in combat so survivable that the majority of injuries we can't prevent are now the fatal ones, and from things like artillery rather than small arms fire.",False,1682011131.0,t3_12slbap,t1_jh0sn85,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

I mean you just pulled that out of your ass, because not exporting medicine does not equal ""kill all children"". They have their own, they can produce their own. All it does is put additional strain on their resources. You're not becoming Russian with that. You become Russian if you send missiles, drones and army to kill, rape and destroy. 

It's a moot point anyway. No one will stop humanitarian and other types of aid to Russia just because of me wishing. You guys view the common Russian as a victim of ""Putin's war"".
