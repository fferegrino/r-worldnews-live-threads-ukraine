>  
>Most probably 🇷🇺 military command did change, this careful style of fighting is due to new commanders. 🇷🇺 General died, while leading VDV (airborne forces) in battle, which normally wouldn’t be needed, as they are highly motivated. There have been numerous cases of 🇷🇺 solders attacking, firing, or driving over commanding officers with tanks. 🇷🇺 does not have disciplinary solution, can’t make discipline even stronger, possibly attempting paradigm change – proving that the new command really cares about soldier’s lives. With previous command, 🇷🇺 would have certainly launched an attack by now given how many forces they’ve accumulated.  
>  
>Zaporozhye: 🇷🇺 dug in a battalion (30) of T62 tanks, using them as checkpoints, relocating part of forces away, possibly to Kherson area, because 🇷🇺 is not doing well there. Kherson: 🇺🇦 established a foothold near Davydiv Brid, repelled multiple 🇷🇺 attacks, now 🇺🇦 advanced even further. 🇷🇺 lost approximately 1 BTG. Also, 🇷🇺 has concentrated all the forces from surrounding area of 150-20km fat Popasna. Such relocation of forces hasn’t happened before. It means, that 🇷🇺 can’t complete main objectives without significant relocation.  
>  
>Even if 🇷🇺 now wins in the East (which is unlikely), their forces would need to retreat, and do serious replenishing afterwards, which would take very long time (and allow 🇺🇦 to get more weapons). This is only hypothesis at the moment, but has at least 2 proofs (transfer of forces in 2 locations). If this is true, and 🇷🇺 is unable to attack without concentrating forces, they lost war tempo even before lend-lease arrived. Conclusion: either 🇷🇺 seriously started saving lives of their troops, or waiting is for reinforcements, which also implies 1st reason. Either case, it’s a good sign for 🇺🇦.

From CNN’s Mariya Knight

A ""Book of Torturers"" documenting ""war criminals and criminals from the Russian army"" will be launched in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his nightly address on Tuesday.

""These are specific facts about specific people who are guilty of specific violent crimes against Ukrainians,"" he said.

“And such a ‘Book of Torturers’ is one of the foundations of the responsibility of not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes — soldiers of the occupying army, but also their commanders. Those who gave orders. Those who made possible everything they did in Ukraine. In Bucha, in Mariupol, in all our cities, in all the communities they have reached.""

The creation of this system has been underway for some time, Zelensky added.

Some context: Last month, a 21-year-old Russian soldier was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed man in Ukraine's first war crimes trial since Russia's invasion began.

The trial came amid mounting evidence of alleged Russian war crimes as Ukrainians reclaimed areas previously occupied by invading troops.

In April, Ukraine's prosecutor general said her office was investigating nearly 6,000 cases of alleged Russian war crimes, with ""more and more"" proceedings opening every day.

From CNN’s Matt Egan

US President Joe Biden's administration has issued new investment restrictions that prohibit Americans from buying Russian stocks and bonds.

The ban is the latest step by US officials to crank up the financial pressure on Russia in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.  

According to new guidance issued Monday by the Treasury Department, US investors are prohibited from buying “both new and existing debt and equity securities issued by an entity in the Russian Federation.”

Up until now, Americans were able to buy Russian stocks and bonds that change hands in secondary markets. 

Americans will still be allowed to sell Russian stocks and bonds, although only to a “non-US person,” the Treasury said. Americans are not “required” to divest Russian securities and may continue to hold them, according to the guidance. 

And US investors can also still invest in US funds that own Russian securities, as long as those Russian holdings are not the bulk of the fund’s assets. ",False,1654700598.0,t3_v7gbn3,t3_v7gbn3,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

*(...)*

*Ukraine continues to draw fresh reserves to Sievierodonetsk, which includes International Legion troops, regular Armed Forces, and National Guards units.*  
  
*Both sides are exhausted, even though Russia has made capturing Sievierodonetsk a top priority. According to Ukraine’s command, Russia has committed close to 50% of its overall combat force in Ukraine, close to 100 battalion tactical groups, to the Sievierodonetsk-Lysychansk area.*   
  
*Meanwhile, Russia has struggled to collect high-quality reserves and has had to abandon its stalled axes in Zaporizhia Oblast and Izium. According to international monitors, Russia’s progress in the area has already been very costly, and its forces have already consumed much of their overall ability to continue with offensive operations.*   
  
*Russia’s drive in Donbas has gradually run out of steam over the last several days.*   
  
*“The ability of Ukrainian forces to successfully counterattack in Sievierodonetsk, the Kremlin’s current priority area of operations, further indicates the declining combat power of Russian forces in Ukraine,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based defense think tank, concluded on June 5.*

Ukraine and the West accuse Moscow of weaponising food supplies. Russia says Ukrainian mines laid at sea and Western sanctions imposed on Moscow are to blame.

Day 105 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today’s shelling was probably even worse than the one yesterday, at least it was worse in my district. At about 11pm we heard some extremely loud explosions, basically the same ones as when my building got directly hit by an MLRS rocket. Many districts were shelled today and many fires started, I’m pretty sure one fire started very close to me, as there was pretty strong smell of smoke in the air. 

Judging by the sound, those explosions happened less than 100 meters away from me this time. The whole building was also shaking pretty bad. Actually one of the shells/rockets might have even hit another part of my apartment building, but I’m not sure yet. There were people patrolling the streets with flashlights, looking for places of impact, so we were definitely shelled, it wasn’t some distant sound. 

And that loud sound from yesterday turned out to be from an Iskander missile hitting yet another supermarket, a very worthy target for a missile that costs millions of dollars. And what did Russians say about it? They said that they hit a tank factory, where vehicles were getting repaired. Those must be some invisible tanks, as we even have the footage from the inside of the supermarket (and from multiple angles) during the moment of impact, and there were no tanks or other vehicles anywhere in it.

While a lot of people have already returned, the shelling that happens every day won’t let anyone live peacefully here. A lot of businesses were either destroyed by shelling (and more are being destroyed every day), were closed or relocated somewhere else, so a lot (if not the majority) of people lost their jobs, unless they were WFH. 

Some people living here are saying that the situation with work is so bad, that you can’t even get a job as a janitor without connections. The situation probably won’t get any better until the war ends, as we will always be in range of almost all Russian MLRS and some regular artillery like Pion.",False,1654741885.0,t3_v7gbn3,t3_v7gbn3,,0,69,0,69,0,0,

The US has taken command of the Russian-owned superyacht in Fiji and sailed it away from the South Pacific nation after winning a legal battle on Tuesday to seize the $325m vessel.

Fiji’s Supreme Court lifted a stay order which had prevented the US from seizing the superyacht Amadea. The US removed the motorised vessel within an hour or two of the court’s ruling, possibly to ensure the yacht didn’t get entangled in any further legal action.

Anthony Coley, a spokesman for the US Justice Department, said on Twitter that the superyacht had set sail for the US under a new flag, and that American authorities were grateful to police and prosecutors in Fiji “whose perseverance and dedication to the rule of law made this action possible”.

The court ruling represents a significant victory for the US as it encounters obstacles in its attempts to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs around the world.

The besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol could now be facing a deadly cholera outbreak, NBC News reported, citing local officials.

Drinking water in the city has been contaminated by decomposing garbage and corpses, increasing the risk of a cholera outbreak, NBC reported, citing an advisor to the occupied city’s mayor.

The advisor, Petro Andryushchenko, also added that a nearby Russian city across the border was preparing infectious disease units in case a cholera outbreak might affect Russian soldiers in Mariupol, NBC News reported.

“So really, this threat is not only recognized by the World Health Organization and us, but the occupants as well,” Andryushchenko said on Ukrainian television, according to NBC News.

He said in a different interview that Russian authorities controlling Mariupol were effectively shutting down the city and imposing a self-imposed quarantine.

NBC News and CNBC could not independently confirm Andryushchenko’s claim.

Cholera can kill within hours if left untreated, according to the WHO.

The organization last month warned of the threat of infectious disease outbreaks in Mariupol, citing local nongovernmental organizations that the city’s sewage and drinking water were getting mixed, creating “a huge hazard for many infections, including cholera.”

From CNN’s Niamh Kennedy in London  

Food has become part of Russia's “arsenal of terror,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.  

In an address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, von der Leyen stressed the urgent need to restore Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, as a remedy to the looming global food crisis.

“This is a cold, callous and calculated siege by Putin on some of the most vulnerable countries and people in the world. And therefore now, Honorable Members, food has become now part of the Kremlin's arsenal of terror, and we cannot tolerate it,” von der Leyen told EU lawmakers.  

The EU’s sanctions against Russia “do not touch basic food commodities,” the EU Commission chief stressed.  

“They do not affect the trading of grain or other foods between Russia and third countries. And the port embargo specifically has full exemption on agricultural goods,” she added, highlighting the need to counter Russian ""disinformation"" about the food crisis.  

Her remarks come as Russian and Turkish foreign ministers held meetings in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss issues related to grain exports from Ukraine.

Von der Leyen thanked the United Nations for its “efforts” to help restore Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, reiterating that the “majority of Ukrainian grain can only be exported” through these routes. 

There is an expectation for the EU to show the “same solidarity” it has “shown to Ukraine when it comes to addressing the food crisis in the world,” she added, committing the bloc to this task.  ",False,1654691835.0,t3_v7gbn3,t3_v7gbn3,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

From CNN’s Hannah Ritchie and Josh Pennington

Around 600 people are “being held hostage” in “rooms outfitted as torture chambers” and “pre-trial detention” facilities in the Russian-occupied Kherson region, according to a Ukrainian official.

Of the 600, half are “being held hostage in the Kherson regional state administration building, in a pre-trial detention center, and in vocational school No. 17 in the city of Henichesk,” said Tamila Tasheva, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's representative to Crimea, said during a televised address Tuesday, citing government agencies and activists who recently fled the occupied territory. 

CNN cannot independently verify Tasheva’s claim and has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for a response to the allegations. 

Those being held were described by Tasheva as “civilian hostages, activists, journalists and military prisoners of war (POWs),” some of whom she claimed have been taken from Kherson to Simferopol -- the second largest city in Russian-occupied Crimea. 

Nearly all of Kherson -- located in southern Ukraine -- has been occupied by Russia since its invasion in late February. 

Ukrainian officials estimate at least half the civilian population of Kherson has left the region during the war. 

In late May, the Russian-installed administration in Kherson officially closed the region's boundaries to surrounding Ukrainian government-controlled areas. 

The move came after exit points from Kherson had already been unofficially blocked for weeks, according to Ukrainian officials, who alleged that anyone wanting to leave the region was being sent to Crimea.

Now that I've hopefully dealt with any knee-jerk reactions from people that I'm ""anti Ukrainian"" or a ""shill"" or other such nonsense for what I'm about to say I'll continue.

&#x200B;

There seems to be a very concerning echo chamber developing in the comments section of reddit/twitter/other social medias that the Russian army is just completely in shambles and that Ukrainian victory is all but assured in the long run. This couldn't be further from the truth and in fact has it's own inherent dangers when reality doesn't follow this narrative over the following months.

Firstly some facts i think (hopefully) we can all agree on based on what we've seen so far :

1. The Russian army has under performed relative to the expectations the vast majority of analysts had prior to the beginning of the invasion.
2. The Ukrainians have by and large exceeded the expectations that the majority of analysts had prior to the commencement of the war.
3. The western response was more unified initially than most people expected, and by and large has remained so to this point.

&#x200B;

The danger I see illustrated above is that it's not a big stretch to expect the Russian forces to address some issues, and slowly over time reduce the extent to which it's under performing. Corruption will be addressed (Clarification : in some small way, not even close to entirely!) and shortfalls will be mitigated to varying degrees. Conversely as the Russians better understand the Ukrainian tactics, Ukrainian Materiel gets depleted faster that it's being replenished (which is accurate at the moment) and potential moral issues within the Ukrainian army increase due to attrition their initial advantage and over performance could reduce as things settle in. I'm not seeing this reality reflected in western media or discussion though, there is still a constant narrative that the Russian army is in shambles and being routinely defeated by the Ukrainians in engagements, which unfortunately is not true.

I'm constantly reading about the deployment of M777 howitzers, German PzH 2000 artillery, Caeser 155mm systems, united states MLRS systems and what a ""game changer"" this is going to be without any real acknowledgement of just how FEW of these systems are being delivered/pledged/promised. The actual amounts being offered with the amount needed are orders of magnitudes apart from each other, yet this fact appears to be ""unpopular"" and downvoted or shunned when ever it is pointed out, despite it being hard military fact. 4 Himars systems being sent to Ukraine is such a tiny drop in the ocean compared to what is needed that it's almost purely a symbolic and political gesture rather than a practical one.

The standout here in opposition to the other countries is Poland, they've provided by and far more equipment and support for Ukraine than any other country (per capita) by a long LONG way, and luckily for Ukraine Poland has the ear of NATO and to a lessor extent the EU due to it's extreme strategic importance to both entities.

Realistically to be combat effective somewhere in excess of 100 Himars systems would be needed make a meaningful difference, the same with the 7 PzH 2000 systems being sent. Germany has around 180 of these systems.  They're sending 7. If the true goal is to have Ukraine win this war, or at least make it so uncomfortable for Russian that they are forced to the negotiations table under duress then this simple doesn't cut it. So far France has sent 6 howitzers, 6.

I'm not attempting to belittle the efforts made so far, I'm just attempting to point out that functionally these are not even close the the amounts needed to actually turn the tide of the war, yet the social media narrative is that Russia is going to be in so much pain with these new weapons arriving. This whole war revolved around western resolve, western ability to take some pain and hardship  (economically) without faltering and it's ability the *effectively* equip Ukraine with enough to win the engagement. I'm not so sure that this is a given. Comments made by the French and Germain leadership already shows signs of testing the political waters of a not so hard-line approach to Russian aggression, combined with an apparent distinct lack of stomach for absorbing much more economic hardship on the home front.

What this means :

Ukraine could still very much lose this war. It's absolutely not a given that Russia will capitulate or be forced to the negotiation table. It's very much in the hand of western resolve, political will and ability to live with some hardships locally and globally to keep the appropriate amount of pressure on Russia, and supply Ukraine with the required materiel for conduct and effective defence. This is not reflected in the overwhelming narrative/memes/public opinion i see online currently and it's very concerning.

&#x200B;

Happy to civilly discuss any of the above with anyone at length and as always counter points are very welcome.

Usually they are closely linked but in this case it is a supply  issue that is causing shortages, *consumption is not increasing* and in fact is being driven down, if anything, and the phasing out of fossil fuels is being accelerated.

In the medium term to push for more extraction and the reduction of consumption will have a negative effect on prices (and push demand for more storage) which will probably result in a faster closing of sources. With major powers like US, EU and China looking at reducing their strategic vulnerability by increasing domestic production while simultaneously reducing consumption it will be ""Gas Station"" producers like the gulf states and Russia who will be impacted first and hardest.

Increased production does have some environmental risks: damage to environments by new extraction and pipelines as well as the possible risk of fossil fuel dumping (nightmare scenario, Russia decides to open its gas valves to release fuel it cannot sell and does not want to cut back on producing). Also a major glut in fossil fuel storage and price crash could lead to to some consumers temporarily slowing their commitments to fossil fuel replacement.",False,1654703073.0,t3_v7gbn3,t1_ibloepr,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Zudem muss die Software der Raketenwerfer zunächst umprogrammiert werden, weil die deutschen Fahrzeuge bislang keine Munition aus den USA oder aus Großbritannien verschießen können.

The problem is that fewer than half of the nearly 40 German vehicles are currently operational, according to Business Insider.

In addition, the software of the missile launchers must first be reprogrammed because the German vehicles cannot fire ammunition from the U.S. or the U.K. so far.

By far the fastest method is to take the already trained Ukrainian artillery guys and technicians, who until now worked with older Soviet equipment, and give them some training in Poland or in the USA or wherever. But the country is actually fighting a bloody war right now, so it can't just send bulk of its force for retraining abroad. It can only rotate out reasonably sized chunks, say 2-3 per cent, at a time, without compromising its fighting capability.

Ukrainians are dying: both soldiers and civilians. There's absolutely no doubt about that. But why would this lead to moral issues in the Ukrainian forces?

EDIT: Do you mean morale issues? The Ukrainians may get scared, but we'll send more help along the way. We'll support them how we can, as long as they're willing to fight. There seems to be a plan to constantly improve the weapons we send over to them to help keep morale up over the long term. It started with Javelins. Then we escalated to drones. Then M777 guns. And now we're reaching very large HIMARS rockets. Each step up renews the Ukrainian morale and reminds them that more surprises are coming to help them out.

> I'm constantly reading about the deployment of M777 howitzers, German PzH 2000 artillery, Caeser 155mm systems

Yes. Over 150 of them delivered. They're all compatible with the same 155mm ammo, and the USA is sending 200,000+ rounds of 155mm ammo alone, and all of those 155mm guns can use all of those rounds. Also add M109 systems. I don't know who sent them, but I've seen Ukrainians using them on video as well.

> So far France has sent 6 howitzers, 6.

And those 6 guns France sent have destroyed 80 Russian guns. Because those CAESAR systems are either #1 or #2 best system in the world.

> Realistically to be combat effective somewhere in excess of 100 Himars systems would be needed make a meaningful difference, the same with the 7 PzH 2000 systems being sent.

Each HIMARS system shoots 6 of these babies at the enemy. And each one lands within 5-meters of the intended target: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5h7BkCj5rI

The HIMARS system reloads in just 5 minutes, and can fire another 6 shots after that.

I'm pretty sure that even just 1 HIMARS system will make a big difference where its deployed.

Pzh 2000 is an **armored howitzer**, meaning it can take enemy artillery fire. Especially the inefficient artillery fire that the Russians are known (a shot off by 50-meters would kill an unarmored crew, or damage the rubber tires of even the CAESAR system). But Pzh 2000 is armored, it can take a near-miss (50-meter away) explosion.

The ""bulk"" of 155mm artillery is the 108+ M777 guns that USA / Australia / Canada gave.

This is true in the very theoretical sense, for the conventional phase of the conflict (remember, we were all preparing in the first 2 weeks for a possible insurgency spearheaded by Volodymyr ""I need ammo"" Zelensky). Like, something really goes horribly wrong that we did not know about, or Zelensky is suddenly willing to cede territory (which would be strange).

While we should prepare for such a possibility of an unexpected breakdown...I do believe that that should be kept in mind. If Ukraine suddenly buckles hard, it wasn't because of anything we really knew *right now.*

>Ukraine needs like 100 HIMARS and 300 M777s, not the numbers they have now.

You're correct that this is basically the case. Ukrainians love these things, and they are performing the way we hoped.

There was a claim that American ships are on the way with deliveries that could have the numbers that could seriously impact the war, but we'll ultimately have to see.

They just need a lot more of them, and the news should be ""These things work the way we want, they are learning how to use them very quickly and eagerly, and are putting them to very good use. Now is the time to hurry up,"" not that a pivot point has been reached with 4 HIMARS touching down on the airstrip.

This is important for confirming the pre-requisite; that they can use them, and use them well. I do think that's worth stating. Ukrainians are saying ""We needed to fire 10 rounds before finally scoring a hit, and we can do that in 2 with the M777."" That's pretty great.

One thing that should be noted, is that in these circumstances...getting a country like Russia to quit being poopy-heads could take a lot of damage and a lot of time. They are absolutely vulnerable...and it could be that the process for getting them to the negotiating table or pushing them back is a multi-year long affair. In fact, that's probably going to be the case.

Yes a few of Russian conscripts have been found fighting in Ukraine but they are a very small part of the Russian forces there.

Meanwhile Ukraine has tens of thousands if not maybe a couple hundred thousand soldiers that will be finishing their training in the next few months. Even if Russia started drafting more tomorrow if they want to do any training at all they won't be ready to fight until months from now.

Yes Russia could fully mobilize more troops than Ukraine, get industry to at least make them some basic modern kit, give them some decent training and just overwhelm Ukraine with sheer numbers but they haven't done that yet.

I'd like to point out a few other things you may not have considered.

NB: I went on a bit of a ramble, sorry.

The first and foremost is that 'most analysts' (at least in a military context) are garbage outside their niche or are just regurgitating the same thing as everyone else, well at least the ones a majority of the media were interviewing on this subject, and indeed many other subjects over the years.

There's a very, very big difference between a scientist specialising on a particular field and an analyst. Yet in the media they are given the same weight on their respective subjects.

By giving so much air time to unqualified or misinformed opinions, they just keep recycling the same old narratives. In this context it's even more difficult because we don't get to see confirmation of military qualities or lack thereof for each nation very often.

And the media likes to perpetuate a narrative. In this sense it was the 3 day war.

Their interpretation was it would be all over for Ukraine in no time, largely because they saw Crimea, Donbas and Luhansk fell that way.

But Ukraine just spent 8 years preparing for this, had comparable numbers of troops (biases defence) and on home soil. At worst, Russia would get large chunks of Eastern Ukraine and then fight an intense insurgency for years... It never brought anywhere near enough troops to hold the sort of territory they hoped to capture. The expectation was the setup of a puppet in Kyiv (by Russia) - that was questionable at best without some sort of SF/assassination of Zelenskyy, and even then probably wouldn't have played out well.

Kyiv is a sprawling metropolis with many possible lines of supply, Russia was never blitzing it with conventional troops in those numbers.

But how much focus in the media did you hear in the opening weeks about the likelihood of insurgency or inability or Russia to effectively hold the ground it gains?


The media has continued with this sort of false narrative. Currently the story is 'The war has become largely stagnant/static'. That's simply not true, we haven't even been going for 4 months left, but saying it's stagnant ignores the entire Kherson Oblast.

We also know that Ukraine is beginning to finally see the results of her mobilisation (the 700k troops begin arriving soon) and western heavy arms.

Ukraine has said they will be conducting offensives this summer. They've been largely running defence-in-depth (another thing all these so called analysts don't even understand - despite it being a relatively simply military strategy) and they've done it remarkably well.

I'd be waiting until the end of this coming winter before calling anything static, or even writing up Russia as having a 'chance' of holding their stated goals (remember, these are drastically smaller than before - when they wanted all of Ukraine 'demilitarised').

Even if Russia mobilises tomorrow, there's a huge time-lag on that and there's no indication they even have the equipment, logisitics, training infrastructure or command and control to conduct said mobilisation, which is a major reason why they haven't.


Subsequently; the question is how much Ukraine takes back when she does decide to apply a concentration of force - we'll have an idea by the end of August, and then will get a better idea during round 2 in winter once the ground has frozen after Rasputitsa part 2.

This war does not become static until at least the end of next winter, then we will know how much Russia has lost. But how much Ukraine pays for it - that is the key question.

Russia has geopolitically, economically and strategically already lost, they just keep adjusting the goalposts to redefine 'success'.",False,1654679731.0,t3_v7gbn3,t1_ibks6g6,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

And at the moment Zelensky and his inner circle have such tight control of the money from donors for the military that it is also getting where it needs to go.

And it makes sense that even corrupt people do realize there are lines they can't cross, Ukraine is fighting a war for its existence and you might literally find yourself up on charges of high treason for misappropriating military equipment or funding. If there was one time in Ukrainian history you don't want to get caught with your hand in the cookie jar it is right now.

And you can't really compare it to the corruption the west saw in trying to fund the Afghan military, people in Ukraine actually believe in Ukraine as a country and are united against Russia. In Afghanistan most people there don't really believe in the concept of Afghanistan as a country, they only really care about their tribe, town and family. So they were not willing to fight for the country and therefore didn't care if the military was a joke or people stole from it, just look how fast they collapsed when foreign troops left. As a contrast Ukrainian's have obviously proven they are willing to fight for their country and that the military equipment get's where it needs to go. They are united in way that the Afghan people never were. And although slow when you look at reported corruption levels in Ukraine they are slowly getting better, it hasn't been quick but it's measurable.

And countries can turn around corruption more quickly than you might think sometimes, the Baltic states were plagued by corruption as well but needing to clean things up to join NATO and the EU they now rank among the least corrupt nations in the world. Change can be made, this war as sad as it is might be what gives Ukraine the chance to rid itself of the worst of it.

Personally I far more worry about money given them to assist in rebuilding after what is hopefully a Ukrainian victory where they get most if not all of their territory back. Billions pouring into the country to rebuild bridges, apartment buildings, houses and other infrastructure is ripe for the kind of graft that Ukraine has an issue with. For now I am not so worried about military donations or money for purchasing arms getting stolen as they seem to have a handle on it.

Edit: Plus what is the alternative to supporting Ukraine anyway? Let them have Ukraine and then who knows what they go for next, the rest of Georgia? Moldova? It's clear they're not going to stop invading their neighbors unless they are forced too so for better or worse we need to support Ukraine.",1654706605.0,1654706179.0,t3_v7gbn3,t1_ibmdcfl,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

9aede510ca090c0631ef306394a340c4,v7gbn3,ibo6cvg,"I remember there was talk that ukraine may be under counting deaths back in april. This is because Ukraine can't appear too succesful or they might not get the western weapons they need to drive russia out.

Interestingly enough, I also heard another report that there may be far less Russian wounded vs kills than in western/modern wars. This is because modern weapons like javelins and stugna-Ps and such are so lethal that the Russians just die instead of being wounded. Also, it is because Russia has [terrible medical logistics](https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1501723810629922823) so their wounded just die. 

Both these things mean Ukraine has far more incentive to lie about numbers downward. If the Ukraine War has high lethality weapons, and Russia specifically has poor medical care, that doesn't leave a lot of wounded. It means Russian total casualties, deaths and wounded together, are lower because most of the wounded die. In the west way more soldiers would simply be knocked out of combat for several months but still count as casualties. 

This means that instead of Russia losing say, 90,000 men because 30,000 are dead and 60,000 thousand are injured. Russia may have lost 50,000 men as casualties and because of poor medical care and logistics and high lethality weapons, 40,000 are dead, and only 10,000 are wounded. Obviously these numbers are hypothetical. 

This incentivizes Ukraine to lie downward about kills because total casualties are lower for Russia even with the high deaths, than Russia still has more troops available than normal KIA to Wounded ratio. And also because Ukraine can't appear too successful if they want more weapons. 

I also think this is why Arestovych appears as such a Flip-Flopper. He needs Ukraine to seem threatened and about to lose. Then they get Spare parts for Migs/Tanks/155mm Arty/HIMARS and suddenly it's like hey we're doing good. Then suddenly they need a new weapon and hey, Russia is winning and pushing us back, give us ""insert western weapon of doom that will totally win the war till we need the next one.""

It's not. The war has changed, so too must the Ukrainian strategy. 

Allowing Russia to overextend worked wonderfully when they zerged Kyiv, but now they've moved into a more creeping offensive. In that sort of situation hitting supply lines is only marginally useful because the 'Z's are taking great care not to overextend. They advance a few kilometers each day, setup supply dumps, and repair critical infrastructure behind the front. There's no tanks or trucks to run out of fuel now. There's only artillery and ammunition. 

However, Severodonetsk is uniquely indefensible. It's open on three sides and sits at the nadir of a valley. 

In contrast Lysychansk is a fucking bastion as long as the supply lines remain intact, which they will while Russia's Popoansa thrust remains stalled. And Russia already knows there's no chance of a breakthrough there or else that's where they'd be concentrating their forces. Instead they've gather one-hundred of whatever the fuck passes for their BTGs nowadays and are slamming them against entrenched positions. 

Ukraine has the high ground; they have a defensible city situated behind a river; they have a redoubt in the North-West corner of Severodonetsk resistant to artillery strikes from which to sally. Meanwhile, the enemy cannot bring to bear the full force of their artillery (friendly fire), their armor (urban environment), or their air-force (S-300s on the other side of the river), and so must make due with conscript bayonet charges.

I also said a week ago that if Ukraine can hold Severodonetsk, it will deal a major blow to the Russian offensive.

We're approaching that timeframe now. Every day Ukraine's chances of holding Severodonetsk increase, and what makes it even better is that even if they fully withdrew from there today, it wouldn't even remotely harm their strategic positioning.

Within a week, I think Ukraine will still be holding Severodonetsk, and within 2-4 weeks the Russian front will collapse and regroup in a tighter defensive formation (my guess is Luhansk, Melitopol, Crimea and Donetsk areas).

I don't agree with the way you're presenting this.

The world is doing both. There's a ton of investment in renewables, but it's also heavily supply constrained at every piece of the puzzle - raw materials, production capacity, installations, other associated infrastructure on the power grid side, etc. 

And while we're scaling those things up about as rapidly as possible, the massive size of the problem (coupled with increasing global energy demand) means that you can't really only do that.

Probably not. The bet that's being made is that Russia is going to remain a pariah and partially or entirely locked out of world oil markets (*especially* if other oil is available) for at least the medium term. That's a massive amount of oil production that's taken out of the picture and needs replacement to keep the world functioning - even if renewables start to actually reduce oil demand from current levels.

Add to that the fact that the coalition parties don't agree when it comes to heavy weapons.

Germany could have just sent 100 Marder IFVs and be done with it. But the Marder is too much of an offensive weapon. Instead our Secretary of Defense jumps in front of the camera any time pressure from the public, coalition partners and the opposition becomes too much and presents some half-assed, last-minute plan. Like the Gepard: perfect because it's heavy, but it's for air defense, so it's still a defensive weapon. Let's send them that.

>I think you drastically over-estimate the ability at which you can fundamentally re-build a large organisation. That process takes years to plan, execute and bed down through training and drill. The idea you can do it while under fire and in a massively diminished and demoralized force is unrealistic. There'll be some adaptation, sure, but that's as likely to be soldiers trying to escape their contracts. It's also not a force that rewards initiative at the low level, and the leadership is going to be under massive pressure to deliver.

I'm not talking about rebuilding, I'm talking about necessary adaption to meet the needs of the situation, which armies throughout history have shown and ability to do. I agree there are fundamental issues with the Russian military that need to be addressed to be on par with western forces, that doesn't stop them from being effective ***enough*** to still achieve their goal in Ukraine if western resolve falters though. 

>On the current trajectory Russia will lose. They didn't really have the manpower to subjugate the country with their initial force, and much of that force is spent. There could still be a sudden collapse in the Ukrainian will or capacity to fight, but there's no sign of that yet. The high profile equipment they are getting is a force multiplier, but the flow of ordinary ammunition, fuel and funds is just as important. So far the world seems to be focused on keeping that flowing which helps them maintain a better position in this grinding war...  both sides are certainly losing gear at a fast rate, the Russian losses are insane.

This is the exact consensus that my post was attempting to address. What makes you so sure outside of it being everyone's current ""opinion"" that this will happen. There are so many variables in the near future that could absolutely nullify or alter the current trajectory. That equipment will become a force multiplier if and when it's supplied in amounts that is functionally effective and we're yet to see that happen which is my point i guess. I really hope it happens, there is just no certainty YET that it will.

>Yes, Ukraine could still lose this war, but the fact that most people on Reddit board would really like to see them win isn't really going to have that much impact on the outcome, so there's little inherent value in being the devils advocate unless you are a Russian shill or have some interesting new take / info on the situation.

True, this is fairly reliant on being able to maintain that range difference whilst effectively striking opposition positions and with the current defence in depth strategy being employed by the UA in the Donbass this isn't always easily achievable.

As morbid as it sounds, Ukraine has plenty of Russian war crimes to keep them motivated to go on.

Regardless of what *is* the real behavior of the Russian Army, we know that it's:

1. Not good.
2. The reputation of the Russian Army in a moral sense, if it ever was good, has been completely ruined.

The Russian Army has basically solidified itself in the conscious of most everyone as a bunch of mongrels and barbarians at best, who see TV and think ""Mine mine mine,"" or as a bunch of murderous sadists with no redeeming qualities among any of them.

At best, [you get incidents like this:](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-fight-to-survive-russias-onslaught-in-eastern-ukraine)

>Since February, shelling has hit apartment buildings and at least one school. On April 8th, Russian cluster munitions hit a train station in Kramatorsk as thousands were reportedly waiting to be evacuated. At least fifty-seven people died. Honcharenko said he arrived at the platform seven minutes after the strike. The ground was covered with body parts: arms, legs, a child with his head blown off. “I’ve never seen anything like it in my life,” Honcharenko said, “and frankly, it would have been better if I never did.”

As a standard matter of course, along with all the cities they bulldozed.

And at worst, we have claims that they're raping children under the age of 8. And, whether it was a misattribution of the cause...there were photographs of dead kids in a pile who were under the age of 8 accompanied with the claim.

It is going to be very hard for Ukraine to lose motivation to want to kick Russia out of their country when this is how Russia behaves, let alone the actions of the regime's intentions for the region.

Russia has 700-800 artillery pieces in the Donbas in total, including MLRS.  Ukraine has a slightly smaller number with, overall, somewhat inferior range in the region.

~130 advanced Western artillery pieces and 4 HIMARS -- so far-- is enough to significantly upset this balance.  Effectively employed, they will feast upon and destroy a whole lot of Russian artillery with counter-battery fire, enabling the smaller, older Ukrainian pieces to be positioned to soften emplaced Russian troops.

The big question is manpower and air power: does Russia have people and maintained units to replace the losses?  Can Russia commit air power to neutralize the relatively small number of Western-provided artillery units?

If not overrun and not destroyed by air strikes, it's not unreasonable to expect 3:1 or better exchange ratio.",False,1654667975.0,t3_v7gbn3,t1_ibkth11,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

We don't know the answers to those questions but it would only take dedicating 10,000 of those that they mobilized that already had experience to start training others to produce a lot of new troops. So does that make for tens of thousands of new troops? Hundreds of thousands? Who knows for sure but just because they didn't have the capacity before the latest Russian invasion doesn't mean they haven't rapidly expanded it and all the donated equipment flooding in would certainly seem to help arm them.

No country in the west is suffering from hyper inflation right now, not even any EU countries and the only NATO country that is suffering from it is Turkey and it's mostly Erdogan's incompetence at managing an economy that is to blame for that. Hyper inflation is usually when all goods are going up 50% *every single month.* And no gas spiking in price is still not hyper inflation because not only is it just one thing we spend money on but it as also stabilized and is not increasing 50% every month. The west is suffering from inflation but it seems so much worse because we haven't had to deal with it much in the 2000's and inflation was already in motion before this war started as well.

And the gas price rise is because of sanctions on Russian fossil fuels, even if the west/EU weren't giving Ukraine money and arms the sanctions would still be there and that price rise would still happen.

So once again what do we propose we do instead of supporting them? Do you think that doing nothing and letting Russia invade whoever they want won't just lead to some other crisis that restricts trade? Do you think we should have just let Russia have Ukraine and not even sanction them? Don't you get that just encourages them to do it again leading to more instability in the future?

It seems for once we're finally learning from history and recognizing we should have done far more in 2008 when Russia occupied some of Georgia and we should have really freaked out when they did it again in 2014 to Ukraine. Instead we did very little and look what it got us, the largest was in Europe since world war 2. Every time we did nothing it just encouraged Russia to do worse the next time. Putin needs to be stopped this time or who knows how bad what he might do next will be and we know it will be worse because that's what already happened, every war he started has been bigger than the last.

Doing nothing isn't an option so unless you have actual suggestions on how to curb Russian aggression your opinion is rather pointless because it isn't grounded in reality, we have to do something, appeasement is not he answer and even just sanctions will still mean an increase to inflation.

The thing is, on both occasions the Finns had to make significant concessions to the Soviets after the wars. The survival of the Finnish state was solely at the grace of the Soviets, who didn't feel that complete conquest was necessary to achieve their own geopolitical goals. That the Finns humiliated the Soviet Army in the process makes it easier to swallow, but at the end, the Finns lost a lot of very productive territory, and a quarter of the Finnish population became refugees and had to relocate inside of Finland.

That made be hard for some people to grasp due to the memes made about the Winter War, but those are the facts- the Finns lost in the end.

In regards to the current conflict, I keep seeing people in these threads *insist* that Russia is losing the war... while Russia is squatting on 1/5 of Ukrainian territory and continues to advance into Ukraine. The territory occupied by Russia also includes several major cities and millions of Ukrainians, who are now experiencing a genocide. 

If this is Ukraine winning, then winning looks an awful lot like losing.

I agree. A partial defeat is better than a complete loss of your entire state.

It's still a defeat. The Soviets got a bunch of land over the course of their two wars, and after the Continuation War they basically had a veto on Finnish foreign policy.

The fact that many of those deported ended up dying was viewed as more of a feature than a bug, as it was usually done to populations that the Soviets viewed as rebellious, so partially exterminating them without being too overt about it was viewed as a fortunate outcome. How can any of that be reverted?

For the record, Germany officially abandoned all claims to what was once Prussia.
