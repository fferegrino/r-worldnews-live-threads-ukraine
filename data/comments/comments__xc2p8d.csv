Day 201 of my updates from Kharkiv.

After the power plant was hit at 8pm yesterday it didn’t just cut electricity, but also all water, because with no electricity pumps can’t work. Thankfully just after 6 hours after the blackout the power was already fixed, so at 2am we already had electricity here, but not in every district. It took a bit longer for water to start running; it was fixed at around 6-8am. 

It’s honestly pretty unbelievable that they managed to fix the electricity problems after one of the biggest thermal power plants was hit in just 6 hours, we thought it would take far more time than that, those repairmen are amazing. Though the electricity was weaker after it was turned on, stuff like electric kettle and oven took much more time to heat up.

Russians hated the fact that we managed to fix electricity and water problems so fast, so they hit our critical infrastructure again at 1pm, after that electricity, along with all water, was cut yet again. We don’t know what they hit that time, but it was fixed after about 4 hours, so we already had electricity running at 5pm, water took a bit longer and was fixed at 7pm. 

Russians in their telegram channels and their propagandists were **very** happy about our electricity being cut, it even made them forget about their shameful retreat from the entire Kharkiv oblast for a bit. Those bastards actually think that they can bomb our critical infrastructure and get away with it. Well, then they should be prepared for, at least, all of the border Russian cities to plunge into darkness as well, two can play this game, they won’t be getting away with this.

Also don’t be surprised when Russians start protesting, but not to stop this war, they will protest to “stop being soft and use nukes already” because this is exactly what *all Russians* in their telegram channels say after they’ve been defeated in Kharkiv. They still think that they “haven’t even started fighting for real yet” and that they can win at any time, but just don’t want to for some reason. Their delusions are unreal.

The fact of the matter is that russia is a spent force while Ukraine is an increasing force. If they continue to overextend themselves, they’ll likely lose Crimea too.

>KHARKIV, Ukraine — Stunned by a lightning advance by Ukrainian forces that cost it over 1,000 square miles of land and a key military hub, Russia on Sunday acknowledged that it had lost nearly all of the northern region of Kharkiv after a blitzkrieg thrust that cast doubt on a premise — widely held in Moscow and parts of the West — that Ukraine could never defeat Russia.
>
>Russia’s pell-mell retreat from a wide section of Ukrainian territory it seized in the early summer rattled Kremlin cheerleaders and amplified voices in the West demanding that more weapons be sent to Ukraine so that it could win.
>
>But the speed of Ukraine’s advances over the weekend in the northeast — an area used by Russia as a stronghold — has muted the gung-ho bluster of Kremlin cheerleaders. It has also undermined arguments in places like Germany that providing more and better arms to Ukraine would only lead to a long and bloody stalemate against a Russian military destined to win.
>
>Late Sunday, in a strike that Ukrainian officials condemned as a fit of pique over its losses, Moscow attacked infrastructure facilities in Kharkiv, leaving many civilians without power and water. President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was a “total blackout” in the regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk.
>
>“No military facilities,” he wrote on Twitter. “The goal is to deprive people of light and heat.”
>
>And the authorities in Moscow presented the rout in the northeast as a planned “regrouping.”

This is the perfect example of an excellent speech. To the point, straightforward, climax right at the end, with its own melody. A complete message, both personal and political, a clear demarcation, a rejection of any ingratiation. All this in some 100++ words, easy to understand, it goes to the heart and brain - and stays there.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 12 September 2022


- In the face of Ukrainian advances, Russia has likely ordered the withdrawal of its troops from the entirety of occupied Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. Isolated pockets of resistance remain in this sector, but since Wednesday, Ukraine has recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London.

- In the south, near Kherson, Russia is likely struggling to bring sufficient reserves forward across the Dnipro River to the front line. An improvised floating bridge Russia started over two weeks ago remains incomplete; Ukrainian long-range artillery is now probably hitting crossings of the Dnipro so frequently that Russia cannot carry out repairs to damaged road bridges.

- The rapid Ukrainian successes have significant implications for Russia's overall operational design. The majority of the force in Ukraine is highly likely being forced to prioritise emergency defensive actions. The already limited trust deployed troops have in Russia's senior military leadership is likely to deteriorate further.",False,1662962374.0,t3_xc2p8d,t3_xc2p8d,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

>4. The document will be distributed ONLY among instructors **affiliated with the leadership of “United Russia”** and cannot be transferred for familiarization to third parties, including those affiliated to work in the liberated territories.  
  
>  
>2. Organization of work and collection of humanitarian aid  
>  
>  
2. To work with the local population of the liberated territories of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, **only persons approved by the instructors of “United Russia” or other** authorized structures are allowed.   
  
>  
>4. Work with the population of the liberated territories   
  
1. The work of public organizations that are not associated with the United Russia WFP is **necessary in order to establish contact with persons who have no idea about the political system of the Russian Federation**, as well as persons who avoid working with political parties and organizations.   
  
2. **Communication and coordination with the bodies of “United Russia” are confidential for the population** of the liberated territories and are not disclosed when working with the population.  
  
3. To carry out the work, the least protected segments of the population should be selected as the target audience, including large families, retirees, and others (lists of persons falling under these categories can be clarified with the heads of local administrations, village elders).  
  
4. Humanitarian aid is provided **impersonally on behalf of all citizens of the Russian Federation.**

Pretty much this stated that every ""humanitarian worker"" from Russia is directly from ruling United Russia party and whole ""humanitarian aid"" is just a scam used to leverage United Russia position in attemped annexation. But move along to Frequently Asked Question or how to tell people and further steps to do if locals ask question eg  


10. 	Will I be able to travel to other regions of Ukraine or Europe?	  
Agitator said: It depends only on the authorities of Ukraine and European countries.	

Further step: It is worth mentioning that now Russian-speaking people are being persecuted all over the world.  


11. I don't want live in Russia 

Agitator: You are simply afraid. Russia is a country of great opportunities, it has a great history.

Further step: Notify the military police or other law enforcement agencies.  


24. They say that there is poverty in Russia.  
  
Agitator said: This is a lie, in Russia almost everyone can afford a private car.

Further step: Tell them that cars in the Russian Federation are cheaper than in Ukraine  


To be honest, looking how much attacks was done on collaborators and how little info is in russian media about how many locals support Russia, deploying agitators acting as ""humanitarian aid"" was a failure.

One thing that happened today was that Russia had a submarine launch some missiles at Ukraine. They cost millions - the missiles themselves, I mean - and knocked out power for only a few hours at best. This is desperate shit. They gave away a (temporary) submarine position just to do that. Knowing how low equipped and shoddy their entire military is, ESPECIALLY their Navy, they just confirmed to the rest of the world that that submarine isn't somewhere that's a threat to the rest of the West. 

Not only did they spend precious resources on a pointless offensive, they played their hand on the big global chess game of 'where are all the nuclear subs in the world', and a bunch of American and European admirals probably breathed a big sigh of relief knowing that one was taken off the board as possibly being anywhere in the world of Western influence, because it was doing stupid pointless shit in the Black Sea. 

To put things in perspective, here's what Wikipedia has to say about US submarines being used as attack platforms:

>The Tomahawk was first used in combat on 17 January 1991, on the opening night of Operation Desert Storm. On that day, for the first time since the surrender of Japan in 1945, an American submarine fired in combat, when 12 Tomahawks were launched by U.S. boats in the eastern Mediterranean.

44 years without betraying their positions by firing, and when they did, it was with Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of *1,500 miles*. Meanwhile, the Russian sub that fired this volley was filmed from the fucking beach in south Crimea. Edit - By tourists with fucking mobile phones, that is, not even by some spy satellite or some shit. That's *insane*.

Way to show your whole ass, Russia, once again. And don't think we don't have ways to know if that sub ever tries to leave the Black Sea ever again. You just self-quarantined an entire attack sub.",1662968139.0,1662967522.0,t3_xc2p8d,t3_xc2p8d,,0,62,0,62,0,0,

Ukraine’s ambassador has called for more artillery and ammunition from Australia after a counter-offensive in the nation’s east saw Kyiv retake a key town from Russian control.

Vasyl Myrochnychenko says artillery is needed to hold onto the reclaimed Kharkiv, as he praised the Australian government for the Bushmaster armoured personnel vehicles that helped “liberate” the region.

“You’ve seen them perform really well, liberate Ukraine, this is awesome and everyone is talking about Australia,” he told AAP.

The ambassador says the Australian government could supply six or 12 howitzers after Canberra provided six lightweight, towed howitzers in April.

“What is most important now are artillery guns and ammunition,” he said.

.

> Dear subscribers and guests of the channel! On Friday, September 9, Russian President Vladimir Putin held an operational meeting via videoconference with the permanent members of the Russian Security Council. During the closed part of the meeting, the situation at the front and the loss of part of the occupied territories in several regions of Ukraine were discussed in a narrow circle. Most of the meeting was held in raised tones and reproaches from the president against the military and security leadership. During a “constructive” discussion of the problems, Putin decided to return to the original plans for a “special operation”, which were approved even before the start of the conflict, namely, systematically destroying critical infrastructure facilities with missile strikes, with an emphasis on energy infrastructure facilities. Putin believes that in this way it is possible to sow chaos, break the positive attitude and support for military operations on the part of the civilian population of Ukraine, showing that the damage to the civilian population on the eve of winter can be catastrophic.
I must say that they tried to dissuade Putin. So, Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev expressed doubts about the effectiveness of this decision, pointing out that, firstly, the situation now is fundamentally different from the one that was at the time of the conflict: Ukraine now has a trained mobilized army, air defense and “excellent” Western weapons have appeared , the war has been going on for more than six months and Russia no longer has the number of troops and weapons that it had before the start of the war, and secondly, the United States can allow the Ukrainian leadership to strike with weapons provided by them on objects in Russia.
Representatives of the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff also expressed their doubts and concerns about this. During the meeting, Putin postponed the decision-making, and already on Saturday, September 10, in the evening, against the backdrop of a news agenda about failures at the front and the need to actually leave the territory of the Kharkiv region, the president ordered strikes against the critical infrastructure of Ukraine, and the targets were approved and partially chosen by Putin personally.
On Sunday afternoon, Putin was informed that on Friday and Saturday, during the retreat of Russian troops, up to 100 Ukrainian DRGs (sabotage and reconnaissance groups), including among refugees, could have penetrated into Russian territory.
Already on Sunday evening, after a missile attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine, Putin was informed through the Security Council that informal negotiations with representatives of the US leadership had been interrupted, at the initiative of the American side. Also, the president was informed that in the light of these events, it is PROBABLY to expect a strike on objects in the Crimea and the Crimean bridge is one of the targets.
On our own behalf, we add that residents and guests of Crimea probably have the opportunity to leave the peninsula, the same applies to residents of the Belgorod region.

The retreat from Kyiv was made possible by light Ukrainian forces operating behind enemy lines and wreaking havoc on Russian convoys. This was made possible by Russia's hasty advance. Now, by breaking through Russia's main defensive lines and operating in the operational depth, Ukrainian recon and special forces could coordinate with partisans to replicate conditions similar to the first Russian retreat, only this time to disorganize and disrupt Russian forces in preparation for a Ukrainian advance. 

This is purely speculation, but in my mind it explains why we see Russians fleeing in panic from towns like Svatove, which should ostensibly be far behind the front lines. Such an advance would be unlikely with tanks, which are slower and fuel inefficient, much less so with foot infantry. Rather, it's the .50 cal-firing, MANPAD-launching soldiers riding on rugged off-road trucks, easily avoiding Russian checkpoints and roaming freely in the countryside. These are troops light enough to remain fast, but heavily-armed enough to ravage Russian convoys and send unprepared Russian soldiers into a panic. This would also explain why the Ukrainians are suddenly so tight-lipped about opsec: to keep the Russians guessing as to where these ""phantom fighters"" will strike next.

Two days has passed since, so lets see how it holds up.

I read the On This Day page on Wikipedia every day. Today I was bored so I skipped ahead a few days and it mentioned the Sukhumi massacre in Georgia. Even beyond 2014, there was a period in the 1990s when we really should have acted. Sukhumi didn't need to happen. Republika Srpska should not exist. It should be as much of a pariah as Russian-controlled Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea. I really wish we had gotten things right then, instead of doing the equivalent today of refusing to arm Ukraine and forcing them to negotiate giving up occupied, ethnically-cleansed territory.

Is it known whether Russia has stationed any nukes in Crimea since 2014? 

Ukraine has stated that they won't settle for the pre-Feb 24 territories, but intend to take back the pre-2014 territories, which includes Crimea. And I'm starting to believe this is possible. If there are nukes there, and Russia doesn't remove them ahead of time, then that means that Ukraine could suddenly be a nuclear power overnight, which would be an insane development. 

I'm probably way off the mark here, but I posted three days ago about[ a very rare tracked flight of a Russian plane from Simferopol in Crimea](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/x8px77/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/inmw94v/) to Moscow. Pretty freaking bold move, considering [Ukraine struck that very airbase](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/08/16/7363483/) the month prior.

This, of course, has me wondering what it was they felt was worth moving by air in a place that is very much not secure - they reportedly withdrew their fighter jets from Crimea (and I'd love for some satellite footage coverage nerds to weigh in whether that's been visually confirmed). So what is of such importance that they'd use a big plane to move it, instead of moving by truck or rail across the bridge?

Again, I may be jumping the gun here, or way off-base, but is it possible they were evacuating nuclear weapons, perhaps being pessimistic about their ability to defend Crimea, given revent Ukraine successes?

Again, I'm probably seriously jumping the gun here, and not trying to be inflammatory...

Edit: as expected, this is getting downvoted simply due to the mention of nukes. I am not asking about Russian use of nukes, I am asking about the possibility of Ukraine obtaining some by capturing Russian held territory since 2014. This is NOT a 'concern troll' post in the slightest.

I'm as tired as anyone about the constant questions about 'when will Russia use tactical nukes' or whatever. This is not one of those. The possibility that Russia stationed nukes in Crimea is a serious question and a total possibility.

^By ^J. ^M. ^Richardson

The trumpets have been silenced    
The boom of the rifle salute    
But an echo on the wind    
The solemn band once gathered    
Have all gone home    
A few stragglers remain    
Tethered to tombstones    
Or names etched in marble    
As if their grim vigil    
Could somehow raise the dead    
    

Night has fallen    
And day has arisen    
And then another    
And another    
All without the laughter    
Of family and friends    
Comrades in arms gently ribbing    
Or recounting another tale    
Of what almost happened    
But didn't    
That is    
Until it did    
And here we stand    
    

And there they remain    
A painful reminder    
Of the cost of Democracy    
The last and largest line of defense    
Against tyranny and terror    
The first in    
The last out    
And those who survive    
Reduced to an afterthought back home    
All but forgotten    
The wounded and the lost    
    

On good days there is family    
Happy memories recounted    
Friends who have seen and understand    
And those that don't    
But love as best they can anyway    
There is no reason in the loss    
No comfort in ceremony    
No salve for the grief that remains    
Year after year    
And still they fight on    
    

Some fight for honor    
Some fight for glory    
But for most    
Simply because it is the right thing to do    
Protect and defend    
The honor of service    
The comfort of their fellows    
The security in knowing    
That they are part of something    
That never ends and never dies    
And that even in death    
Some part of them remains    
Forever a testimony    
To what it means    
To serve",False,1663036216.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io79a71,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

>A water tower is an elevated structure supporting a water tank constructed at a height sufficient to pressurize a distribution system for potable water, and to provide emergency storage for fire protection.[1] Water towers often operate in conjunction with underground or surface service reservoirs, which store treated water close to where it will be used.[2] Other types of water towers may only store raw (non-potable) water for fire protection or industrial purposes, and may not necessarily be connected to a public water supply.

>Water towers are able to supply water even during power outages, because they rely on hydrostatic pressure produced by elevation of water (due to gravity) to push the water into domestic and industrial water distribution systems

4. Creating a buffer zone if any of these is not met

In a lot of places this has been reported as a win for Ukraine, but if true, I rather think this an attempt from the military to pressure Putin into calling for a general mobilization. We know from several sources that the military has felt that they are being held back by not having access to their general reserves and instead were having to fight with a volunteer army with the result that they have been severely undermanned since the start of the conflict.

Essentially, this is them saying: ""We are out of people, so we are simply not sending any more. If you want us to send more men, call for a general mobilization"". 

Combined with the precarious position Putin is in, it seems feasible that Russia would call for a general mobilization, under the guise of ""NATO is fighting in Ukraine, it's not a fair fight anymore, so we now have to do this if we want to rid the world of Nazis"". There's a reason he has resisted this move so far however and by all accounts this type of move would be incredibly risky for him from a political point of view. On the other hand, being humiliated by the Ukrainians on a daily basis also seems to carry immense risk for him - so perhaps we can expect a general mobilization in the coming days or weeks..",1663028096.0,1663027747.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io6u89j,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

The other surprising thing was that the Russian marines patrolling the waterways kept ending up as floating bodies.  That stopped by end of May.  It was the local fisherman—they knew all the nooks.

This is the biggest kicker.  The US merely gave training and equipment. Only engaged as an advisor. The UA has effectively halted this operation objectives since day one, with just an Advisory support from NATO.  

This is Russia we're talking about. Russia, until they attacked, was seen as a near peer rival.  Russian/Soviet Weapons are quite effective.  Russia's elite units were Fubar'ed during their air assaults in the first few days. 

The Nations who should be most upset about the is PRC. They relied on Russia type equipment.  Outright copying the weapons (Roman style) in an attempt to make them their own.  PRC's Near peer rival status is based alot on what kind of weaponry they have.  the UA just shown the world that These types of weapon systems combined with just a bit of training arnt nearly the threat they were once seen as. 


Saidly the only thing PRC and RU can fall back on are their nukes. 

good news though:  China doesnt have very many and would likely use them against the US' Navy and not the mainland.   Russia? Dollars to donuts there is a culture of ""we'll never use them, we don't really need to spend the money to keep working""

* Russia chose to invade in winter, which blunted their ability to maneuver and forced them to contend with the weather as well as the battlefield.

After Griffin's remarks, Tucker Carlson — who hosted Macgregor on two successive nights — remarked, ""Unlike many of the so-called reporters you see on television, he is not acting secretly as a flack for Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon.

Outside of the general area of this week's push these are MOSTLY areas Russia abandoned. Often without even really fighting for them (i.e. they could have held out in Sumy and around Kharkiv city and elsewhere in the north and took damage for weeks or moths more, but decided those werent strategically important enough to do so.)  


Its fairly clear at this point that Russia REALLY prizes Crimea, and the various connections to Crimea (need the land bridge to Donetsk to be able to connect directly with Russia. Need Kherson to make sure the water supply isnt messed with). Crimea seems to have been the driving force behind this whole thing.  


Russia is spread thin. In the spring that meant giving up on the northern front (which was mostly a way to end the war early by decapitating the government that ended up not working because Russia's army is incompetent's and Ukraine's government and army competent and extremely ballsy). Now it means they dont have enough guys to do defense in depth in Kharkiv, so once their front line got beat they were done (and it doesnt make sense to keep fighting with limited troops for territory that isnt that meaningful in the ultimate goal of holding and securing Crimea and its connections).  


Maybe thats the case everywhere. Maybe Russia really is just a front line and thats its. But Kherson seems to indicate otherwise. Obviously they are largely cut off there, so they can only hold out so long. But it hasnt been easy going there for Ukraine.

… Bravely bold Z Soldier

Rode forth from the Kremlin.

He was not afraid to die,

Oh brave Z Soldier.

He was not at all afraid.

To be killed in nasty ways.

Brave, brave, brave, brave Z Soldier.

… He was not in the least bit scared

To be blown into a pulp.

Or to have his eyes gouged out,

And his elbows broken.

To have his kneecaps split

And his body burned away,

And his limbs all hacked and mangled

Brave Z Soldier.

… His head smashed in

And his heart cut out

And his liver removed

And his bowls unplugged

And his nostrils raped

And his bottom burnt off

And his penis...

Brave Z Soldier ran away.

Bravely ran away away.

When danger reared it's ugly head,

He bravely turned his tail and fled.

Yes, brave Z Soldier turned about

And gallantly he chickened out.

Swiftly taking to his feet,

He beat a very brave retreat.

To the U. S. A. Commander of the encircled town of Bastogne.

The fortune of war is changing. This time the U. S. A. forces in and near Bastogne have been encircled by strong German armored units. More German armored units have crossed the river Ourthe near Ortheuville, have taken Marche and reached St. Hubert by passing through Hompres-Sibret-Tillet. Libramont is in German hands.

There is only one possibility to save the encircled U. S. A. Troops from total annihilation: that is the honorable surrender of the encircled town. In order to think it over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note.

If this proposal should be rejected the German Artillery Corps and six heavy A. A. Battalions are ready to annihilate the U. S. A. Troops in and near Bastogne. The order for firing will be given immediately after this two hour’s term.

All the serious civilian losses caused by this Artillery fire would not correspond with the well known American humanity.

ca29f1f8255ab8c986a5dde2cf99b7de,xc2p8d,io76ixo,"For Captain Andriy Malakhov and his Wild Steppe special-forces unit, the mission was to distract Russian troops while their comrades retook Balakliya, a city the invaders had held since March. He explains how it worked.

Captain Andriy Malakhov and his men crept forward through the forests south of the city of Balakliya. They knew that, just ahead, was the enemy’s first line of defence in the Kharkiv region, a network of trenches and fortifications they had heard the Russians refer to as “Moskva,” or “Moscow,” in intercepted walkie-talkie chatter.

Capt. Malakhov and the 30 troops following him understood, too, that they were outnumbered by the 100 or so Russian soldiers guarding the line, who also had dug-in tanks and artillery. But at dawn on Sept. 7, he and his battalion – a special-operations unit known as Wild Steppe that reports directly to General Valery Zaluzhny, the commander of Ukraine’s Armed Forces – attacked anyway.

The objective was not to overwhelm the enemy. It was a diversion – and it worked.As  
 Russian troops defending Balakliya redeployed south to reinforce Moskva, the main Ukrainian assault, which had begun its advance a day earlier, punched through the thinned-out Russian lines north of the town.“They thought we were the   
main threat, but it was only our battalion,” Capt. Malakhov said in an interview with The Globe and Mail in a Kharkiv hospital, where he is recovering from injuries he sustained in the fighting.

With the Ukrainian military barring media from the newly liberated areas,   
Capt. Malakhov’s eyewitness account is one of the first to emerge of a counteroffensive that has seen Ukraine retake more than 3,000 square kilometres of territory, reshaping the six-month-old war here.

By the end of Sept. 7, Balakliya – a city of 20,000 that had been under Russian control since March – was back in Ukrainian hands. And the Wild Steppe battalion had crossed the strategically important Siverskiy Donets river, firing on Russian troops as they staged a chaotic retreat.

The fall of Balakliya precipitated a wider collapse of the Russian front line, allowing Ukrainian troops to capture the strategic railway hub of Kupyansk, as well as the city of Izyum, which had been the centre of Russian military operations in the region. By Monday, Ukrainian troops were in control of almost the entire Kharkiv region.

Russia, meanwhile, for a second straight day retaliated by striking at civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv and other cities. Much of Kharkiv was blacked out Monday – power had been briefly restored after a Sunday missile strike on the city’s electrical grid – and Mayor Ihor Terehov wrote on his Telegram channel that Russian forces had also targeted the water supply to Ukraine’s second-largest city, which had a prewar population of 1.4 million.

Malakhov credited the bait-and-switch tactics to Gen. Zaluzhny, whom he has known  
 for years. He said the top general seemed to have convinced President Volodymyr Zelensky that a counterattack had a better chance of succeeding in the forests and swamps of Kharkiv – where special-operations units can have an outsized impact – rather than on the open plains of Kherson, where Russia’s artillery advantage would be   
hard to overcome.

The Kharkiv counteroffensive, which appears to have caught Russian forces almost   
completely unprepared, was more than a month in the making.The Wild Steppe battalion had been fighting in the Kherson region until the start of August, when they were redeployed to Kharkiv on direct orders from Gen. Zaluzhny. 

On Aug. 6, they started laying the groundwork for what was to come with an attack on the village of Bairak, just south of Balakliya. They failed to take Bairak but left behind several undercover saboteurs who waited until the September offensive was under way to blow up a bridge in the village and destroy a key Russian supply line.After  
 the Bairak skirmish – in which, Capt. Malakhov said, both sides sustained significant casualties – the Ukrainians waited and built up their presence in the region while Russia continued to move forces south from Kharkiv to bolster the Kherson front.

Finally, last Wednesday morning, the real counterattack began. At first, the   
Russian troops – members of the 150th Rifle Division, as well as marines from the 1st Baltic Sea Fleet – put up a fierce defence of the Moskva line. Then, likely realizing they were being outflanked, they suddenly withdrew.

By the time the Wild Steppe fighters – all of them veterans of the eight-year war in the   
Donbas region, which preceded Russia’s full-blown invasion this year – reached Moskva, it was deserted. The Russians had withdrawn in an orderly fashion, taking their dead and injured with them. That wasn’t the case by the time the Ukrainians overtook the second trench line, which the Russians had nicknamed “Peter,” after St. Petersburg.

“When we started to properly advance, they started to leave their bodies behind,” Capt. Malakhov said, calling one of his men into his hospital   
room to show The Globe photos of dead Russian soldiers that he had taken  
 with his iPhone.

As the Russians realized the precariousness of their position, they started to flee in   
different directions. Some held together with their units, fighting as they withdrew southeast toward the adjacent Luhansk region. Others deserted their equipment, took off their uniforms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to evade capture, Capt. Malakhov said.

His iPhone has photos of armoured vehicles, ammunition and uniforms left behind by fleeing Russian forces, as well as a video of his men taking down the red Soviet-era banner of the 150th Rifle Division from the village of Nova Husarivka. They later raised the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag, a moment that brought joy to Capt. Malakhov and his men.

A few of the escaping Russians dove into the nearby Siverskiy Donets and   
tried to swim to safety. The Wild Steppe fighters crossed the river in inflatable boats and pursued them to a nearby Young Pioneers camp – a remnant from the days when both Ukraine and Russia were part of the Soviet Union – that the Russians were using a base.

A ferocious firefight ensued, in which Capt. Malakhov was struck three   
times by machine-gun fire. Two bullets tore through his left leg, another slammed into his hip.He fell, unable to carry on, but his unit pushed forward and is still part   
of the ongoing counteroffensive, which on Monday continued to liberate towns and villages in the Kharkiv region. Despite his injury, Capt. Malakhov, a 46-year-old father of two, said he takes pride in leading his men from the front.

“If you’re asking about motivation, \[Russian\] commanders never go to the front   
line. … If I’m leading the attack, my men will follow me,” he said, in evident discomfort a day after an operation to remove the bullet from his hip.

Lieutenant Taras Berezovets, a press officer for another Ukrainian special-operations   
unit that took part in the offensive, confirmed that the Wild Steppe fighters had liberated three villages – and that Capt. Malakhov, whose nom de guerre is “Tuman,” or “Fog,” had led the assault himself.“

He was leading the attacks at least twice,” Lt. Berezovets said. “He was the first to jump into the trenches – and he was wounded the next day after taking control over the Moskva fortified position. … Tuman will get a nomination for the Hero of Ukraine.”

The fact that a top commander had to wait five days for an operation – “I had to wait until they could find a table to operate on” – speaks to the number of Ukrainian troops wounded in the counteroffensive to liberate the Kharkiv region. But Capt. Malakhov said morale remains high, which is a key difference between his men and the Russians who fled their posts.

The assessment mission analyzes and assesses the overall security, political, military, humanitarian and human rights situation on the ground, and its implications for a possible operation. Based on the findings and recommendations of the assessment mission, the UN Secretary-General will issue a report to the Security Council.

The report will also include financial implications and statement of preliminary estimated costs.

The resolution sets out the operation’s mandate and size, and details the tasks it will be responsible for performing. The budget and resources are then subject to General Assembly approval

I think Ukraine is much more prepared than the Russians and the weather conditions have proven for centuries to be decisive in eastern europe (romans, napoleonic wars, 2º WW, etc). Ukraine won't be pushing forever, and when this counteroffensive stalls, it will be pretty much already in cold weather, so they can push and dig in for the winter.

They are an alternate source of gas to Europe with gas exports from both itself and those connected by the Trans-Caspian pipeline like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, the latter has the some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world, bar Russia. Losing them would be a big blow to Europe's goal of not being dependent on Russian gas. 

They are also the ones who will likely side with Europe due to their connections with Turkey and the gas sales. This also means Georgia will be inclined to side with Azerbaijan since they get revenues from those pipelines while also having good relations with Turkey.

Armenia on the other hand doesnt really offer much to Europe in resources.

For what it's worth, warheads themselves are relatively small in most cases, so you wouldn't need a big plane to move it. Though you potentially would if you were moving the system the warhead is mounted on as well.

It's possible there were some warheads in Crimea, but unless they've got an intention to potentially use one for defense, by now they'd likely have pulled them out. Don't forget, the Kerch bridge exists as well, and rail transit (particularly on military shipments) is certainly a viable way of moving some around.

As far as what would happen if Ukraine actually got their hands on some Russian warheads? I wouldn't say it's so definitely fixed that NATO and Co would be terribly interested in letting them keep the warheads, and Ukraine would probably actually be fine turning them over. Why? Because part of the point in being a NATO member is that the nukes of the member nations that have them are also there to defend all the member nations. Further, Ukraine is kicking Russia's ass without nukes and only the random assortment of castoff gear that NATO has been giving them. They haven't even gotten the ""good toys"" like proper modern tanks or aircraft yet. Russia is the only ""real"" entity they are likely to have to contend with for the foreseeable future.

Estimates that I've seen indicate that Russia's troops need about 4,500 tons of supplies each day, but with their various pontoon strategies, they are barely managing to get 1,000 tons in per day on a good day.

All Ukraine really has to do is just put enough pressure on positions in Kherson for the Russians to get them to waste ammunition and fuel by reacting to the pressure.

Functionally, while the Kharkiv counteroffensive needed to be door-kickers pounding through things, Kherson can be a bit more relaxed, doing the serious equivalent of lifting a helmet out on a branch to trick someone into shooting it.

As the Russians run out of supplies, they fall back on their own initiative, or when one of the pretend-serious advances seems too problematic and they break. It's not to say that Ukraine ISN'T taking this advance seriously, but the conditions are different then elsewhere.

The only real limits to Ukraine's ability to keep up the pressure are just their manpower limits, a piece of data virtually nobody but the Ukrainian leadership knows about with any specificity.

Its primary mission is to jam advanced air defenses during ground attack missions imitating electronic signatures of various aircraft while generating false targets within enemy sensors. The SAP-518 covers NATO surface-to-air and air-to-air threats in the G-J bands and is deployed in two underwing or wingtip pods. Installed on a single aircraft along with the SAP-14 jamming pod is considered similar to the United States ALQ-99 jamming system installed on the EA-6B Prowler and EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft. The electronic warfare system has been developed and manufactured by the Kaluzhsky Scientific Research Radio-Technical Institute (KNIRTI). Its existence was revealed at the MAKS 2009 airshow.

This is the single biggest mistake.

Even without large amounts of equipment and supplies, if you get to know some Ukrainians, they are a tenacious and proud people and rightly so.

With that basic experience and some fairly holistic military knowledge, I knew at the outset of the war that even at worst, Russia would be bled dry by an insurgency that makes Iraq/Afghan look like amateur-hour. Think Viet-Cong or any of the amazing resistance forces in Europe during WW2.

While I appreciate that Russia has some serious institutional military issues, it really annoys me how undervalued Ukrainian resistance, fight and general effectiveness has been overlooked.

Playing up Russian issues robs Ukraine of a true story that should be lauded and admired.

Make no mistake, military colleges (officer training) will be examining and studying what Ukraine has done in a range of different tactical and strategic situations for decades, if not centuries.

Consider this, they haven't taken years to turn the tide, but months. And while some of that is weapons and equipment, these are mostly 30 year old things and are meaningless without the people and C3 to effectively apply them.

This has been going on for a long time, but losing the war would amplify that feeling a hundred times or more over. Even if some kind of peace deal is implemented, I don't think peace would last for long.

History of peace deals teaches us I think two things, if the conquered is humiliated, if it is put into a hard economic situation, etc. there will be war again. There are only two pathways that do not lead to that, one is essentially complete obliteration of the enemy; this will not happen because the outside entities would not allow it; the other is heavy economic help, genuine attempts made to integrate the conquered to get back on its feet, etc.

This is something that I don't see discussed much within western  academic circles, if and when Ukraine drives out the Russian forces; what then? There is a justified anger in Ukraine that will not allow for any sort of peace deal that would be accommodating to Russia, the same is true of Russia. A peace treaty which nobody would like but both sides would accept would seem to be the only ""rational"" way out of this, but it will never happen. Look at the history of treaties between the two countries since 2014.

One counterpoint some people make is that all of this is entirely due to Putin, and if he is gone that amends can be made; but that's just not going to work. Maybe some ""liberal"" opposition in Kremlin comes to power, but in the long term any concessions that might be made would only strengthen Russia's perceived historic loss of importance on the world stage. It would lead to a similar situation that occurred in Germany after WW1.

What happens next, I would think, is the power struggle. While the siloviki may hold real power, they have to keep the illusion of democracy, and no one so far has the advantage that Putin had of being ""picked"" by Yeltsin and preparing the population for his ascent. So if they are smart about it, they would let Mishustin rubber stamp things while prepping the nation through propaganda for a longer term replacement, who will get in via the rigged votes but at least with some legitimacy in the eyes of the population, which is important.

Legitimate Military Objectives Under The Current Jus in Bello
by Yoram Dinstein


The Principle of Distinction and Military Objectives
A listing of objectives that are “military by nature:”

“(m) Power plants (electric, hydroelectric, etc.) serving the military;
(n) Arteries of transportation of strategic importance, principally mainline railroads and rail marshaling yards, major motorways (like the interstate highways in the US,56 the Autobahnen in Germany and the autostradas in Italy), navigable rivers and canals (including the tunnels and bridges of railways and trunk roads);”

“A bridge, as a rule, would qualify as a military objective (by nature, location, purpose or use).”

“Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”

“4. Industrial plants
It is exceedingly difficult to draw a dividing line between military and civilian industries. Sometimes, even the facts are hard to establish. Who is to say whether a textile factory is producing military uniforms or civilian clothing? In wartime, civilian consumption gives way as a matter of course to military priorities. Can one seriously asseverate that certain steel works ought not to be classified as military objectives only because their output has heretofore been channeled to the civilian market?”

“5. Oil, coal and other minerals
What is the status of oil fields and rigs, refineries, coal mines, and other mineral extraction plants, which are not ostensibly tied to military produc- tion? In the final analysis, despite their civilian bearings, all of them can be deemed to constitute the infrastructure of the military industry.”

“6. Electric grids
Can power plants in civilian metropolitan areas be set apart from military power plants? During the Gulf War, the Coalition air campaign in 1991 treated as a military target the integrated Iraqi national grid generating and distributing electricity (used both by the armed forces and civilians).98 Undeniably, an integrated power grid makes an effective contribution to modern military action:99 any shortfall in military requirements can be compensated at the expense of civilian needs. Indeed, the Coalition attacks against Iraqi power generating plants and transformer stations had a great impact on the Iraqi air defense structure (supported by computers), unconventional weapons research and development facilities, and telecommunications systems.100 The large- scale attacks also had unintended—albeit inevitable—non-military conse- quences, such as the disruption of water supply (due to loss of electric pumps) and the inability to segregate the electricity that powers a hospital from “other” electricity in the same lines.101 But these unfortunate results did not detract from the standing of the Iraqi electric grid system as a military objective.”

“9. Civilian television and radio stations
In wartime, control of civilian broadcasting stations can at any time be assumed by the military apparatus, which may wish to use it in communications (e.g., summoning reservists to service), in pursuit of psychological warfare, and for other purposes.”",False,1663009740.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io495ms,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Even more amazing is how \*ucker Carllson and the US rabid right licks this up like dog vomit; I realize that most of my generation reflexively dislike Putin's authoritarianism even if they want it replicated here in abortion laws, etc.  I can't figure out whether Carllson is funded by Putin, just a fellow-traveller authoritarian, or just being an asshole as an identification project.  I know Trump is addicted both to russian oligarch money and the dream of being a Putin authoritarian, but I just can't understand the attraction of the rightwing assholes to these assholes.

I grew up in an Evangelical household, but my father the minister was just a theologian whose hero was Paul preaching to the Gentiles (his first church was a black church in southern Oklkahoma in the mid 1940s when he was 16.

I don't understand ""American Conservatism's"" schoolgirl crush on Putin and authoritarianism.  I know it entangles with American corporate fascism, but it's weird as hell, along with its fixation on military weapons for all and control of vaginas.

Their lines are shortened and the evacuated soldiers can be used to reinforce their lines.  Every Russian BTG is understrength so they can just spread the survivors in to replenish them vs refitting and reorganizing the destroyed units.  Ukraine's inevitable victory in Kherson will again solve a lot of Russian problems if they can withdraw those units across the river and now have more men to man a much much shorter line.  And again, if Ukraine can take advantage and capture North Luhansk to Severodonetsk, that again shortens the line and the distance of supply from Rostov.

I hope Ukraine can go all the away, but winning territory does not make you safe.  There seems to be an argument that if Russia gets away with taking land, Ukraine will never be safe.

South Koreans and others like the Taiwanese are free today while under threat from large authoritarians because they got their shit together and built their countries up so they are wealthy and have sophisticated militaries with strong alliances.  Ukraine could win back everything back, but if it even goes back to it's shitty corrupt ways, they will never be safe.

Almost a fifth of the world's population live in China, and are being counted towards the ""more than half"" that you mention.  But those people have no choice over their representatives, so those representatives' lack of condemnation doesn't really tell us much about their peoples' views.

About the same amount again live in India, and whilst they are a democracy with some sway over their representatives the decision to condemn or not ultimately rests with just a few people with whom the electorate may or may not agree (or indeed, may not care).

I rather think that if anything, *now* would be the best time to announce a mobilization. It's going to take months to get people up and running anyway and fighting will likely die down in the winter, favouring the defending side (now Russia). Conceivably, by mobilizing now or in the coming weeks, Russia could have new recruits coming in by the spring when fighting in force would resume.

Don't get me wrong, that doesn't solve their equipment issue and likely would be no more than a delaying tactic. But it's starting to seem that Putin has no other options at this stage. At the very least, mobilizing would get the military of his back. The question here is: what is more dangerous to his position, losing the war in Ukraine or calling for a general mobilization.

Based on the survivability of Ukrainian air frames in close range to Russia's state of the art AA defenses like the S-400, it's pretty obvious at this point that America's air fleets would have actually outperformed their publicly available predictive capabilities against Russia's air force and ground AA batteries. Within a day, the US stealth bombers and cruise missiles would very likely wipe out all AA ground batteries and airbases for 4 to 500 kilometers around the battle theater, without taking any meaningful losses. The following week would be a relentless series of thousands of air sorties and missile strikes (not dozens like Ukraine is currently capable of) that destroy and lockdown any surviving ground forces. Russia's only realistic defense against these weapons would be a nuclear retaliation.",1663008037.0,1663007625.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io5irtk,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

 >The Chengdu J-20 (Chinese: 歼-20; pinyin: Jiān-Èrlíng), also known as Mighty Dragon (Chinese: 威龙; pinyin: Wēilóng), is a twinjet all-weather stealth fighter aircraft developed by China's Chengdu Aerospace Corporation for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). The J-20 is designed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability; it descends from the J-XX program of the 1990s. The aircraft made its maiden flight on 11 January 2011, and was officially revealed at the 2016 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. The aircraft entered service in March 2017, and began its combat training phase in September 2017.

An aircraft can *have been grounded* due to bad weather or while it's repaired.  But the peppercorns *have been ground* and are now small enough to fit through the shaker.  

So *grounded* only works for the verb *to ground*, not for the verb *to grind*.  *Grind down* is a phrasal verb and *grind* conjugates normally within that phrase.  

*Grounded* is derived via a noun, *the ground*, rather than from a verb form.  It uses zero-formation and regular forms.  Its principle parts would be *ground - grounded - grounded*.  

*Grind* is a strong verb originally showing the same ablaut pattern as *drink*.  You have *drink - drank - drunk*, but the past form *grand* didn't survive into Modern English, so you have *grind - ground - ground*.  

*Grinded* is a rare non-standard variant.  

Edit:  My snickering friend has reminded me that *grinded* can be correct for some special instances of *grind*, such as humping someone through clothes.

I'd also reiterate, not that anyone's listening, that it's not the case that 'far-anything supports Russia'.  There are more kinds of communists than there are capitalists, and look how hard it is for them to agree on anything.  

Among Russian apologists on the left, it's really two sorts:  traditional third-way groups in Europe who were Soviet-backed and whose funding continues to come from Russia even now that Russian ideology is completely at odds with socialist ideology, and some grassroots orgs in English-speaking countries whose work is activist rather than politic, youth-oriented, and whose entry point into socialism is anti-imperialist.  They just can't bring themselves to see a country like the US as on the right side of history in any particular conflict and they are more aware of its moral failings than of how removed the Soviet Union was from the kind of communism they subscribe to and how removed Russia is from the Soviet Union, for that matter, and engage in the delusion that there's continuity there.  

But the first MPs in Russia to speak out against the war were from its (barely tolerated) Communist party.  Trotskyist groups favor Ukraine.  Democratic socialists favor Ukraine.  It's complicated.

> I understand Russia are having resupply issues there with the bridge blown, but without the threat of encirclement they're not going to withdraw from the city because it's very easy to defend a major city.

Russia's leadership certainly has no intention of withdrawing, and the fact that they have Chechen's guarding what remains of the bridges to ensure nobody crosses back without permission, combined with the supply issues and Ukraine's near total air superiority in the region, it's not too surprising that you have units surrendering or attempting to flee.

> Realistically, if there are 20k Russian troops in Kherson, Ukraine would need to assemble a force probably at least 3-4 times that to assault the city itself, if they can't encircle it to force the Russians out. I just don't think that would be worth it to do, when those troops could be used against less effective defenses elsewhere. Fight everywhere except major cities and Russia will have to pull back.

Nominally, yes, you need at least a 3:1 ratio to succeed on an attack, and I think I recall hearing cities tend to be more like 5:1 and amphibious landings are more insane like 8:1. However, that assumes the defenders are fully supplied and capable of a proper defense. Again, the situation Ukraine has is one in which they can ensure Russian troops operate at a continuous deficit of troops. In some ways, it can literally be as easy as just making a big show of pivoting most of their tanks from one side of a town to another. Ukraine has no problems supplying it's vehicles with fuel, but every gallon of fuel that Russia burns responding to such a pivot is only being replaced by a quarter gallon from resupply.

Furthermore, Ukraine is making decent inroads towards the Dnipro. Just a few more towns in the right space, and they'll be able to bring up tube artillery (instead of relying on just HIMARS) in order to keep up a continuous bombardment of the spots being used as ferry locations. Not to mention that as they get closer, the reach of their hand-held recon drones puts the river in their sights, which would allow even better interdiction abilities. Worse for Russia, they are putting supplies on the south bank faster than they can be moved across, which is offering tantalizing targets for HIMARS to hit.

I would not be terribly surprised if in the next 1-2 weeks, the rate of Russian supplies crossing the Dnipro functionally dropped to zero. Ukraine will likely never totally cut it off, but a few tons of supplies here and there won't meaningfully help the ~20,000 troops stuck in Kherson.",False,1663031670.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io4rmrm,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

An excerpt:

> Ozyorsk – formerly known as Chelyabinsk-65 (Челябинск-65) and Chelyabinsk-40 (Челябинск-40), nuclear material processing and recycling plant.[13][14]

> Snezhinsk – formerly known as Chelyabinsk-70 (Челябинск-70), site of one of the two major Russian Federal Nuclear Centers.[13]

> Tryokhgorny – formerly known as Zlatoust-36 (Златоуст-36), site of development of parts and machinery for atomic stations and weaponry.[13]

And others that I won't bother to dig out, it seems like all the major facilities for research and production where within Russia itself during soviet times.

The only facility having a large role in producing nuclear weapons production in Ukraine [seems to have been one that produced yellow cake uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_city#Ukraine) however that still needs further processing to be used in nuclear weapons. Producing that does not mean they made nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

I have never heard that the nuclear weapons from end to end themselves were manufactured in Ukraine and in fact given the huge disparity in the location of nuclear facilities in the soviet union unless you have a source saying otherwise I do not believe the weapons were manufactured in Ukraine.

What's more [arms control experts](https://twitter.com/ArmsControlWonk/status/1490149702112841728) and institutions like the [International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons](https://www.icanw.org/did_ukraine_give_up_nuclear_weapons#:~:text=Ukraine%20never%20had%20an%20independent,nuclear%20weapon%20state%20in%201994.) point out how the weapons were in the command and control of forces loyal to the Russian army and Ukraine never really had possession of them. Yes some atomic weapons research took place in Ukraine but as [this Wilson Center article says](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/ukraine-and-soviet-nuclear-history) ""Ukraine had a leading position in Soviet nuclear physics in the 1920s and 1930s. But because of the war, the nuclear centers of the USSR moved to Russia.""

If you have sources that contradict that I'd be happy to look at them but it doesn't seem like Ukraine ever had the ability to use the ones located on their territory and they certainly did not produce nuclear weapons in the country. The primary facilities and expertise to do that was located in Russia, that would have made any tampering with them extremely dangerous.

It's just not. War crimes are a defined list of actions that you *cannot do* while conducting a military action. The vast bulk of Russian troops will not have violated those laws.

If you believe in any form of western justice system, you cannot condone collective punishments, punishing individuals for crimes other people have committed. That's not how we do things, and that's an important principle to uphold - especially in the face of outrageous tyranny and oppression.

Those who kill innocents are absolutely guilty and should be punished, but that's not every single Russian soldier. Those responsible for ordering deaths of civilians are absolutely guilty and should be punished, but that's not every single Russian soldier. 

Those war crime trials in Vietnam didn't hold the entire US military to account, did they? No, they targeted *individual* soldiers that broke the rules of war. I support the same system of justice being applied in this conflict.

If we applied your same logic, every single US veteran should have been held to account for the Vietnam war, an illegal war full of atrocities, which is just unreasonable.

Hold individuals to account, not collectives. You can't teach an army not to invade, that's what they're designed and trained to do.",False,1662988096.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io47d8t,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

So waiting a month or so could give them half a division of troops with which to engage in another push.

Also, and this part I'm a bit weak on because my Ukrainian geography is a bit on the lacking side, when the fall Rasputitsa kicks in and turns most of the East/Northeast into mud, I believe the southern front is not nearly so affected.

What that means is once things start getting muddy and wet on the Eastern fronts, Ukraine will be able to afford shifting soldiers south because almost any attacks that Russia might want to launch would be forced to stick to the roads (unless they want to be humiliated by the Ukrainian Tractor Division again) and thus easier to stop and contain.

Assuming what I just said is accurate (and it could very well not be) then it's possible that what happens is this. Ukraine begins (sooner or later) settling in for an operational pause in the Kharkiv/Luhansk regions to prep for the fall rains, regardless, they open the third front with the goal of slamming down to the shoreline and recover Mariupol. Meanwhile the Kherson situation continues degrading the Russians ability to do anything there. Once the mud is thoroughly debilitating, Ukraine can afford to pivot a good portion of its manpower down south to sweep along the shoreline till they reach the throat of the Crimean peninsula at Perekop. I think Russia would be monumentally stupid to leave the bridge along the E105 standing and they'd likely drop the two bridges at the Henichesk Strait further east. Though how problematic that actually would be is up for debate. On one hand, it seems likely Ukraine would be able to rebuild those bridges mostly without a care (I'd bet one of those new NASAMS units would end up over there to help cover it). On the other hand, if Russia didn't turn the Arabat Spit into the longest and narrowest minefield on the planet, someone over there is even more incompetent than we thought.

Of course, now I'm imagining the really hilarious news that Ukraine managed to slam down the Arabat Spit and cut the E97 (or more importantly, the rail line which they'd cut before hitting the highway) and REALLY put Crimea out of supply.

How realistic do you think it is that Russia retreats from multiple oblasts any time soon?

It is an assertion that i've seen shared far too much in the past 6 months on these threads, and as such deserves to be scrutinized, regardless if the assertion was made in jest or not - how can anyone know if a person is actually being serious or just memeing on the internet anyway?

Also about the soviets and the Finns, yes they got some territory, but it was a humiliation for the Soviets, their losses, and what they got out of it, it was simply not worth it, it was even more humiliated to Stalin when shortly after that, Hitler would go on to conquering 6 countries which included one of the World's major powers at the time, in a lighting campaign while suffering  insignificant losses.

They don't win this. There hasn't been a victory scenario for Russia in Ukraine ever since their advance towards Kyiv stalled and was forced to retreat. Ever since that point Russia could only hope for a ""honorable peace"", or in other words, a compromise with Ukraine.  However just because they can't win, doesn't mean that they can't stop Ukraine from retaking its territory in the short term, they absolutely can. Their forces can be reconstituted, rearmed, they can call for general mobilization and alleviate - but not completely solve their manpower issues -, and even an unmotivated force is capable of defensive operations, if properly supported.

My point is that, though I firmly believe that Ukraine will retake it's territory, i have no doubt that Russia can make that process as difficult and painful for Ukraine as possible, if they are given the room to actually do it.

You claimed that the U.S. was like Russia and when I brought up clear examples of free speech in the U.S. you ignored it because that doesn't fit your narrative. I told you why invading Canada would be completely illogical and you ignored it again because it doesn't fit your narrative. I told you that the majority of voters didnt vote for Trump and now because of the investigations his base is shrinking ( the investigations are yet another clear example of why the U.S. is not a fascist state). Now you've moved the goal posts saying the U.S. *could become* a fascist state which is so soft an argument. I could say that about almost any country.  Now you're saying the U.S. as a monolith is involved in a conspiracy to destabilize Canada because of what? A few million in donations? Do you realize how little money that is?

What leads you to assume that the execution phase of UAF's current counter-offensive ended with the capture of Kharkiv, and instead is not part of a larger multi-staged operation? The prep work, softening of positions and shelling of ammunition dups took place all summer long and spanned throughout the entire Donbass. We could be seeing a much longer active phase with full foot on the gas towards Mariupol in order to sever the landbridge, which was the touted ""aim"" of this whole operation in the Donbass. It's going to take years for UAF to COMPLETELY secure every Ukrainian territory, but that isn't what we are discussing here. We are talking about capture and control. If the Kremlin is truly no longer committing any new forces or resources to the offensive, then this is a sign of capitulation, as we know Russia needs far more than it currently has to sustain this frontline. So to quote you again:

> Putin get ousted or that Putin will give up Crimea etc. without a fight.

Precisely what I'm implying. If the current counter-offensive culminates in a re-capture of Kharkiv, Kherson, and a wedge straight through Mariupol, the snowballing domestic pressure that will undoubtedly result from it may force Putin to order a full retreat and withdrawal of all forces.

They don't have a fixed, distinctive sign recognisable at distance.
They don't carry arms openly.
Many of them don't conduct their operations in accordance with the laws of war.

This is a classic misconception about the soviets during WW2, the reality was a lot different, they adapted throughout the course of the war, and were able to successfully employ their own version of maneuver warfare.

That's quite a statement to make given you're not just suggesting I'm a fool but also that Arestovych who has said the exact same thing is, like you know better than him when he has even better information than we do.

Anything can happen, that's obvious. This is about if it will happen. We say it won't. You say it might but you still haven't answered the question about if they did manage to do this somehow, magically, which they won't, how that would get them out of the mess they're in given the other issues of men and equipment.

I'm not going to argue that Russia can ""win"". There was not a single comment i made in response to you, or anybody that i insinuated that Russia can ""win"". Quite the opposite I made it clear that i don't see how Russia can ""win"".   


What i said was that Russia can absolutely make it difficult and painful for Ukraine to retake its territory. And this should be fairly obvious. If the Ukrainian military were to throw caution to the wind, and believe that they are simply superior to the Russians who ""lack brainpower"" to adapt and challenge them, they may take risks that could cost them dearly it. They could for example, underestimate the Russians to the point where they make the same mistakes the Russians made at the very first days of the invasion, which was to outrun their own logistics, allowing their logistics to be vulnerable to harassment from both enemy ground and air units, this could lead to units at the front being isolated and cut off from supplies, which could result in their ultimate destruction.   


I'm not arguing that Russia can turn this defeat into a victory, the fate of their campaign against Ukraine was sealed the moment that their offensive against Kyiv failed. And one could very well argue that their political ambitions for Ukraine were destined to fail anyway but that's besides the point.  


What i'm saying is that the Ukrainian military should not underestimate the Russian military capabilities, because that was the mistake the Russians made, and look how they are paying for it right now. And look the Ukrainians also make similar mistakes (in a smaller scope at least), we saw this just a day or so ago with the failed attack in Pisky, they underestimated the local Russian units, and paid dearly for it.",False,1663005416.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io5cvxf,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

If Ukraine retakes its territory Putin will be gone. Russia doesn't accept leaders who lose wars, especially at this level of cost. It never has. Even Tsars got ousted for losses like this.

>Arestovych is effectively a propagandist, what he says has little value in terms of objectivity. 

I can recognise his role as a propagandist but that doesn't mean he's always wrong or lying. The point remains they have systemic problems that you're ignoring and thinking they could fix.

The wars in Chechnya are another example. They didn't improve how they did things, they just sent more troops. Brute force almost brainless effort, same as Ukraine.

They haven't fixed it in 20 years, they're not going to fix it before Putin gets ousted. Maybe after that they will but the threat to Ukraine will be long gone, and their military will by virtue of economic and sanction reasons, as well as capability relative to a rearmed and NATO supplied Ukraine, be weaker.

>What i'm saying is that the Ukrainian military should not underestimate the Russian military capabilities

This is based on an assumption that you know better than them.

I'm not saying that Arestovych is always wrong. The best propaganda out there will always be the ones that has a bit of truth to it. However because of his role as propagandist is so clear, i think it is unwise to base your opinions on what he's saying. But if you wanna do that of course, be my guest. 

I'd actually disagree with your assessment that the Russian army didn't change after Chechnya, i think they did. We saw signs of that reform back in 2014, where the Russian soldiers looked far more professional and disciplined than what was witnessed during the 1st and 2nd Chechnya war. We also saw a little bit of that ""professionalism"" in the early days of the invasion back in February. The Russians were able to conduct maneuver warfare, they broke through the Ukrainian lines, they attempted to take cities, but when those attempts failed they left blocking units to pin the Ukrainian forces in the cities while allowing maneuver elements to bypass those cities and keep going for their overall objective, which in the North was Kyiv, and the south was to create a land bridge between the occupied territory of Donetsk and Occupied Crimea. Those operations did achieve some successes, and it was partly down to the application of maneuver warfare.   


The problem of course is that though the Russians were able to do that fairly well when facing light resistance, once that resistance became more fierce, and Ukrainians started to harass their logistics, that ""professionalism"" broke down, and so did the discipline. So clearly the reforms that Russia's military undertook in the past decade or so had some impact, but didn't completely solve the Russia's military problems. I think Russia's leadership understood that, i think they realized that their army still lacked the training necessary to conduct proper maneuver warfare, so they defaulted to the other strategy of overwhelming enemy resistance with sheer firepower, and that's when we started to see the Russians using mass artillery to level entire towns and cities, like in Chechnya. 

I actually think that the advance of Ukrainian units especially after Russia's forces routed, shows that no, they are not underestimating the Russia's military power. For example, we don't see Ukrainians making a mad dash across the Oskill reservoir yet, quite the contrary we see that they seem to have stopped most of their advances to the west of the reservoir. I'm sure there are Ukrainian units operating in the east of that reservoir, but for the most part it looks like the Ukrainian military, understood that they need to secure their flanks before continuing their advance towards Luhansk. So actually i feel like i'm pretty much defending what the Ukrainians are doing now, which is to be prudent with their achievements, and secure it, before continuing with their offensive.",False,1663008866.0,t3_xc2p8d,t1_io5i74a,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
