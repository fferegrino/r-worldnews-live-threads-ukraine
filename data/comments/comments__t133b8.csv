The EU is preparing to freeze the assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov under the sanctions package being pushed through on Friday, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Foreign ministers are planning to approve the sanctions package this afternoon, along with a number of measures against Russian banks and industry, the people said.

Putin and Lavrov will not, however, be subject to a ban on travelling under the measures, underlining the EU’s willingness to keep symbolic diplomatic possibilities open.

According to Council President Charles Michel, the EU is about to impose further sanctions on Russia. The Ukrainian President had previously criticized the previous punitive measures as inadequate.

So far it is unclear which sanctions the EU could decide today. The ""Financial Times"" reports, citing insiders, that the EU is preparing to freeze the assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov sanctions package. Accordingly, the EU foreign ministers should approve the sanctions package in the afternoon, which should also include a series of measures against Russian banks and industry.

However, Putin and Lavrov will not be subject to a travel ban as part of the measures, underscoring the EU's willingness to keep symbolic diplomatic options open, the Financial Times report said.

""Respect Ukraine's borders, dependence, and sovereignty""
""Pledge to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations”.

In 2014, the Crimea issue was a violation of the Memorandum, but Putin argued the agreement was no longer valid because it was made with Ukraine's previous government.

But the Memorandum also states:

""Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments""

Putin did as he wished. And failed to consult with the parties in question.

So here we are. He violates agreements, does as he wants, and a nation that put their trust in the UK and US is essentially on their own, even though we promised to protect their security in exchange for them dismantling their nuckear arsenal.

Sure will send a message to other nationas that are asked to denuclearize in exchange for ""security""

Eastern line:

There's likely some sort of line along the Kharkiv Dnipro road meeting with the Dnieper, where one can expect a line along the Dnieper through to Kherson. With Melitopol occupied, the road south of Zaporizhzhia may be hard to defend, forcing Ukrainian troops to defend from the western bank. 

Forces from DPR, LPR are securing territory east of this line with mixed resistance. Sumy, west of Kharkiv has reportedly been surrounded according to local leadership, hampering the ability to form a strong northern defence to Kyiv 

Southern Line:

Reports have been circulating of attacks on port of Odessa but no news recently. Odessa holding keeps forces from being able to use the Odessa Kyiv road, and the many intersections leading to Lviv. If Russia's goals of causing civilian panic are to be believed, an easy way to do this would be to cause carnage on these roads as they are the gateway to Poland. 

The road also helps to form a defence against attacks on refugees from Kyiv, and will play a large part in preventing the absolute encirclement and potential siege at Kyiv.

No reports of violence along the Transnistrian border though explosions have been heard.

Western Line:

Whilst missile attacks have been reported in the west of Ukraine, nothing major is currently happening hear other than refugee columns which are growing longer. Less is being heard about the Slovakian or Romanian borders than Poland, which is experiencing a massive surge in refugees since the Kyiv attacks have intensified.

Russian troops are building up at Brest on the border with Poland. This is likely for attacks leading to Lviv and Ukrainian refugees. There is also the likelihood of Lviv being used for governmental figures if an evacuation is decided upon. This could very well be the seat of a puppet Ukrainian government if the DPR and LPR are given territory east of the Dnieper, but it's way too early to guess if that's even a thing Russia is thinking about in the event of Ukrainian defeat.

Northern Line:

There have been no attacks on the eastern side of the Northern Line. The Brest Kovel road hasn't seen attacks, Kovel to Korosten/Zhytomyr seems to be fine at the moment. Chernobyl has fallen, with workers detained and radioactive areas seeing agitation during the fighting. This helps to start an encirclement of Kyiv along with Cherniv, north east and north west of Kyiv respectively. Cherniv is currently holding which helps to secure Kyiv against attacks.

Regardless, attacks against Kyiv are heating up. Paratroopers are being used in force, and holding airfields to prevent troop planes from landing is becoming a key objective for Ukraine. 

Cherniv holding allows for access to the lower road leading from Kyiv to Kharkiv and the northern parts of the eastern line. I'm assuming the higher road leading eventually to Zheleznogorsk will have security issues at the border eventually joining with the incursion at Sumy. It may be cut to help defend the intersection as to protect Cherniv.",False,1645797871.0,t3_t133b8,t3_t133b8,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

The fleet of airplanes owned by their airlines? Boeing and Airbus. Off limits, can't get parts to maintain them. Technology from the US? Nope. Chips from Taiwan? Nope. And many, many more products made in the US, UK and EU that Russia is now incapable of importing from them.

They can try to find sanctuary in China, but it's questionable to which extent China would want to help Russia go around the sanctions, considering China's economy is HEAVILY reliant on global trade with the very nations that are sanctioning Russia.

BBC;

Russia is ready to send diplomats to Minsk for talks with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

According to the Interfax news agency, Peskkov said Vladimir Putin was ready to send officials from the Kremlin, defence and foreign affairs ministries for talks in the Belarusian capital to discuss “the neutral status of Ukraine”, adding that Ukraine’s “demilitarisation and denazification” were an essential part of this neutral status.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier in the day urged Russia to start negotiations, although it is unclear under which terms he would be ready to talk.

Putin’s entirely unfounded claim that Ukraine is under Nazi rule is a key part of the Kremlin’s justification for war.

As Russia has just sent a massive invading army into Ukraine, the latest announcement is been treated with scepticism by Moscow reporters.

The Kremlin statement came not long after foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia was only prepared to talk once Ukrainians “put down their arms”, suggesting, perhaps, some confusion over the Russian government’s intentions",False,1645798364.0,t3_t133b8,t3_t133b8,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

I just wanted to say that we as Italians do not condone how this is being handled, I feel profound shame once again for my country and for the priority it seems to hold on to when people at our door are dying and living this traumatic event. I am personally a very anxious person, so this couple of weeks have been very hard psychologically because all my head keeps thinking is that we are all going to die in a nuclear war. 

I know that in this moment we do not really have to fear this outcome but I have read some people saying that who feels anxious, the people who are having panick attacks ecc. who are not from Ukraine are acting like they are the center of the world; I'm here to say NO. 
You have to be a big fucker to think like this. 
We are all suffering seeing what is happening in Ukraine, I can't even imagine the horror they are living inside that situation and I feel like I can't do anything + my government is so detached from reality that it prefers to keep selling Gucci bags to Russians rather than sacrifice this part of the business for people who keep being killed by the minute. 
My mental illness, my ocd, my anxiety going crazy in this situation have nothing to do with me or us wanting to be at the center of attention. It's about the world, and seeing people who chose to think that people in fear from other countries are just attention grabbers for me is disgusting. Everyone is scared, for themselves and for their families, and yet we won't back down from doing what we can do for Ukraine, for Ukrainians, for everyone who needs support in this dark time. Maybe no one will read this comment but I really needed to say this out loud. Keep linking charities we can donate to, If there are some addresses we can send clothes or food to for the refugees, share what we citizen of Europe and of the world can do to help people in need.

**View from Moscow is here (I'm partially russian, partially ukrainian, living here with part of my family in Ukraine)**

Some random thoughts that doesn't understand the majority of the population of Western, civilized democracies. And what is really happening right now in RF under Putin's terrible, repressive terror.

1. Countries impose sanctions, believing that this will shake the Russian economy. This will shake, but it is important to understand that despite all these ""lists of oligarchs"", the government will force the ordinary population (most of whom live very poorly) to take most of the damage. Right now, the Russian oligarchs are speculating millions of dollars on the Moscow stock exchange: the dollar is fluctuating as much as 20 rubles an hour (or 15-20% in stocks) and yes, they are simply profiting from these fluctuations, just like the fluctuations of state banks or resource companies.

Foreign authorities are well known of these.Half of European politicians are fed from the hands of the Russian oligarchy. And these bloody scum understand that nothing will happen to them for what they are doing - precisely for the reason that they support the economy of foreign countries with money that they launder in the blood of the same Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians.West will arrest some bills to add to their own economies, tell something like ""HOLY SHIT, THAT'S WRONG"" and this is all. As Mister Z told on yesterday - no one really helped. No one really needs more problems. Help is only useful when you can sell some weapons or arrest some free bloody money. Not when you need to fight by yourselve without reasonable benefits.

Almost all are forgetting one very important thing, which for some reason is not discussed here at all. The war did not start yesterday or a week ago, not even a month ago. It has been going on for eight years now, the territories of the LPR and DPR have been under constant shelling and explosions for eight years, the population would really be happy to peacefully join Russia, not because they want to live in Putin’s regime, but because this could stop hostilities that are not virtually no Western media wrote, around which there were no discussions from foreigners.

My roots grow from there. I grew up there.

I clearly understand why an eastern Ukrainian really has much more in common with western Russians than with western Ukrainians (language, religion, common culture). All these 8 years, many world economies have simply used this conflict to sell weapons to both sides. Now these same economies are imposing sanctions and pretending that what is happening is news to them.

For decades Europe ans States gladly hosted the oligarchs. They sold real estate for cash, provided them with bank accounts and safe deposit boxes, sold their citizenships for money and opportunities to earn money. And now, instead of helping to hold a fair referendum, protect western Ukraine tactically (only way right now) and do everything possible for real diplomatic negotiations, they decide simply wait as long as possible, Right now they are just looking for a time and an excuse to cash in on this war again.

Off topic:In general, it is very important to understand that slavery in Russia is the historical slavery of the white over the white (serfs, camps for dissidents, all these stories about the gulag and work units for prisoners - all this), the same over the same, and therefore it is so difficult to understand exactly how it works and why in this reality you don't even need real racial or religious segregation to oppress for your privileges. Millions of workers and farmers will pay the  war price for the sake of oligarhy without their will or even permission.2) In Moscow it is now difficult to find a person who supports the war. For 99% of the population, this was terrible, cruel, chilling news. A life-destroying event. Yesterday, protests were held in all major cities. Again, a lot of people were arrested, many went to prison, were crippled. The country has been protesting against the government for 10 years, the main opposition leader of the regime has been tortured in prison, since then the generation protesting on Bolotnaya Square has grown up, has families and children. Many of those who spoke at that time realized that it was more important and real to leave and save themselves...

Right now, some European states are curtailing visa centers for Russians.I remind you that 69% of the country has never been abroad and do not have a travel passport to go abroad. It's amazing, but it is this percentage that includes almost all ""pro-Putinists"".

Those people who traveled somewhere, worked, did something abroad - these are 0.01% of oligarchs and officials + mostly the middle class (its remnants), creative and scientific class (intelligentsia), middle office management with an university education - all those who come out and went out to protest despite broken arms and pierced heads. Despite the fear of destroying himself and his family's life, he will lose his job and home. By closing the borders, you isolate these people. As well as Ukraine.

Just imagine that in your country there are several hundred or even a thousand people whose secret wealth is millions or even billions of US dollars. The money of some would quite pass for the whole economy of a small developing country somewhere.

These people have everything: fifteen citizenships of the advanced countries of the world, personal armed guards the size of a battalion of professionally trained soldiers, and most importantly, a whole staff of professionals of various nationalities who are paid really good salaries so that nothing much happens to their money.

Then also there are 90% of the population who literally have no money. None at all. They live paycheck to paycheck, sometimes saving something for a vacation once a year or two somewhere in the Crimea or allowing themselves the luxury of eating in an inexpensive restaurant once a month. Thank God and the Soviet leadership that most have at least some real estate (and you have to pay very little for it) and free medical care with education. Because otherwise it would be a total collapse.

Even if you unite several hundred thousand of these people (which is extremely difficult to do, since almost all opposition leaders are either in prison or have left for other countries), they have nothing to eat, not just making a revolution, they have nothing to eat!

Some of them are not idiots and they are well aware that anyone from the Forbes list will easily hire a thousand conditional ""Taliban"" or ""Chechens"" or any mercenaries who, for a few millions dollars, will really suppress any revolution without ever asking themselves how right it is what are they doing. We are not living in the 18th century now. Barricades on the street are no longer working. Two months ago, Russia allegedly proposed a ban on cryptocurrencies. An unknown investor withdrew 6 billion rubles in one hour, which was \~ 850 thousand dollars. What do you think a small group of special guys can do if they have $850,000 for free purpose?)

Actually it was almost the other way round. Chechens humiliated the Russians but simply lacked the numbers. Russia suffered heavy losses (Check out First and Second Chechen War) fighting them and learned their lesson. That you don't fight these folk, you use them in your fights against others.

Chechens have known nothing but war for centuries. A lot of them are later generations of brutal Mongolian invaders, likes of Genjis Khan (and some of those generations are in Afghanistan and we all know what they did to Russians in Soviet - Afghan war). Some people like, famous Russian chess player, G. Kasparov actually believe that broke the Soviet union more than anything else (the years of humiliation and defeat against tough village-men known as the Afghans)

FYI: Khabib Nurmagedov (Unbeaten UFC fighter) is an ethnic Chechen.

Disclaimer: I'm German so my view might be biased but here goes. It's a shame that the German government, or the chancellor Scholz, are so hesitant in providing (non-financial) support to Ukraine and that Scholz seems to have vetoed (among other countries) the exclusion of Russia from Swift.

Of course, I see that this makes the German political leadership look unreliable as an ally. I don't understand and don't have the knowledge on what are the political motives that motivate the hesitancy in supporting Ukraine. Dependency on gas is rather obvious and it's a shame that Germany seems to be relying on Russian gas. That sucks, I know. 

So I understand when people say that Germany has let down Ukraine.

However, I feel also that there is a perception of Germany being able to stop the war, stop the march on Kyiev. And I'm wondering, is that really the case? Even if Germany (and other countries that have vetoed) would want to ban Russia from Swift, would that really instantly change the course of the war? If not, the notion of ""Germany siding with fascists"", ""being on the wrong side of history"" seems a bit off.",1645795667.0,1645795569.0,t3_t133b8,t3_t133b8,,0,-8,0,-8,0,0,

ce1bda7c0fb73dc7b470b1321aa9b714,t133b8,hydvusn,"I can't believe I'm obsessing over the same conflict in another post. In a time where Russian trolls love to spread misinformation, we must remember the facts don't conform to our narratives. In particular, the parallels between Chechnya and Ukraine.

Chechnya, within the USSR (to my recollection) was an autonomous SSR part of Russia, Ukraine an actual legal SSR, with the latter having a constitutional right to leave (in theory). Ukraine is an internationally recognized sovereign nation; Chechnya was never recognized by any foreign country.

The Chechen Wars were quite different from the current invasion of Ukraine; Chechnya was unrecognized and internationally it was seen as a separatist war; the Russian military was MUCH weaker in 1995 than it is today. Yeltsin was in power in the first war, and there was interwar Chechnya (1996-1999).

As soon as Chechnya was given de facto independence, the newborn country immediately collapsed into an intra civil war. The oldguard Chechen nationalists who defeated Russia were now fighting Islamists for control of the republic, which became lawless. Crime was rampant, kidnappings and carjackings formed a bulk of the economy, and Chechnya became the Somalia of the Caucasus.

In essence, before we get to the crux of the Chechnya-Ukraine comparison, by 1999 there was already a justification for Russia to intervene again in Chechnya. It was never recognized by any sovereign entity, so domestically and internationally, the intervention was seen as business as usual. Small scale attacks and incidents on Russia proper had occurred before the infamous 1999 Moscow apartment bombings.

Did Putin create a false flag incident in Moscow to ascend to power? It's certainly possible, as a plain intervention suddenly galvanized the public, and the intervention in Chechnya was seen in a new light. However, the evidence us still inconclusive, so it's anyone's guess. I lean towards yes, it was purposeful, to solidfy support over a big issue in a slimy way. If I had to take a guess, a certain mission in a Call of Duty game really popularized this (what I'll call for technical purposes) conspiracy theory.

After Chechnya was reannexed by the Russian Federation, Putin put in a local dictator in charge. Those Chechens fighting for Russia have probably been told a much different narrative than most on here understand.

That's not getting into the human rights violations that occurred in Chechnya during this time, which I don't  (unfortunately) have much insight on. But I'll return to in a bit.

Why did I post all of this? Because often, facts don't confirm 100% to our narratives. The mostly Western audience on this subreddit likely has only passing knowledge on Chechnya, yet there's a narrative to group Chechnya and Ukraine as parallels. In reality, this has no basis. We don't want to give Russia more ammo that we ourselves spread disinformation. Putin has done plenty of scummy things, such as money laundering, war crimes, and human rights abuses. We don't need to add misinformation to that vile.

Comparing the Invasion of Ukraine to the Interventions in Chechnya is like comparing an apple to a lettuce. However, what should concern the world right now is the current scale of Russian operations. From the reports, much of the bulk force being used by Russia seem to be the more young, inexperienced, and naïve wave of soldiers (the first ones to use, instead of the more hardy veterans). While Russia has almost certainly committed human rights violations and war crimes, this bunch of soldiers I would wager aren't as bad as what's going go come next.

The soldiers at the border, waiting to be used are contract soldiers. These troops are far more bought in to Putin's ideas than many of the inexperienced initial invading force. In Chechnya, the majority of human rights violations were committed by contract soldiers (or even mercenaries) who were far more reckless towards the people. In the next few weeks, when Russia's elite unites start landing in Ukraine, keep a very close eye. Because these are the soldiers likely to commit rights violations.

Everyone who says ""Putin can do what he wants! He has nukes! Don't make waves and give him whatever he wants!"" seem to forget that Russia isn't the only country with a nuclear arsenal, and those countries would launch all of them at Russia in retaliation if Russia did use a nuclear weapon.

You see, Putin and his oligarch buddies rather like being alive. They've done most of their best evil stuff, and earned nearly all of their money, while being alive. But having dozens of 500 megaton warheads detonate in their cities and over their bunkers would tend to hamper their ability to stay alive, to say nothing of their ability to actually spend money, do evil, and be comfortable. They don't want that...

Unless Russia itself is threatened and Putin is looking at NATO troops through the window of the Kremlin, he stands to gain nothing, and lose literally everything, by using nuclear weapons.

However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schröder fucking around with Russia before. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schröder fucking around with Russia before. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

NATO doesn't even have to intervene with ground troops. Just confining air support to Ukraine and any assest that fire into Ukraine from Russia territory. NATO can assist without declaring war on Russia.

,t133b8,hydnpft,"3) In Russia, there really are some people who historically support Putin. Don't think they like what's going on, they're just used to living in fear, in a paradigm where any change makes it MUCH WORSE. 

A huge number of them are old people who grew up under Soviet rule, who often do not know a single foreign language and live on the verge of poverty, consuming a huge portion of propaganda every day.  
It is these people who tell their grandchildren ""please don't go to the protests, you will be sent to prison, you will lose your job, our family will be destroyed."" 

Don't blame them, they were just born and raised in families where they remember what happened in the 30s. My great-grandmother, divorced my great-grandfather a week before he was put facing the wall and shot in the head. He was a world famous motorcycle racer, one of the first in Europe. And went to Europe. And then they thought he was a foreign agent. He forced her to file for divorce and only thanks to this my grandmother was not taken away from the family and sent to an orphanage.  
She carried him parcels with food and personal belongings to prison daily for five years. She was told that he was alive, but he was killed three days after his arrest.  

I tell this story to you to understanding how these old people feel and how they are afraid for their grandchildren and great-grandchildren and why they themselves do not come out to protest. These people have indeed seen too much death. They are simply intimidated by the future and the terrible today seems to them more understandable, even more monstrous tomorrow.  

4) Right now our families and friends left in Ukraine are writing messages. Indeed, it seems that neither side wants to fight at all. Chechens were put in the vanguard of Russian troops - there are a lot of them now - our Ukrainian part of the family says that there are whole groups formed only from Caucasians, the Slavs do not seem to really want to shoot at the Slavs, but those boys who were forced to go there cannot refuse. They will be shot for desertion or sent to a military tribunal (which is now unlikely, because it is much faster to shoot). Moral really is very low.

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldovan-flagged-tanker-hit-by-missile-ukraine-coast-2022-02-25/

LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Moldova's naval agency said on Friday that a Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker with a Russian crew was hit by a missile near Ukraine's port of Odessa, injuring two people, and that it was unclear who had fired at the vessel.

Vadim Pavalachi, deputy director at the naval agency, told Reuters that the crew of the Millennial Spirit was Russian.

""We just heard 10 minutes ago that all the crew were saved but two were seriously injured and are on the way to hospital,"" Pavalachi said.

The tanker is small at 2,200 tonnes and the second commercial vessel to be hit since the invasion began.

A radiation spike has been recorded around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Data from monitoring stations suggests the levels of radiation increased about 20-fold on Thursday.  
  
“Around the reactor you would normally receive a dose of around 3 units (called microsieverts) every hour - that’s jumped to 65,” explains Sheffield University nuclear materials expert Prof Claire Corkhill.  
  
“That’s about five times more than you would get on a transatlantic flight.”  
  
The most likely explanation, she says, is increased movement of people and vehicles in the 4,000 square km Chernobyl exclusion zone has kicked up radioactive dust that is usually undisturbed on the ground.  
  
Unrest around the now defunct nuclear power plant is alarming, but a repeat of the 1986 nuclear disaster, experts say, is extremely unlikely.  
  
“The radioactivity has decayed significantly since then and the thing that released the radioactivity then was a huge fire,” explains Prof Corkhill.  
  
Of much more concern is any fighting close to Ukraine’s other working nuclear reactors.  
  
Nuclear policy expert James Acton wrote on Thursday that “Chernobyl is inside a large uninhabited space. Ukraine’s other reactors are not similarly isolated"".

""Let down"" is the understatement of the century. Sending \*helmets\* of all things to a country under siege - I mean, are we taking the piss here???

Then: an ex-Chancellor who is so deep in the arse of Putin that he can see the daylight again on the other side. Need I say more? 

Germany IS, for all intents and purposes, an unreliable ally.  The behaviour during the last few decades speaks for that with many, many, many examples.

This whole Ukraine business is just the latest in a number of occasions unmasking what a fucking bunch of hypocrites we are.

Examples:

\- poster boy of environmentalism and fight against global warming: are you fucking kidding me??? Close to double the per capita CO2 emission as compared to France which will stay this way even if the country is plastered with windmills because

\- in our infinite wisdom and self-righteousness we decided that gas (RUSSIAN gas) and coal  (also a lot of RUSSIAN coal) is a better transitionary technology than nuclear, mostly brought to you by a party founded by and still at the base consisting of esoteric nutjobs from upper middle-class backgrounds which only recently discovered how they can very selectively use science to further their moronic nature-worshipping mindset in the broader population. 

\- both-side-ism: even in clear situations always trying to look after both sides, trying to ""understand"" the perpetrator, sometimes even more than the victim. I suspect our national psyche likes that a lot because nearly all of our grandparents or great-grandparents were at least enablers if not outright supporters of the most monstrous regime in human history.

\- paying lip service to European unity and unification, then undermining cooperation or insist on laws and decisions going OUR WAY by outright blocking decisions or blackmailing smaller members into voting with or for us.

I wish we left the EU and NATO, no I wish we were thrown out of both as soon as possible. The others should leave us to fend for ourselves in this hostile world.

Good luck with that, because Germany is a nation of big-mouthed petite bourgeoise afraid of their own shadows that is incredibly dumb and violent only in big crowds or hiding behind the big fella (e.g. US).

Imagine you're an average Russian father. You have an average 9-5 job. You found a girl you liked, got married and had a kid. You're getting older, but not that old just yet. You worked your entire life for rather shit money, but you make do with it. You enjoy playing pick-up sports with coworkers. You don't really get involved with politics, you only care about the price of the 6-pack of beer at the local market and making sure your kid gets good grades. Your kid grew up to be a lot like you, but he went to go to university to get an engineering degree, which you barely financed with your shit job.

Your kid is currently serving his conscription on his 21st birthday. 

He gets sent to Ukraine and dies for absolutely no fucking reason, invading a country for some bullshit reasons that your own government couldn't even clarify. Oddly similar to the U.S. joining Vietnam - but that was at least war that was already being fought for decades and there were morals in play.

Do you think this father is going to be pleased with that? Do you think he'll be happy with Putin and the regime? Currently, Putin has received close to no pushback from his own people, and people who tried to push him back are sent to jail or killed.

Every Russian death is equal to an entire Russian family that wants to cut Putin's balls off.

If enough Russians die, Putin's head will be hung in Moscow. There will be a breaking point. If Ukrainians hold off long enough and kill enough Russians, even in a losing war, Russia will rot and burn from the inside. On top of that, the sanctions and possible involvement from other countries - maybe this is good after all.

I think if NATO gets really involved, there is a chance Putin sticks to his guns. Maybe he starts with a “warning shot” by detonating over Ukraine to make a point? He doesn’t seem shy of holding them hostage. Ukraine isn’t a NATO member so it may not immediately trigger MAD procedures. 

If western countries attack Russia proper, rather than Ukraine, my assumption is it’s very likely going nuclear. Although he probably centralises an offensive decision, defensive employment of nukes must already have been delegated and will be handled locally rather than by Putin alone. 

Another option is if Putin starts losing his war without reasons to officially attack NATO. i.e. if there is enough internal dissent to make an impact. 

Although Putin has employed the last 20 years enforcing lotalty and stiffling free speech, people aren’t dumb. If he can’t achieve significant success and prove to a large enough part of the population that he has, there are risks of backlash internally despite supression. 

Should this scenario put more pressure on him, he may feel like he has nothing to lose and press buttons to go down noisily. We can’t rule out madness.",False,1645798108.0,t3_t133b8,t1_hydp9gn,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

It was an attempt to reduce tensions between West Germany and the Soviet Union (the basic idea was: you don't attack a good customer, and you don't attack your cheap gas supplier). Since that, buying Russian gas has been considered as a profitable way for both sides to keep talking in times of tension. The German view on the topic has been (until yesterday): Buying Russian gas is \*both\* good for profits \*and\* for the security of Europe. That was obviously wrong, but it's a mistake that cannot be fixed in 24 hours. But you might want to recall: in the 70s, Germans were the first ones to die and have their country turned into a parking place, had the Cold War turned hot.

And ""they did nothing to diversify their energy supply"" is wrong. The problem is: gas was/is considered as a transition technology (the idea being that gas power plants can be repurposed to burn green hydrogen some day). Unfortunately, Putin's irrational and ultimately self-harming aggression was not calculated into those plans. That was stupid, in the light of what happened since 2014.

>Kremlin: Russia ready for talks with Ukraine on 'neutrality'  
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that Russia is ready for talks with Ukraine in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, official Russian news agency RIA Novosti reports.  
**But he said this would have to be about Ukraine declaring a ""neutral status"" - which would include ""demilitarisation"". Russia has all along wanted Ukraine to rule out ever joining Nato.**  
Ukraine's president has called for talks with Vladimir Putin but there is no indication that he will agree to talks on this basis.  
Minsk is significant because it's where agreements were signed to try and bring an end to the conflict in Ukraine's east that broke out in 2014.  
By invading Ukraine, Russia's leader is seen as having torn up those agreements.  
Earlier Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said no talks could be held until the Ukrainian military lays down its arms.

Meaning ARMED CONFLICT or DECLARATION.  
..  
Keyword: ""ARMED CONFLICT"", providing airstrikes as support? ARMED CONFLICT.  
THat is an act of war.  


Providing military equipment, intelligence, $, NOT an act of war.  
\----  
So you can see NATO is doing what they can to support Ukraine without actively declaring war of Russia but you see. What we're trying to do is trying to avoid a world war 3 because that benefits no one. Do you know how to prevent it? By NOT engaging with Russia directly.  
Since Ukraine is NOT part of NATO, there's no obligation to defend them with active arms.
