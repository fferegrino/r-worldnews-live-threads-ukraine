Day 404-405 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past couple of days continued to be mostly quiet here in the city, though as usual there were some air raid alerts. The alerts will almost certainly become more common in the coming days because Russians are conducting military exercises with Mig-31k in Belarus, which was also the cause of a couple of alerts today.

Sadly, today there was yet another incident with people mishandling grenades. Some drunk guy was lying on the ground and waving a grenade around. At first people said that he blew himself up with it, but a bit later it was reported that an explosion happened after the guy was detained by the police. I’m don’t think there were any fatalities, as thankfully none were reported this time. It really sucks that incidents with UXO and grenade mishandling are only going to become more common going forward.

Also, it’s great that Finland has finally joined NATO, now they are out of reach of Russian imperialism for the foreseeable future, and at the same time Putin is now officially the best NATO salesman of the century (so far). It’s always amazing to see Russian actions backfire spectacularly, they started this war with the (obviously bullshit) goal to stop “NATO expansion” but instead they got a new country to join the alliance (with more on the way), and at the same time justified its existence for all members.",False,1680649495.0,t3_12b8gmu,t3_12b8gmu,,0,186,0,186,1,0,{'gid_3': 1}

Russia has strengthened NATO in ways that would have been unimaginable to me (an American who reads a fair bit of news) just a few years ago. Increased military spending across NATO countries, other countries clamoring to join, European countries decreasing their dependence on Russian fossil fuel imports, and the thorough degradation/attrition of Russia's military, all in a single year.

That's not to downplay the horrible reality of Russia's war in Ukraine, nor all the suffering the Ukrainians are enduring defending their homes, but it really is remarkable just how badly Putin miscalculated the West's reaction - at least thus far.",False,1680616563.0,t3_12b8gmu,t3_12b8gmu,,0,93,0,93,0,0,

Participation in the Commission will allow Ukraine to join the preparation of the summit decisions and achieve the most acceptable wording for us.

Couldn't help notice the up-tick of ""Its all Russians that support the war"" discussions around the traps. Not a new thing, it's been happening for a while.

While on the surface, you can't help thinking that there is a lot of angry and rightly upset Ukrainians making these posts, there also seems to be an element of ""getting this message out everywhere possible"" to it.

The Kremlin is afraid of Russians turning against them, it makes life easier for them if the ordinary Russian thinks the rest of the world hates them, and may even help stop the mass exodus of people from the country.

If the ordinary Russian manages to poke their head outside of their new ""iron curtain"" and only see's hate staring back at them, it will probably help enforce all the propaganda the Kremlin spews out.

He goes to the bay area where he used to roam as a wee Soviet lad dreaming about the oceans where his father had been stationed as a conscript in the Soviet Navy before making the ultimate sacrifice to the Motherland while fighting Nazis.

Ah yes! The old seafront vista is just how he remembered it, he thinks to himself, as he inhales the briny smell of salt water and gazes across the ocean meadow of the Baltic Sea.

The blue of the waves.

The blue skies above.

But then.... something catches him off guard...

All the not-so-distant shores on the horizon...

*They, too, are blue*.

""I don't want to get nuked, we should do everything to avoid getting nuked.""

Fair, but backwards. Showing the likes of Iran and NK that ""nukes=get whatever you want"" is promoting nuclear proliferation.

""The west is encouraging Ukraine to fight, they should just surrender. It's basically Russia anyway.""

Obviously it's straight from Russian propaganda, but I think this argument is more insidious. To use it, you have to have a colonial mindset. Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for Zelensky, so by having this view you are intrinsically anti-democratic and pro-imperialist. This person is, in my view, actively evil and actively against British values.

""It's complicated, but we should have a dialogue for peace that involves the agreements/borders from 2 years ago.""

A kind of compromising middle, but ultimately naïve . This was offered, Putin said no, so that's it. It ignores that Russia entered a truce breaking war of aggression; without true war goals they can't actually make any peace other than total victory or white peace.

""We're just doing this because it makes the MIC rich, wake up sheeple""

To make an impression that Ukrainian units are everywhere.

But its not wrong.

The Realists have fucked our world.  They fucked the foreign policy of the West for 80 years and achieved literally fuck all.  We still live with the potential of a nuclear exchange (although its fortunately greatly diminished given Muscovy's state of maintenance).  We still let dictatorships do genocides if they are big enough and ugly enough.  We fail to properly protect nations on the border of these nations and we continually fail with every single attempt to appease.

The Soviet Union should have been prevented from ever getting a bomb in hte first place.  But the Realists said no, its not the way to go, let them have their ""sphere of influence"" because fuck knows why a country should have its own sovereignty if its near a larger nation.

But it happened and we lived with it until the 90s and then isntead of fucking **just paying them the fuck off to eliminiate the nukes** the Realists said no, we should just let the shit go down and have Muscovy rule over the wreckage. 

Fortuntely a lot of countries managed to get out during the chaos **despite** the Realists telling the West not to add Poland and the Baltics and eastern Balkans to NATO.   For once they got ignored and those countries found safety.

But for other like Georgia or Chechnya or Ukraine, well here we are today.

Russian-aligned Ukrainian politicians have faced scandal and protest since the early 2000s, where the Orange Revolution put a pro-Western government in power... against opponent Viktor Yanukovych. Fast forward 10 years, and Yanukovych (under the guidance of Trump's future campaign manager) is in office, and sets off Euromaidan over his deference to Russia. The immediate reaction from Russia to Euromaidan is the invasion of Crimea.

Trump gets elected (with the aid of massive internet meddling by two Russian companies run by... you guessed it, Wagner's Yevgeny Prigozhin), and does his whole weird 'lets leave NATO' song and dance, although 'lol be besties with Russia' is still hard to sell at home. The full invasion of Ukraine is planned, with associated troop build ups.

I disagree with you. Russia was unstable (and insane now) and Pakistan is literal [terrorist suporting state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state-sponsored_terrorism). Both are allowed to keep Nukes with no pressure on them to disarm. 

If literal terrorists states like NK and Russia are allowed to have Nukes, then its clear hypocricy that UA was disarmed. 

Same mistake by US was stoping Taiwan from [getting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) their deterrent. Now there is a huge chance a war will break out because of China desire to capture Taiwan.

Second, no country is getting into NATO while in a full scale war with Russia . That's literally asking NATO to go to war with Russia without being attacked. 

>If literal terrorists states like NK and Russia (and Pakistan) are allowed to have Nukes, then its clear hypocricy that UA was disarmed. 

Yeah the situation is really different here. Ukraine had the third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons at the time (1700!) And Russia wasn't very keen on letting those weapons, which they see as essentially for keeping the US at bay, go and they weren't very happy about letting Ukraine be a sovereign state either. If Russia was told the get nothing (none of the weapons and they lose a sovereign state)  it probably would've forced Russia's hand to go to war with Ukraine (that could go nuclear) in the 90s and jeopardize every nation breaking out of the USSR as illegitimate. And an infant government with a shit ton of nukes isn't good for anyone. 

Also if anyone could get Russia to give up their nukes, we would have. The US could leverage Ukraine to give up nukes to avoid war with Russia (at least for a few decades). They obviously couldn't do that to India, Pakistan, or Russia. 

>Same mistake by US was stoping Taiwan from getting their deterrent. Now there is a huge chance a war will break out because of China desire to capture Taiwan

There's always been a huge chance of war between Taiwan and China. Developing nukes doesn't always prevent war; it can lead to heightened tensions encouraging China to make a move before they have a large enough arsenal to threaten them (Iran-Israel and Korea).
