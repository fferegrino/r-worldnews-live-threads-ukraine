Day 22 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today yet another non-stop shelling continued, this time they shelled our biggest market Barabashovo, which has over 16000 stores and is basically one of the places our city is famous for, it caught fire and the black smoke cloud from the fire was enormous. 

Nice military target they got here, will probably say it was yet another Azov’s HQ. Honestly with how much they talk about Azov (who I won’t deny are actual real Nazis) you would think our entire country is Azov at this point, they talk about them so much that it sounds like this single battalion completely eclipses the whole Russian army while in reality it’s at best like 1000-3000 people.

Shelling around my home also continued the whole day today, just 30 minutes ago 3 explosions happened one after another and they were very close to us, the sound was extremely loud and the impact triggered alarms in nearby cars. It’s getting scarier day by day; always keeping essentials by the front door and being ready to run in case of an emergency gets really tiring.

 where I described some of the things in the $800M package.

>I know weapon systems can be confusing, so here's a bit of an explanation (plus another ""bonus"" NFZ comment at the end)   1/17

>First, anti-tank.

>The Javelin is a phenomenal shoulder-fired weapon. It's expensive, but it's  designed to destroy a multi-million dollar tank or personnel carrier (BMP, BTR, etc)

>It has both a side attack & top-down attack mode, and tankers fear this kinds of weapons. 2/

>It can accurately hit & destroy enemy armor at ranges up to 3000+ meters.  But...it also has an ""arming requirement,"" and can't be used against close-in targets during ambushes.  

>For those, a soldier needs an LAW (light antitank weapon) or an RPG.  Countries have variants  3/

>A law is great for ambush, off the side of a road as tanks roll by, & they are inexpensive & easier to carry than an ATGM (Anti-Tank Guided Missile), like a technologically-advanced Javelin, British NLAW, Swedish Robot 57.

>BTW, a Javelin is not a Stinger.  Let's talk that.  4/

>Stinger is the man-portable air defense system (MANPAD).  It's shoulder-fired by one person, requires the soldier to SEE the aircraft and track it until he gets a ""tone"" that there is lock.

>No radar or other equipment is required, and it's relatively easy to train to use.  5/

>Stingers are expensive & provide a unique defense against LOW ALTITUDE aircraft...that is, helicopters and planes flying about 3500 meters away (and that's low).

>A shooter would need to be lucky to shoot down a cruise missile, like a RU Kalibr.  6/

>For higher flying targets, the US used to use a Medium Altitude Air Defense and then a High Altitude Air Defense (HIMAD) system...Chaparall and Nike.

>Those have both been replaced by the very advanced Patriot (and Patriot PAC-3).  

>Patriots are very large systems, extremely expensive and take months to train on to master.

>For all those saying ""let's give Ukraine Patiots"" that's  a good idea...except, they haven't been trained on them & there are tough maintenance and resupply issues.  8/

>The solution - which I believe many in DoD are working right now - is to get former Warsaw Pact countries to ""give"" Ukraine some old Russian systems, like the SA-8 Gecko or the S300 Grumble.  

>Ukraine is familiar with both, and they would be effective...except...  9/

>Both are tough to get into country, both have a radar signature & both require a crew.  They also require vehicle & radar maintenance AND resupply of missiles. 

>But Ukraine's military commanders believe this may be a better solution for ""clearing the skies.""  10/

>Which brings us to No Fly Zone...again.

>Consider:
>-it takes LOTS of a/c to execute a NFZ in a country as large as UKR...several dozens at any time.
>-it requires shutting down RU air defense radars (called SEAD, suppression of enemy air defense). 11/

>-the primary targets are BOTH RU a/c and missile/artillery locations

>-the MIG is ""okay"" at air-to-air, but it's not a great ground support aircraft...requires precision to hit ground targets better suited to drones/counter-artillery.  12/

>For those (especially those in Congress) saying ""just give them F16s & A10s the Air Force doesn't want""....I'd just say...

>You need pilot training, maintenance, support, fuel, and supporters to keep those a/c in the sky.

>It's a large package that can't be delivered quickly  13

>-and additional a/c DURING the fight IS escalatory (I know, many will say ""who cares,"" but it plays into Putin's narrative)...and...

>-is there anyone saying ""yes, I'll take the responsibility for a nuclear attack if Putin does something crazy""?  14/

>Javelins (& others) to attrit vehicles, Stingers (& others) to counter a/c, drones (both Bayraktar TB2 & now Switchblade ""Kamikaze"") to attack artillery & missile launch platforms...

@Podolyak_M on Ukraine’s “cautious optimism” about the negotiations with Russia.

“The main thing for us is that it’s fundamentally not just a peace agreement — this doesn’t suit us. And the old security system, where NATO played a dominant role, doesn’t suit us either. We were moving towards NATO, we were, in fact, their junior partner. During the war we needed advisory assistance — or at least the possibility of accelerated weapons purchases. Then, on February 25 [the day after Russia invaded], NATO didn’t even invite us to their summit. They were afraid. And [now] we understand that this entire post-war security architecture doesn’t work in Europe anymore. The OSCE [like NATO] is also failing to provide security.”

“We have a formula that we’ve put on the negotiating table — a Ukrainian model of security guarantees. It suggests that there will be no bilateral agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but rather a multilateral agreement, a package agreement that a number of countries will take part in — their number is still being discussed. [But it will be] five to seven countries.”

“ In addition, we’re suggesting a Swiss model for the army, with a certain number of reserves that undergo continuous training. This is the best model for a country like Ukraine with a neutral status. The details are still being discussed.”

“ There aren’t 15 points. There are key, basic points: the end of the war, a ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops, security [guarantees] for Ukraine. Everything else is little extras. There are still territorial discussions, but they will be the subject of [separate] negotiations between the presidents, because these are painful issues.”

>On Tuesday, Chinese ambassador Qin Gang published an op-ed in the Washington Post in which he sought to dispel reports that China knew in advance about Russia’s plans to launch a war in Ukraine and reaffirmed China’s position on the importance of balancing respect for countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity with consideration for others’ security concerns.
>
>The embassy posted a Chinese translation of the commentary, which was then picked up by state media and social media accounts.
>
>The following day, a hitherto-obscure account on China’s ubiquitous WeChat social media platform that merely reposted the translation of Mr. Qin’s op-ed, without comment or any other frills, became a gathering point for hundreds of thousands of commenters to debate the Ukraine crisis.
>
>In a rare example of Chinese online discourse openly opposing government policy, the discussion was dominated by messages unambiguous in criticizing China’s position.
>
>“An apparent invasion was defined as a conflict, as if the invader and the invaded each should be blamed equally. With that comes the nerve to say justice is being upheld,” read one of the most popular comments, which attracted more than 2,000 likes.
>
>Another comment, endorsed with more than 2,000 likes, simply asked: “Then why the hell did you vote ‘abstain’?”—a reference to China’s vote on an earlier draft United Nations Security Council resolution that would have condemned Russia.
>
>It was unclear why so many commenters flocked to that one particular account, which quickly attracted more than 100,000 views before all comments were hidden on Thursday afternoon. The account owner didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.
>
>The official WeChat account of the Global Times, a Chinese nationalistic tabloid that attracted a similar number of views for its repost of Mr. Qin’s editorial, allowed only five comments to be visible, all of them either praising the editorial or bashing the U.S.
>
>On China’s heavily controlled internet, voices expressing solidarity with Ukraine have persisted since the war began, pushing back against content praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and lauding Beijing’s position.
>
>Still, such a sustained barrage of domestic opposition against China’s foreign policy is rare. As the top comment on the viral WeChat repost read: “To understand who you’re siding with, just take a look at how public opinion is treated domestically! Pro-Russia posts are always intact! Pro-Ukraine ones are often muffled!”

An American who traveled to Ukraine for his partner’s treatment is killed.

WARSAW — A 68-year-old American man was killed in a Russian assault on the city of Chernihiv, a city northwest of Kyiv, the local authorities in the city reported on Monday.

The local police said the man, James Whitney Hill, was killed by heavy artillery attacks on unarmed civilians in the city. His identity was later confirmed by Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry.

James Whitney Hill, an American who was in Chernihiv while his partner received medical treatment, was killed by heavy artillery attacks on the city on March 14.

Russian forces have been laying siege to Chernihiv, an ancient city of about 300,000 residents, which lies directly along the Russian invasion route from Belarus to the capital, Kyiv. It has come under attack since the first days of the war and, last week, the city’s mayor posted a message online saying that the rising death toll from the fighting meant Chernihiv had run out of room to bury its dead.

Mr. Hill, who went by the name Jimmy or Jim to friends, and his partner, Ira, who is Ukrainian, had traveled to Chernihiv in December so that she could be treated for multiple sclerosis, friends of Mr. Hill told a local news broadcaster in Idaho this month. They had become trapped at a regional hospital there.

While it had been difficult for him to communicate with the world outside Chernihiv in recent weeks, his Facebook page offered a harrowing account of his final days, sheltering with his partner and family as Russian forces bombarded the city.

Mr. Hill wrote in a recent post that Ira was suffering from serious health concerns and had been admitted into the intensive care unit of the hospital. They were eager to leave but had been unable to find a safe route out of the city, he wrote.

“We could try a break out tomorrow but Ira’s mom doesn’t want to,” he wrote in a post on Facebook on Monday. “Each day people are killed trying to escape. But bombs falling here at night. Risk either way…I only have wifi a few hours a day. We have enough food for a few days.”

One day later he wrote: “Intense bombing. still alive.”

But diplomats - especially here in the United Nations, especially here in the Security Council. Compared to the more well-known and understood PTSD there appears to be greater severity and different symptom patterns for those affected by PITS.

The case of the military aggression of Russia against Ukraine and the mass atrocities perpetrated by the Russian army - ordered by Putin and defended by the Russian diplomats - will be examined by scholars and scientists, including in the areas of sociology, history, philosophy, psychiatry and theology

> 
> WASHINGTON—The House easily passed legislation Thursday to end normal trade ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, moving quickly to approve the measure after President Biden announced his support last week.
> 
> The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act passed 424 to 8 on a fast-track procedure that requires at least two-thirds of lawmakers support the measure. The bill now heads to the Senate. That chamber has a matching bill with bipartisan support and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said he would work to move it quickly.
> 
> The legislation would strip Russia and Belarus—a country closely aligned with Russia that has been used as a staging ground for its Ukraine invasion—of their most-favored-nation trade status, a step that would result in higher tariff rates on some imports from the countries.

**French carmaker has one of the largest operations of any multinational in the country but faces risks by staying**

Renault had for months been plotting to export a newfangled version of the Lada to the rest of the world.

Although realising that ambition remained some way off, it would have capped the revival of a brand arguably more synonymous with the Soviet Union than any other and which Renault first took a punt on in 2007 after then chief Carlos Ghosn identified Russia as a promising market.

Encouraged by Russian president Vladimir Putin, Renault in 2012 lifted its stake in Avtovaz, the manufacturer of the Lada since the first one rolled off the production line in 1970, to a controlling one.

A decade on, its success in steering Lada through setbacks and market slumps has left Renault with a larger business in Russia than many other foreign companies, just as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine risks turning the country into a pariah state.

In contrast to some multinationals for whom the Russian market amounts to little more than a rounding error in their accounts, Renault has a local workforce of 40,000 and generates 10 per cent of its revenues there.

The carmaker has not commented on its intentions, saying only that it is monitoring the situation in Russia. The scale of Renault’s operations, alongside a lack of political pressure in France to beat a retreat, has left the group minded to try and stay, according to people familiar with the matter.

**Renault along with its alliance partners are the biggest carmakers in Russia**

But as the corporate stampede from Russia grows, the commercial and reputational risks for the company, which counts the French government and Japan’s Nissan as its two biggest shareholders, are rising.

“People are underestimating the potential economic collapse [in Russia], this could be a complete breakdown,” said Mark McNamee, Europe director at FrontierView, a consultancy that advises companies on macroeconomics.

“There’s pressure for companies to not be seen to be dealing with Russia at all,” McNamee added, pointing to a particularly strong move among US consumer brands to “self-sanction” and withdraw.",False,1647546641.0,t3_tge8fj,t3_tge8fj,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

> 
> “It’s very telling when you walk into Putin’s office, and you see a portrait on the wall of Peter the Great. That’s not there by accident,” Huntsman said. “There’s a sort of emotional connection Putin feels there. He’s a man of empire — not just the Soviet empire but the Russian empire.”
> 
> “He’s [Putin] is a master of escalation. It keeps me up at night just thinking about it. Putin will continue with force, and it will get worse,” Huntsman said. “We have to be extremely careful, so this does not evolve into a confrontation where horrible weapons are introduced to the battlefield like tactical nuclear weapons.”
> 
> “Does this mean Putin begins to have second thoughts about what he’s done? No, that’s not Putin’s style. He’ll double down, and things will get rougher,” Huntsman warned. “I have feelings of tremendous unease about the days and weeks ahead hold.”
> 
> Another important consideration is what happens to Russia if Putin is removed from power. Huntsman says the damage already done to that country from the conflict is immense, leading to greater instability, and the U.S. needs to be prepared.

What else can you expect from a Mafia-state kleptocracy? Subordinates reflect their superiors. Putin's regime is basically a cartel with more legitimacy and resources.

The Russian military has traditionally been the dumping ground for the stupid and useless by design. Competent officers and successful generals mysteriously die. This is to prevent a military coup against those in power. The only reason why Shoigu has been in power for as long as he has is because he's an ethnic minority (Siberian Tuvan) and so can never rule Russia. Thus he's a ""safe"" candidate to hand off control of the military to.

The mistake everyone made at the start of the invasion was assuming that it was one nation's military against another's. The truth is Russia's military hasn't been a true military in the traditional sense for quite some time now. They are essentially a street gang scaled up, just like Putin and friends. Good for scaring civilians but fold like paper under real threats.

This is basically what you get if Pablo Escobar had enough paperwork, propaganda, and manpower to become the internationally recognized ruler of his own country and sold gas/oil instead of drugs.

Putin thinks he's the next successor to the Soviet red tsars.

Russia’s advances are largely still stalled.

One exception: Pentagon assesses Thursday for the first time that the Russians have seized Izyum, a town southeast of Kharkiv and north of Mariupol.

Russia want to cut off eastern Ukraine from rest of country, U.S. official says.

Front end of beleaguered Russian convoy north of Kyiv remains outside city. But Russian forces have moved up artillery, the senior defense official said, as Russia appears to be readying additional fires.

“They’re trying to wear the city down,” senior defense official says.

As of Thursday, the Pentagon assesses that Russia has now launched more than 1,000 missiles at Ukraine. That number continues to climb by several dozen per day.

The Pentagon, even on background, is discussing very carefully whether Slovakia could be “backfilled” with some other kind of air-defense system so they can send their S-300 to Ukraine.

Russia is considering “resupply” from elsewhere, senior defense official says, roughly repeating what he said yesterday. That includes both weapons and personnel.

Senior defense official was asked if it's a national security threat that MTGand others parrot Russian talking points.

Official says that it would be ""going too far"" to say that lawmakers expressing their opinions is a threat, ""whether wrong or right in terms of accuracy.

How long could Russia go? Hard to say, official says.""But they clearly were not prepared to be in the position they are three weeks in, basically frozen around the country on multiple lines of axes.""

Russia appears to be looking for ways to overcome their logistical challenges ""from outside Ukraine,"" official adds.

How soon before Javelins, Stingers and drones identified in aid POTUS approved yesterday will go to Ukraine?

Senior defense official says he isn't sure ""and frankly, I don't know if that's the kind of information we're going to be able to give out publicly.""

>Sociologists of the Ukrainian company “Active Group” decided to further explore to what extent is the Russian society aggressive. To answer it, a telephone (via the Viber messenger) survey was conducted according to the formatted methodology (the sample is representative according to the subject of the federation, sex and age of the respondent). Mandatory language for the Russian environment was used in the drafting of the questions. Thus, instead of “invasion” and “war” in the survey the word “special operation” was used, Ukrainian security forces were called “Nazis” etc. Of course, instead of “in Ukraine” it was said “on Ukraine”.

**Moscow claims western sanctions are forcing country into ‘artificial default’**

Russia’s finance ministry said on Thursday it made $117mn in interest payments due on its dollar-denominated bonds to Citigroup in London, but it was not clear whether the payment would be able to reach investors and allow Russia to avoid defaulting on its $38.5bn of foreign debt.

The ministry added that it would comment later on whether Citi — the payment agent for the bonds — had accepted the payment. The coupon payments were due on Wednesday, and Russia will default if it fails to pay up after a 30-day grace period. One European bondholder said on Thursday morning that he had not yet received the money. Citi declined to comment.

Moscow has repeatedly claimed that western sanctions are preventing it from servicing its debt, with finance minister Anton Siluanov saying earlier this week that Russia was being forced into an “artificial default”. US sanctions, however, say that US investors can continue receiving interest payments from the Russian finance ministry or central bank until May 25.

> **Ukrainian president says Berlin has for years put economic ties with Russia ahead of security**

> Volodymyr Zelensky launched an excoriating attack on Germany over its policy towards Ukraine, accusing its leaders of placing good economic relations with Vladimir Putin over the security of Europe.

> “We’ve seen how many ties your companies have with Russia,” he said in an address to the Bundestag, “with a country that just uses you and other countries to finance its war.”

> Ukraine’s wartime leader delivered the biting critique to German lawmakers on Thursday as Russia’s invasion entered its fourth week, with no let-up in the bombardment of his country’s population centres.

> Echoing recent speeches to the US Congress and the UK House of Commons, the Ukrainian president pleaded for more military support, including a no-fly zone the west has rejected due to fears it would start a world war.

> But Zelensky also scolded Germany’s long-held faith in economic engagement with Moscow, singling out the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the recently suspended project designed to bring Russian gas directly to Europe under the Baltic Sea.

> “When we told you that Nord Stream 2 was a weapon and preparation for a great war, you said it was just a commercial project,” he said.

> Zelensky thanked those companies “that placed morality above profits”. But he also complained that he had long begged “in vain” for help from Germany and failed to win support for Ukrainian membership of Nato. “And even now you are hesitating to admit Ukraine into the EU,” he said.",False,1647545091.0,t3_tge8fj,t3_tge8fj,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

Yes, there are neonazis in Ukraine, and in several other countries. The US has had a resurgence in white supremacist groups, and it is a problem in our military and police. 

It seems that Russia may be a main supporter and instigator of neonazi movements around the globe, as a cheap way to create internal division in countries he views as enemies. Including Ukraine.


 Russia has supported, trained and funded neo-nazis all over the world, and many have gone to Russia for military training with Russian white supremacist groups. 

Richard Spencer and David Duke have spent time there and praised Russian support for their racism. There is evidence that neonazis in Ukraine were trained within Russia and supported by Russia's burgeoning neo-nazi movement.


Russia has been cultivating ties with neo-nazis for years, and supporting their rise in other countries.

>For its part, the Russian government has exploited this interest. It has both turned a blind eye to far-right paramilitarism within its own borders and actively cultivated neo-Nazism in the West. These decisions align with its broader project to sow discord in Western democracies and influence transcontinental relations, despite its relatively weak military and economy. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s support for right-wing violence in the West constitutes an element in his broader destabilization campaign.

We are trying, with the few personnel left, because most of them are gone, to keep Izyum alive,” he said.  
>  
>Valeri Marchenko described to ANA-MPA the damage that the city has suffered. “After heavy aerial bombardment, artillery bombardment, and rocket strikes, essentially our city was destroyed. Entire blocks of buildings became ruins and the electricity, water, gas, mobile, and internet networks were completely destroyed. Monuments of historical architecture and the city museum were burned by the bombs. Churches were bombed.  
>  
>The river bridges connecting the two banks have been blown up. The biggest horror for us is that the Russian army in Izyum is carrying out targeted bombardments of residential areas and apartment buildings. We are trying to document all these actions in order to prove their crimes against humanity.   
>  
>Without exaggeration, I can state that the city of Izyum is now in ruins,” he said, adding that the Ukrainian armed forces “heroically defend the southern part of the city”.

https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamSomething/community

As the war in Ukraine grinds on, I feel like I should take the time to talk about tankies within the Left. Whoo boy.

First, what is a tankie?  
The term originates from the 2nd half of the 20th century. There was a large schism within the Left at that time, after the Soviet union rolled tanks into Hungary and Czechoslovakia when the two tried to break out of the Soviet sphere of influence.  
While most leftists opposed this, there were some weirdos who supported the Soviets in their brutal crackdowns. These were the OG tankies back then.  
  
Second, the Soviet Union back in that time period. It wasn't socialist or communist. It was a fascistic oligarchy, that later transitioned into far-right kleptocracies, with the exception of those countries that ended up with the West.  
Here's the name of the game: build a totalitarian dictatorship with a ruling class of strongmen and cleptocrats, and then put ""The People's"" in front of the name. As such, the People's Republic of Hungary wasn't the people's and wasn't a republic, just like every other country under Soviet military occupation.  
  
Enter modern day tankies, carrying the torch of authoritarianism onward. If you've seen leftists in support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, chances are they were tankies.  
  
The alpha and omega of tankie political thought is ""US bad"" (here ""US"" includes the West as a whole). From this, they extrapolated that anything opposing the US must be good by definition.   
  
Who opposed or currently opposes the US? The Soviet Union. China. Russia. Syria. North Korea. Cuba. The list goes on.  
  
You might notice that these countries all happen to be horrible dictatorships with the aforementioned ruling classes of strongmen and cleptocrats. They disappear people with dissenting political opinions, forming opposition parties or opposing news outlets is either banned or severely restricted, heavy state propaganda is broadcast to the population 24/7, and so on.  
  
Every person with an IQ above room temperature (in Celsius) agrees that these governments are the opposite of good.   
  
Tankies disagree.  
  
Why? Because US bad.  
  
In their minds the US is such a comically overexaggerated evil that even the most horrible actions taken by opposing governments are justified.  
  
China bans forming independent workers' unions? Well, they have to, because those unions would be controlled by the CIA.  
  
Cuba throws political dissidents in jail? Well, they have to, because those people are surely US-puppets.  
  
Russia invades Ukraine after the latter drifts away from its sphere of influence? Well, they had to, they were afraid of US-led ""NATO expansion"".  
  
You might have guessed it already, but tankies aren't leftists. They only adopted the aesthetics of what many consider ""leftist"", i.e. symbols associated with the Soviet Union for the most part. Otherwise they're just fascists painted red.  
  
Leftists don't stan for dictatorships and oligarchies. Tankies do.  
  
Leftists don't condone jailing political opponents. Tankies do.  
  
Leftists don't deny genocides like the Holodomor, or what China does to Uygurs. Tankies do.  
  
Leftists don't support Russian blood and soil imperialistic action against Ukraine. Tankies do.  
  
The list goes on.  
  
Especially now, every effort must be taken to excise these lunatics from the left, and send them off to the far-right where they belong. Otherwise they'll keep festering on leftism like a tumor, making it much harder to bring people over.   
  
Next time you see a tankie, feel free to hurl a creative insult of your choice in their direction. In fact, you should.

TORZHOK, Russia—More than a hundred cars, many festooned with Russian flags and plastered with stickers proclaiming “For Russia! For Victory!” converged on the main square of this small town in a show of support of President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s military operations in Ukraine.

“We support our army. We support our government. We are united behind our state,” said Dmitry Serov, 35, a driving instructor and Torzhok native who was one of the organizers of the weekend rally.

Those sentiments are widely shared among Russians across the country who believe Moscow’s military action in Ukraine is justified, that the West is to blame for provoking the conflict and that the Russian people are being unfairly targeted with international sanctions.
Mr. Putin has said that the military operation is necessary to cleanse Ukraine of anti-Russian nationalists he says have corrupted the country’s leadership with the help of the U.S., and to defend Russians whose culture, language and very existence is under attack.

Moscow’s state media, including influential television broadcasts, the main source of news for most Russians, daily reinforce the Kremlin’s stance.

> 
> Intelligence suggests Vladimir Putin's troops are only making small advances without a major strategic breakthrough in the face of 'fierce and mobile' Ukrainian resistance.
> 
> US sources have suggested that Moscow has suffered around 7,000 dead so far and there are questions over whether the occupying force could absorb the additional losses they would suffer if they tried to storm the well-prepared capital. 
> 
> Officials cautioned against ruling out Putin ordering a bloody direct attack in an attempt to end Ukrainian resistance.
> 
> But they cited the deaths of four senior generals as a sign things are not going well - because top-ranking officers would not usually have to get in harms way to provide 'close-up supervision' of troops. 
> 
> 'They are getting pretty bogged-down around Kyiv. No doubt small gains are being made incrementally, but Ukrainian resistance is fierce and mobile,' they said.
> 
> Sources also confirmed that Russia is seeking to recruit 'additional forces' in the form of mercenaries from Syria and Chechnya - also seen as a sign that its battleplans are failing. 
> 
> Russia has taken heavy losses, with figures based just on visual confirmation alone suggesting 1,380 Russian military vehicles have been either destroyed (598), damaged (20), abandoned (211) or captured by Ukrainian forces (551).
> 
> Ukraine estimates that the Kremlin's armies have lost far more, with Ukraine's Armed Forces saying on Wednesday that over 13,800 Russian troops have been killed.
> 
> Other estimates have put this figure even higher, with the US on Thursday saying Russia has lost up to 28,000 soldiers - killed and wounded - during the three weeks of fighting in Ukraine.

Putin, Medvedev, etc made multiple threats against the west. Called the sanctions tantamount to an act of war (but not actually war, I know), said if the west intervenes it's an act of war, etc etc.

We also know Putin is sorta losing his shit between firing staff and FSB agents.

Beyond that there are suppositions that he's dying, or gravely ill with parkinson's or cancer, his paranoia for both people and disease is at 11.

Articles suggest he isn't particularly close to his adult kids, and denies having young kids with his mistress.

This is absolutely not to fear monger, rather an attempt to paint and share an accurate picture of a man who appears to be spiraling ala Hitler in downfall. I personally don't believe the rhetoric saying he isn't suicidal, irrational, etc and wouldn't start lobbing nukes.

""Nuclear Doctrine

Under Russia’s military doctrine, most recently updated in December 2014, Russia “reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and (or) its allies, as well as in response to aggression against the Russian Federation that utilizes conventional weapons that threatens the very existence of the state.”

U.S. Defense Department officials have said that Russian doctrine includes a so-called “escalate to de-escalate” strategy, which envisions the limited first use of nuclear weapons to attempt to end a large-scale conventional conflict on terms favorable to Russia. However, some experts have called into question whether “escalate to de-escalate” is part of Russian doctrine. ""


Some of these terms seem intentionally ambiguous, and it's a perfectly legitimate concern to question if Russia will respect their own military doctrine when pressed into a corner.

It's a very interesting question. There's some combination of treaties, contracts and a bunch of country to organization laws that are all at play here.

Between countries are treaties. Between a bank and it's customers are contracts and between a bank and it's host country are laws. When customers are themselves countries and banks in other countries it gets pretty complicated fast.

I have no idea if any law blogger is sorting it out like a real-time legal archeologist, but if so I'd be fascinated to see it attempted to be explained.

If anyone knows of such a blogger or professor or article, hook me up. It would be really interesting to see even one case explained between the bank, the host nation, the treaties, and whatever else technically, legally would apply.

Nuclear warheads, compared to almost any contemporary machine, are mechanically simple. You’ve basically got a handful of very stable metals packaged a particular way.

The one major maintenance item is Tritium replenishment due to its low half life, but compared to keeping their missile and space systems running, that’s like filling a bike tire.

Therefore, if there were to be a large-scale warhead failure, it’d likely have to stem from a design issue, which is exactly why nuclear powers only deploy tested models.

The perception that nukes are ‘scientifically hard’ is driven by the massive investment and industrial development required to create the fissile materials, not their ‘tech’.

Ok, so the word for years was that the US was pulling out of the middle east.

If you look at the countries that the US has been in for the past two decades it creates a nice little line. Anyway, Russia sets up a reason to invade Ukraine and China has a reason to invade Taiwan. Russia takes Ukraine and has a fairly solid control of much of the world's food supply. China takes Taiwan and now controls electronics. Saudi seems to have some interest in working with China so the 3 take control of the middle east and now control oil.

Unfortunately, it looks like Russia is grinding their way through Ukraine, albeit slowly. He predicts Kyiv will fall sometimes in April. I kind of have trouble believing it and certainly hope he is incorrect.

It's hard to imagine Russia actually maintaining control over large areas of Ukraine...but I suppose it is plausible if they can quickly get a puppet in place and constantly broadcast propaganda for weeks and months to the people of Ukraine. Eventually, the average Ukranian  could grow tired of insurgency fighting the occupation and accept the puppet government over constant war.

Russia now has a landbridge to the Krim since conquering Mariopol, which the Ukrainians have already reconquered, which is why Russia is bombing hospitals and theaters, that now serve as refugium for innocent civillians that are constantly called to arms by the Ukrainian president.

Putin has cancer, ebola and rabies and is about to be killed by the 10.000 protesters that get arrested every day despite 58% of the Russian population are against the war, which is no war, but only peacekeeping forces.

Russia is running out of young men who are fed to mobile crematoria, which is why they call in merceneries from all over the world, while other thousands of volunteers are fighting for Ukraine.

The Ukrainian infrastructure is broken down, but they still get in all the western armament, which no country is willing to send unless done by their neighbour, which despite supporting Ukraine are evil Russian supporters.

Koch Industries, whose owners gave to right-wing causes for years, is now financing Putin’s war. The people who make Brawny paper towels, Dixie cups, Quilted Northern toilet paper, Vanity Fair napkins and Georgia-Pacific lumber are abetting the spilling of Ukrainians’ blood.

Like Reebok shoes? They’re being used to stomp on Ukraine. Authentic Brands Group, which also owns Aeropostale, Eddie Bauer, Brooks Brothers and Nine West, among others, is in the hall of shame.

Before you bite into a Cinnabon (or Carvel ice cream, Schlotzsky’s sandwich or Auntie Anne’s pretzel) consider that parent company Focus Brands is taking a bite out of democracy in Ukraine.

So is Subway. While selling you the All-American Club, it’s giving Ukrainians the Cold-Cock Combo by refusing to cut loose its 446 Russian franchises.

Several other household brands — Truvia and Diamond Crystal salt (Cargill), Avon cosmetics (Natura), LG appliances, ASUS laptops, Mission tortillas (Gruma) and Pirelli tires — are produced by companies on the shameful list.

Are you or your mutual fund invested in Halliburton, Baker Hughes or Schlumberger? Then you should know that these oil-services companies could deal a huge blow to Putin’s ability to wage war — but they choose profit instead.

Let’s name and shame all the others among the 33: advertising firms BBDO, DDB and Omnicom; accountant Baker Tilly; industrial companies Air Liquide, Air Products, Greif, IPG Photonics, Linde, Mettler Toledo, Nalco and Rockwool; French hotelier Accor and retailers Auchan, Decathlon and Leroy Merlin; German wholesaler Metro; cloud service Cloudflare; International Paper; and Sweden’s Oriflame Cosmetics.

Here we go with this shit.  Every time someone plays this line of thought out they are basically saying 'I'm afraid Putin will end the world'.  Basically this thought process gives him carte blanche to do whatever he wants.  

It's FINE if people don't want to cross certain lines, but the west needs to put down some lines of its own.  Right now they haven't.  So when Putin feels like using chem or bio weapons there will be a big debate about if we should get involved.  And Putin will say ""but nukes..."" and then everyone will be like 'well don't do it again or we will... finger wag again and send more weapons to Ukraine'.

I personally think he wanted to nudge Ukraine back into it's previous position, while sending a message about any perceived weakness on his part. Reason: the [Eurasian Union (or EAU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union).

Prior to to the [Orange Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution) Ukraine's government was aligned with Russia on the formation of the EAU.  In fact Ukraine, along with Belarus, and Kazakhstan were basically the planned original signatories for when it was to go online... in 2015.

The EAU was Putin's attempt to rebuild the USSR (and Russian power) via a new economic block to challenge the EU (and likely China).  However once Ukraine's populace ousted the government and shifted to the EU it more or less stalled the entire thing.  The EAU has added no new full members since the initial signing 2014. (And Ukraine certainly isn't joining)

I suspect Putin's original plan was to try to scare former Soviet Republics that were on the the fence about NATO/EU and yet unwilling to joing the EAU. But it backfired, along with western sanctions (from it) making the EAU untenable at all for anyone not in it.

But rather than accept that he failed in his decades long effort Putin doubled down and targeted the west (Brexit and 2016 US Election) in retaliation and went all in on [The Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) and strong arm nationalism.  And here we are 8 years later and he's watched his near two decades of planning foiled.  So now it's about punishing Ukraine and the world for not letting him have his ""rightful"" (imperialistic) legacy.",1647545645.0,1647545054.0,t3_tge8fj,t1_i11ok1s,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

In Russia, those founding values are things like national good, sacrifice, obedience, strength and endurance. All the nation building myths revolve around a victim complex where the world hates and invades Russia over and over again and Russia endures only through the great personal sacrifice and suffering. 

This is fundamentally what Russians value in a way Westerners cannot understand - its too alien.

The west looks at Russia through the wrong set of lenses and consistently fails to understand their motivations and culture.",False,1647551828.0,t3_tge8fj,t1_i12hw9k,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

now THAT SAID the majority of second-tier content is still pro-Russian and social media is overwhelmingly pro-Russian. I won't believe there's a really serious shift - as opposed to just neutrality + anti-Western incentives - until that stuff starts getting shut down. 

  
Over the last week or so it feels like people have been swinging toward 'Xi is going to help Putin!' or 'China is going to break with Russia on Ukraine' over fairly small bits of information. Wait until we see action. 

  
otherwise I think the line for China is a narrow neutrality with a strong anti-Western bias more than a pro-Russian one 

  
this shift still isn't toward condemnation of Russia as such, but toward reporting on civilian casualties and the war from a fairly neutral stance. 

  
it's also been noticeable that - in official media at least - there hasn't been a lot of \*anti-Ukrainian\* content. The villain is always the United States, with Kyiv portrayed as a victim or puppet at worst. 

that means, for instance, very little of the ""Avov Battalion/Ukrainians are Nazis"" stuff - unless the US can be blamed for it. Here's the one GT story focusing on it, for instance -

They have/had a very strong, unwavering belief in something. I don't know if you ever seen religious documentaries or cult documentaries. This is similar thinking.

It's very difficult to break. I don't understand Putin fully, but from what I can tell, he's totally against western values and he might believe those values will destroy the world. He also is obsessed with just the ethnicity of being Russian. I'm not sure if it's about being white or what, but it's not good because for example, if you look at religious cult leaders, they will do just about anything for their beliefs. And well, most of the world is not Russian...so...where does this go? Nobody knows.",False,1647538245.0,t3_tge8fj,t1_i11hvt8,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The moment they loose that sense of god-given right, that belief that what they're doing is the *only* way and the best way, they die.  

I think what dictators feel is that they are not understood. Nobody ""gets"" them. Anyone who is against them is an enemy. That leads to a narrowing of incoming information. They end up inside an echo chamber. They will also feel that sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. This greater good is, naturally, chosen by them.  

This may be highly controversial for some to accept, but I don't believe dictators wake up each day and think ""Man, I'm evil!"". They think they're right and others are wrong. If one of their schemes fails it is due to others or their enemies interfering.  

For Putin, his nemesis is America. He believes America and the CIA are behind *everything*. You have to remember he is a Soviet era KGB agent. He's incredibly paranoid. He is obsessed with how America and others have toppled dictators. If there's a protest in Ukraine or Russia he truly believes it isn't due to his actions. No, Putin believes it is fomented by America.  

Putin does believe that he is stuck with ruling though, as in no one else can be trusted. When he relinquished some control he had to return and take over as president again to clamp down on people wanting more freedom and for Putin to be removed. That scared the hell out of him. He believed it was America and the CIA trying to topple him.  

If you really want to know how Putin thinks and what makes him tick, watch these two interviews with Julia Ioffe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1HWNcLDK88 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNo2FPQDQw

Russia, quite clearly, is not a superpower, and based on their actions in Ukraine, and their woeful economy over the last decade, they're not even a real power.

Ukraine gave up assurances of their own security when they relinquished nuclear weapons. Russia, post soviet collapse, systematically began either mercilessly crushing movements for independence, or systematically annexing territory for decades. What they didn't act on with hard power immediately they acted upon with soft power.

The simple answer here is that Ukraine had plenty of reason to WANT to join NATO. Either Chomsky believes they should have been denied access, essentially condemning Ukraine to autocratic rule (is he a fan of this?) or he believes Ukraine has no agency whatsoever to act in its own self-interest.

The only remote alternative solution he puts into place is that Europe should have had an inclusionary security aparatus in place for Russia, but how could Europe in good conscience do that in the face of Transnistria and Chechnya in the 90s, and following that up with Georgia and Ukraine in the 2000s and 2010s?

This is inaccurate. (source: I have some tankie ""friends"").

They generally believe in authoritarian communism, because, as they'll point out: ""US freedom and democracy elected Donald Trump. Western democracy elected Adolph Hitler"".

You can't really dispute that, because it's absolutely true. 
Though: it IS kind of a false-dilemma (choice is either: authoritarian communism, or anarcho-capitalism). They want humanity to be free of the shackles of capitalist aristocracy. IMO, not such a bad goal. But it's not worth giving up our individual freedoms for.

As it goes for Tankies who are pro-Ukraine-invasion: sure, they've abandoned reason and in particular, some of the ones I know, are fully believing the ""Ukrainians are Nazis"" argument: Ignoring that the whole accusation stems from Russians who are arguably down with a little ""ethnic cleansing"". They're buying into obvious outrageous lies, in the face of ample evidence that they're lies.   So while they're cute and all, with their soviet-era nostalgia, at the end of the day, their main premise: that post-Leninist Russia was even remotely Communist (or in any way, beneficial for humanity): is blatantly and easily provably false. But it's not based on ""US Bad"".

Encouraging alright nationalist Christian ideology in the West while labelling it's more openly genocidal form in Eastern Europe ""Nazism"" except when it's in Russia itself. 

Working hard to integrate a Stalin-Mao like Communist bloc partnership with China, which is his long term market for all raw materials. New Silk Road can't work without Russia, putting too much on the vulnerable sea ""belt"".  Also Russia is the only country scary enough to create a distraction so big that China can seize Taiwan. 

Running around Eurasia's edges, picking up desperate support from Arab countries that need the food exports, that fear he will flood the China and India markets with oil & gas so cheap that MbS & Iran lose vast revenues, and emphasizing Russia was there and Ukraine was a US stooge on many important conflicts in the past. And raising the bogeyman that India & Pakistan really don't want to rouse the ire of a unified Russia+China but a few minor border disputes are easily settled if Eurasia is integrating.  Whereas the West aggravates these to sell arms. 

There's a fourth game going on we can't see, likely in the Brexit Londongrad money laundry, where Putin+Boris are deciding who gets cut loose so London can continue laundering the Russian money that Brexit made it absolutely dependent on. 

And a fifth, in some very dark corners, assessing if a nuclear war is inevitable given the Wests refusal to renew NPT on its original terms of phasing out all nuclear weapons, and thus considering biological pre emptive strikes.

For those who are nervous about whatever Russia just announced, here is a timeline of things that were going to immediately win the war for Russia: 

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia sent four warships not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and going either through the Horn of Africa, Suez Canal, and the Straight of Istanbul or through the arctic, Straight of Gibralter, Mediterranean Sea, and Straight of Istanbul, either of which route requiring them to get Turkey's permission and eventually taking them to the Black Sea. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING.

Subs - no one is really sure of the state of any of the SLBMs these days, one might argue the are in the better shape of all the systems.

ICBMS - have sat in silos for a long time with god knows what level of maintenance (rockets \*are\* complex items, unlike nukes).

I know, I know, their friendship has ""no limits"" or something like that now.  Just words.  Recent events may well be causing some internal reassessment.  

A paper tiger is not a very useful ally once his true nature is put on global display, so there's little military benefit to an alliance with Russia.  Adding to that, the sanctions make an economic partnership much less lucrative.  Although Russia's energy resources still have significant value, maintaining trade with the advanced economies of the world (which Russia no longer belongs to) will be much more valuable.

Of course, this is all assuming that what China believes is ""rational"" aligns with what I believe is rational.  Maybe not.  Maybe Xi decides that China can shoulder the effort of creating a new world order while Russia just plays the part of a friendly buffer-country.  But he's facing a demographic collapse just like Russia, and his military has no major combat experience, unlike most of the Western world.

(2) Garbage-tier Russian communications are still garbage-tier.

Everything will go great when the plans are played out, but once the situation shifts on the ground, there will be issues.

Those who want to stop Russia’s murderous attack against Ukraine should stop investing in or buying the products of these companies.

Koch Industries, whose owners gave to right-wing causes for years, is now financing Putin’s war. The people who make Brawny paper towels, Dixie cups, Quilted Northern toilet paper, Vanity Fair napkins and Georgia-Pacific lumber are abetting the spilling of Ukrainians’ blood.

Like Reebok shoes? They’re being used to stomp on Ukraine. Authentic Brands Group, which also owns Aeropostale, Eddie Bauer, Brooks Brothers and Nine West, among others, is in the hall of shame.

Before you bite into a Cinnabon (or Carvel ice cream, Schlotzsky’s sandwich or Auntie Anne’s pretzel) consider that parent company Focus Brands is taking a bite out of democracy in Ukraine.

So is Subway. While selling you the All-American Club, it’s giving Ukrainians the Cold-Cock Combo by refusing to cut loose its 446 Russian franchises.

Several other household brands — Truvia and Diamond Crystal salt (Cargill), Avon cosmetics (Natura), LG appliances, ASUS laptops, Mission tortillas (Gruma) and Pirelli tires — are produced by companies on the shameful list.

Are you or your mutual fund invested in Halliburton, Baker Hughes or Schlumberger? Then you should know that these oil-services companies could deal a huge blow to Putin’s ability to wage war — but they choose profit instead.

Let’s name and shame all the others among the 33: advertising firms BBDO, DDB and Omnicom; accountant Baker Tilly; industrial companies Air Liquide, Air Products, Greif, IPG Photonics, Linde, Mettler Toledo, Nalco and Rockwool; French hotelier Accor and retailers Auchan, Decathlon and Leroy Merlin; German wholesaler Metro; cloud service Cloudflare; International Paper; and Sweden’s Oriflame Cosmetics.

An additional 72 multinationals have made only partial pullbacks from Russia, such as reducing current operations or holding off on new investments — actions Sonnenfeld calls “very questionable” and “smokescreens.” Included here: Dunkin Donuts, General Mills, Mondelez (Oreos and other Nabisco products), candymaker Mars, Procter & Gamble, Yum Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell), Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott.

All these businesses could be doing more to stop Putin’s savagery and war crimes. Because they won’t, we all should do more to stop them. Go to Sonnenfeld’s website via Yale’s School of Management to make sure you aren’t funding the businesses that are funding Putin’s war machine — and reward the vast majority of companies that share Zelensky’s belief that peace is more important than profit.

To be clearer-- if Russia is a sinking ship, China trying themselves diplomatically and especially economically\* to Russia is bad for them. 

Even if they can prop up Russia long enough (years) to build pipelines and supply networks, Russia will be reduced to a much much weaker force exporting cheaper natural gas to China (As well as rare earth metals), reliant upon Chinese telecoms infra, banking and payments backbone system, private investment, diplomatic support.

Putin/Russia is very unlikely to accept this- Russia and China has a not so perfect alliance rooted in suspicion and cautiousness.

Finally, even if China and Russia wholeheartedly support one another, that leaves India in a much much more precarious situation, and will actively push them towards the West in the face of Pakistan, lack of certainty regarding Russian arms imports and meeting existing contract obligations, weaker and China aligned Russia means more Chinese aggression vs India, etc.

My parents are authoritarian. That's fine, they just believe that 'under my roof, you'll follow my rules.' It means the end of democracy, permanently or temporarily (such as when martial law is introduced) and that the State tells the people what to do, with little to no democratic accountability or transparency.

Totalitarianism is about the leadership having total control - over the military, police, courts, and media, in order to control the people. Think 1984. This control is then used to mobilise people in some way, for some effort. Think of North Korea and the adulation given to the dear leader, and the hatred for the US or S Korea.

Fascism is a far-right political ideology that rose as a counter to Communism in the late 1800s. Whereas Communism seeks to unite workers and take down capitalists, Fascism seeks to unite the people of one nation or blood against some hated 'other', which is usually other nations or very often internal threats, who seek to corrupt the nation, like Communists or undesired ethnic groups. Like Communism, Fascism tends to be anti-democratic and invite authoritarian and totalitarian tendencies.

> **It’s Time to Expand the G-20**
> 
> By Josh Lipsky, the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center and a former advisor at the International Monetary Fund.
> 
> Because the G-20 operates by consensus, there is no formal way to kick Russia out unless every other member agrees, and that’s not likely to happen with countries such as China and India in the fold. The United States could say it is impossible to meet with Russian leaders and finance ministers who are under sanctions and then de facto dissolve the world’s premier economic coordinating body.
> 
> Countries such as Poland, Nigeria, and Thailand all have larger GDPs than current G-20 members and could bring welcome new perspectives into the group. The economic dynamism and relatively younger demographics of these nations (they all have lower median ages than Germany and Japan) would energize a body that will otherwise go adrift. Adding five more members would bring the G-20’s share of global GDP back over 90 percent, where it was when it first emerged as an international force in 2008. After 20 years, Africa would finally have more than one seat at the table.
> 
> Now, the United States could help lead a reformed G-20, one that acknowledges the world has changed because of Putin but not in the way he had hoped.

Although Ukraine is a beacon of democracy and transparency compared to Russia, it doesn't satisfy the criteria for admission into the EU as outlined in  Copenhagen in 1993. [Membership requires that candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Membership presupposes the candidate's ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria#:~:text=The%20Copenhagen%20criteria%20are%20the,and%20intent%20of%20the%20EU.)

To put it bluntly, although Ukraine has set out on a path towards reform, the sentiment in the Netherlands is that they've still got a long way to go to be deemed admissable. 

Furthermore, recent experiences with Eastern European countries like Hungary and Poland with regards to EU law, transparency and citizens rights have left a sour taste in the mouths of many people in the West. 

Lastly, many people in the Netherlands feel like they've been bailing out southern and eastern European countries during the last few euro crises.

Thermite the switches and switch mechanisms. One side before, one side after you ""switch"" it. 

Flood the low lying track corridors via hydro-sabotage. 

Destroy tresses and bridges. 

Dump gravel/rocks/boulders on wide-open track areas that renders the locomotive and cars vulnerable to attack while they clear the track. This helps if you can ""sandwich"" the train by dumping an entire truckload of gravel behind the train shortly after the train passes so it will not be able to retreat to a safer location while the track ahead it cleared.

IED tied to a pressure switch or tripwire the tracks on the outside of curves so the freshly disturbed earth is hard to see on approach.

Learn how to de-couple a train. Do so just before a major curve the train has to slow down for. Several people can decouple multiple cars. Thermite the couple hinge. This can be done very quickly and by small hit-teams.

Armored locomotives are still vulnerable to molotov cocktails.

Anti-Material rifles are good for unarmored locomotives. Regular rifles are good for them as well. Especially if you hit the diesel tank in the middle of the ME3 locomotives that Russia/Ukraine/Belarus typically use. Shoot it twice low and high. Try to also hit the radiator vents on the side to bleed coolant. 

The cabs might be up-armored and there's often a lot of steel between the engineer and the outside world. Hitting the engineer is not a guaranteed way to disable the train and not every locomotive has an engineer in it. Locomotives are surprisingly simple to operate and have pretty robust controls and fallback controls.

Coal cars are great targets for APIT or HE rounds and grenades. Thermite too. It'll go up faster than diesel and burn longer.

Cargo cars might have explosives in them. They'd be a great target for even tracer rounds. Be careful as you will give your position away when shooting them. Fire a few rounds and immediately book it outta there if you do.",False,1647560924.0,t3_tge8fj,t1_i130bth,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Russia has a border problem,  in that far too many of its borders are with adversary nations. Ukraine puts distance between Russia and NATO and the Crimean peninsula literally physically blocks Russia's access to the Black Sea from its only year round warm water port (never gets shut in by ice in the winter).

If Russia can create a friendly government in Ukraine, that places a huge geographic and political boundary between itself and its most dangerous adversaries to the west.

It was irrelevant if those territories had rich resources or not, what mattered if Russia had opportunity to grab those territories. Those imperialistic ambitions kept Putin popular as long as that land grab wasn’t too bloody ( as long as Russian believed those invasions weren’t too bloody) 

Putin didn’t like Ukraine going democratic/west. So he tried every opportunity to weaken Ukraine. It isn’t about money from Crimea oil. The loses from sanctions due to Crimea annexation are higher than value of Crimea oil. 

It is really pointless to pinpoint exact reasons for this war. Russia was after Ukraine for centuries. Rulers changed, regimes changed, and so did the reasons for Russian ambitions towards Ukraine. Only thing that stayed the same is Russian desire to get hold of Ukraine.

Along with some two dozen similar incidents, the attack was manufactured by Germany as a casus belli to justify the invasion of Poland, which began the next morning. The attackers posed as Polish nationals. During his declaration of war, Hitler did not mention the Gleiwitz incident but grouped all provocations staged by the SS as an alleged ""Polish assault"" on Germany.

I have used organic and inorganic fertilizers for years, both have their pros and cons. Fertilizer is particularly bad at increasing nitrogen in waterways due to run off, causing wide spread algae blooms. This suffocates fish at night as algae respires c02 at night. The mining of minerals is also quite devastating. 

It's a double edged sword. There is no way to sustain the amount of people we have with organic fertilizer. I agree portioning should be a thing, and more technologies are in the works to selectivly fertilize deficient spots instead of spraying the whole field.

In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. ‘How are we to live in an atomic age?’ I am tempted to reply: ‘Why, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.’

In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.

This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs.

Yeah we can do both of those things, but let’s be realistic, Ukraine doesn’t have the convenience of being able to do this. They are being invaded by a country that has a military that is orders of magnitude larger than their own.

Let’s put this in perspective, let’s say for the sake of argument that the USA was put in the same position as Ukraine. Outgunned outnumbered needing as much help as you can get in any form from anyone just to have a slim chance at survival. Under these circumstances it would be a certainty that local militias comprising of both people with combat experience and civilians would form across the country. It would also be pretty probable that these militias would form based on ideology or participation in specific groups. That being said I don’t think it would be too far fetched  to see a militia formed only of members of the KKK or another similar group.

Do these people have a shit ideology? Yeah

The combination of Hollywood ties and democratic ticket are too far left of the center line to get elected. However, a celebrity who ""crosses boundaries"" by running Republican stands a chance.

 >The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing war between Russia (together with pro-Russian separatist forces) and Ukraine. It began in February 2014 following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity, and initially focused on the status of Crimea and parts of the Donbas, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The first eight years of the conflict included the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014) and the war in Donbas (2014–present) between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists, as well as naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and political tensions.

See quote from the US when discussing the resolution, which the US proposed in the first place:

> If, in response to our resolution, the Member States do actually establish a system which ensures that aggression will be promptly exposed, if they maintain a collective strength, and if they have both the will and the way to use that strength promptly in case of need, then a third world war may be permanently averted ... It would be vastly reassuring to all who love peace if here we could adopt unanimously a programme which only aggressors need fear. ... We must organize dependably the collective will to resist. If the Security Council does not do so, then **this Assembly must do what it can by invoking its residual power of recommendation** ... As the world moves in the path that this resolution defines, it will move nearer and nearer to the Charter ideal.

and from the UK:

> The Soviet Union ... has attributed to the Council a power which it has never had under the Charter, namely, the power to insist that, because the Council has itself been reduced to impotence in the face of aggression by disagreement among its permanent members, **the entire world Organisation shall wash its hands of the whole matter and let aggression take its course. The Council has never possessed any such right.** Indeed, it is impossible to conceive that the authors of the Charter at San Francisco would have lent themselves to a proposition so far out of tune with the hopes and wishes of the peoples of the world. ... This resolution should help to make aggression less likely by giving notice to any intending aggressor that he risks uniting the world against him ... All the peace-loving nations must welcome the strengthening of the forces of peace which the passing of these resolutions will represent.

>In 2023 and 2024 we anticipate coal-fired generation to decline by one-third in total compared to 2022, enabled by four main factors. First, coal capacity is due to be retired according to the approvedcoal phase-out plans (down from 35 GW at the end of 2020 to 30 GW in 2022 and less than 26 GW in 2024). Second, renewables continue to grow (by 11% in total over both years). Third, according to our model analysis, we expect Germany’s net exports to decline and the country to become a net importer of electricity for the first time since 2002.

>However, potential measures by the new government entering office in December 2021 might affect the outlook for the coming years.

I don't really see the change in Putin others claim to see. I think that not being aware of who Putin truly is, some wishful thinking and people and governments not paying enough attention to Putin's actions are the reason for the perceived change.

It was adopted 3 November 1950, after fourteen days of Assembly discussions, by a vote of 52 to 5, with 2 abstentions.[2] The resolution was designed to provide the UN with an alternative avenue for action when at least one P5 member is using its veto to obstruct the Security Council from carrying out its functions mandated by the UN Charter.

The [resolution](https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/ufp/ufp.html) allows the GA to take direct action, including military action under the UN flag and command (UNC) when necessary. Nobody has a veto in the GA:

This is a major part of why Europe is so weak. Numerous redundancies across many nations. The main advantage of an EU army is to eliminate these redundancies and have a strong unified force. Of course that requires eliminating the individual militaries themselves.

Key to note though an amphibious demonstration is basically you rattle the saber and 'show blitz' (so to speak) by giving the enemy the impression that you are going to conduct a landing, without actually intending to do so. 

STRATFOR might be off, but they're usually pretty accurate but key to note that one of the three your link shows on the map is the Reagan, which is not at sea... they are in Yokosuka which is a US Naval Base and in the text on your link it states: 

""USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) is in port in Yokosuka, Japan, conducting its annual winter maintenance availability. The carrier began a four-month selected restricted availability in Yokosuka on Jan. 13, following a five-month deployment in the Middle East and the Pacific."" 

So, not at sea off China. More like undergoing maintenance in port in Japan... and wont be available until May at the earliest. The Navy normally has 3 carriers available out of the 11. 

It's also not at all weird for us to have 2 CSG's or 1 CSG and 1 ASG in the West Pacific. It's more normal than not. That's a busy spot for our Navy.

Edit: Looked into it a little more.

There are no wheels to turn in a tank, so you would be using the wheel to simulate the feeling of turning from left to right but all it’s actually doing is controlling how the two tracks are moving in relation to eachother.

Not at all, the US failed to achieve it's desired *political* objective in all three cases (which is why my post mentions not confusing political objective with military victory/defeat).  But that isn't getting it's ""ass handed to it"", which implies a military defeat.

Vietnam:  The desired political ""victory condition"" was a stalemate, with a two state solution identical to Korea (which the US had *just* left).  There was never an intention to defeat the North Vietnamese government.  However, every single military engagement was an overwhelming US/ARVN victory.  Tet 68 was an unmitigated disaster for the North Vietnamese.

Afghanistan:  Further attempts at nation building, and letting ""allies"" do much of the heavy lifting (see Tora Bora) but, again, from a purely military perspective the US did not get it's ""ass handed to it"", and for the most part ran roughshod over it's opponents.  Something that was made painfully obvious based on the speed the Taliban retook the country *after* the US withdrawal.

Iraq:  Not sure why this is on the list.  US/Coalition forces crush the Baath regime to quickly, they had to stop to let logistics catch up.  Nobody was prepared for the speed at which Iraq fell.  Follow on to that, the insurgency would flair up and then be put down (see Fallujah), again not what I would ever characterize as ""getting their asses handed to them"".",False,1647544893.0,t3_tge8fj,t1_i11zraa,,6,10,0,10,0,0,

Then the Cypriot government fired their own auditor and did nothing about it. My money via Paypal helps to wash the trail of Russian laundered money in Cyprus.

That's how easy it is to launder money. A Russian game developer moves to Cyrpus buys 20% stake in the bank that they use. Then apply for EU golden passports for their employees, half of whom are not their employees. Take Russian money and wash the trail via your company's subsidiaries engaging in wash trade transactions of empty vacant lots in Cyprus. Use $$ earned through Paypal to pay out the Russian money.

Many U.S. defense primes, such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, and other contractors maintain their own foundries, most of which are certified as trusted suppliers to the U.S. government as part of the Department of Defense’s Trusted Foundry Program. An American stronghold over power and analog semiconductor devices is the primary reason why manufacturing in this case has been kept onshore. Drivers in the analog semiconductor market differ from those in digital semiconductors, which are characterized by longer life-cycles and lower capital equipment requirements. These defense-related semiconductors are largely untethered by advancements in the broader commercial market for state-of-the-art capabilities. However, as weapons systems require increasingly advanced chips, U.S. primes may have to lean on Taiwan for compound semiconductor manufacturing in the **future**.
