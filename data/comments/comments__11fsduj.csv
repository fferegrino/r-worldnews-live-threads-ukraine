Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 2 March 2023  


* As Ukrainian forces continue their defence of Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, rising temperatures are now creating the muddy conditions known in Ukrainian as ‘bezdorizhzhia’, limiting cross country movement (CCM).  

* Poor CCM typically provides some military advantage to defending forces.  

* Daytime soil temperatures have risen and are now largely above freezing. As experienced since mid-February 2023, overnight freeze and daytime thaw remains likely until next week.  

* Forecast warmer than average conditions for the remainder of winter and spring will further reduce CCM.  

* It is almost certain that by late-March, CCM will be at its worst following the final thaw. This will add further friction to ground operations and hamper the off-road movement of heavier armoured vehicles, especially over churned-up ground in the Bakhmut sector.

>**Two U.S. Citizens Arrested for Illegally Exporting Technology to Russia**

>Two Kansas men were arrested today on charges related to a years-long scheme to circumvent U.S. export laws that included the illegal export of aviation-related technology to Russia after Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and the imposition of stricter restrictions on exports to Russia.

>According to the indictment, Cyril Gregory Buyanovsky, 59, of Lawrence, and Douglas Robertson, 55, of Olathe, owned and operated KanRus Trading Company, which supplied Western avionics equipment (i.e., electronics installed in aircraft) to Russian companies and provided repair services for equipment used in Russian-manufactured aircraft. Since 2020, the defendants conspired to evade U.S. export laws by concealing and misstating the true end users, value and end destinations of their exports and by transshipping items through third-party countries. For example, between November 2020 and February 2021, the defendants received avionics equipment, including a computer processor bearing a sticker identifying Russia’s Federal Security Services (FSB), from a Russian company for repair in the United States. The defendants concealed the true end user and end destination by providing a fraudulent invoice to the shipment company identifying the end destination as Germany.

>As further alleged, on Feb. 28, 2022, the defendants attempted to export avionics to Russia. U.S. authorities detained the shipment, and the U.S. Department of Commerce informed the defendants that a license was required to export the equipment to Russia. In an April 2022 communication, Robertson expressed to a Russia-based customer that “things are complicated in the USA” and that “[t]his is NOT the right time for [more paperwork and visibility].” Subsequently, in May, June and July 2022, the defendants illegally transshipped avionics through Armenia and Cyprus to Russia without obtaining the required licenses.

>The defendants are charged with conspiracy, exporting controlled goods without a license, falsifying and failing to file electronic export information, and smuggling goods contrary to U.S. law. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of exporting controlled goods without a license; up to 10 years in prison for each count of smuggling; and up to five years in prison for each count of conspiracy and falsifying export information. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Day 371-372 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were pretty much entirely quiet, but sadly towns close to the border/frontline, such as Kupiansk, were still getting shelled. Also, the fucking bastards hit an apartment building in Zaporizhzhia during the night, it was around 1:40am and they aimed at the 5-floor apartment building this time. 

Judging by the destruction they used an S-300 missile, as 3 floors were destroyed, which basically lines up with the destructive power of an S-300 missile, that can destroy 1-3 floors with a single missile. It was definitely not a Kh-22, as that one can easily level a 12-floor apartment building in one hit, though apparently Kh-22 missiles were fired in our direction earlier today, and they were aiming at Kremenchuck with them again.

That entire chain of events with apparent “incursions into Bryansk oblast” in the morning today was so bizarre that I’m not even sure what to say. The story changed so many times in the span of an hour that it’s hard to even follow. The number of people that invaded changed at least 3 times, then the number of hostages and dead civilians changed a bunch of times as well. 

Some people even resurrected out of nowhere, apparently a school bus driver, along with small boy and girl, all died and then lived somehow. But then there was yet another plot twist, there was no school bus driver, because *school is not actually open* because of war(wait, sorry, a “special military operation”). It was a deputy governor who said that schools were not open, who was then corrected by someone else, who said that *some* schools were open. How the hell does a *deputy governor of a region* not even know if schools are open in his region? 

Well, anyway, in the end they said that no kids died, and then somehow it actually was some far-right Russian group, which fights against Russia, that invaded Russia (???). The whole situation just makes absolutely no sense, we really need time for it to develop some more until we can say what really happened, because right now it’s a clusterfuck of events, which was obfuscated further by Russian reporting. And hey, just recently there was also that hit on a town near Moscow, which apparently developed the Iskander missile, so that’s some amazing news, even though we don’t actually know what was hit yet.",False,1677795045.0,t3_11fsduj,t3_11fsduj,,0,136,0,136,0,0,

18f77564ecd9869810e28b55000462e1,11fsduj,janfavk,"It's important to see today's Bryansk even in the larger context. Internal Russian sentiment is hard to gauge in the English-speaking internet as it invariably relies on third-party summaries. Third-party summaries are rare lately because even those that read Russian like myself are disgusted by Russia and rarely venture into Russian social media.

Having said that, there are [twitter](https://twitter.com/666_mancer/) accounts and telegram channels that specialize in these summaries. The sentiment changed dramatically in the past three months. A never-ending flood of obituaries is all over Russian social media, and comments under those are often extremely critical. Pro-Russian war bloggers also greatly increased the amount of criticism.

We also know that FSB is watching these like a hawk. A joint investigation by Meduza, Radio Liberty, MediaZone etc published a [detailed expose on ФГУП «ГРЧЦ», FGUP GRChTs](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/02/10/a-wild-boar-trained-by-yandex), a huge department hiding behind a cryptic abbreviation. Their 2022 budget was 20.5 billion rubles, with a b, or $265M. They employ about 5,000 people. While supposedly dealing with ""monitoring legal compliance"" they really monitor social networks in all countries and languages, and as of 2022 their chief goal is ""fighting fake news about the special military operation"". 

FGUP GRChTs publishes a daily report that is spread far and wide that covers multiple categories of social media sentiment worldwide, broken down by War Crimes', Civilians Killed', Personnel Losses', POWs, etc, and most notably 'opinions on the president' broken down into Health, Negative Sentiments, etc. They even have internally-developed software called Oculus which deals with image processing and sorts memes into categories like ""insulting images of the president"" and ""comparison of the president to negative characters"".

Long story short, both FSB and Putin have their fingers on the pulse. They know exactly how Russians feel about him and about the war, and they have spreadsheets of names. 

Last week Putin said the words 'witch hunt' for the first time. The full quote in his speech was ""*The West will try to divide our society and bet on national-traitors. Those who directly betray and commit crimes against our territorial integrity will be held legally responsible. This will not be a witch hunt*."" Those who know Russia and Putin should immediately have their hackles raised. 

And yesterday he had a widely publicized speech to the Expanded FSB Collegium, thousands of FSB operatives gathered in a giant hall. The speech was long and culminated in the following:

> Countering the terrorist threat remains an urgent task. Over the past year, the number of such crimes has increased. It is obvious that this is connected both with the attempts of the Kyiv regime to use terrorist methods – we are well aware of this, they have been using them in the Donbas for a long time – and with the desire of the West to revive the cells of extremists and terrorists, their old friends, so-called, in quotation marks, on our territory.
> 
> And we know that they never disdain to use both radicals and extremists in their interests, despite all the loud statements about the fight against international terrorism. Against us, they always use what is at hand, what is possible, then they use it. It's always been that way - and it's the way it is now.
> 
> It is necessary to effectively respond to all these challenges, together with law enforcement agencies and under the coordination of the National Anti-Terrorism Committee, act decisively and offensively, use the entire arsenal of operational, analytical and other means.
> 
> We must prevent any actions by those who would divide us using separatism, nationalism, Neo-Nazism, or xenophobia. They've always tried to do this to our country and they have never been more active than now. They're trying to activate all this scum hiding all over our land.

This sentiment is very new for both FSB and Putin. They're paranoid, with sources. Their September mobilization ended in disaster. The war effort is floundering. They need another wave, and a lot of Russians are already pissed. 

It's hard to predict the scale but it's obvious that an internal wave of terror is imminent, likely alongside forced mobilization of hundreds of thousands more men.",1677780812.0,1677780217.0,t3_11fsduj,t3_11fsduj,,0,78,0,78,0,0,
1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,11fsduj,jald32k,"The Kremlin—pushing its new false narrative of being ‘saviors’ has the Russian news publish a story of a couple who fled from Makiivka to Russia. 

It doesn’t go well.  Not even the Russians believe they save anyone, instead, they think the man is a coward, that they were never victims, they’re not Russian, and this whole war is a s-show. 

The Kremlin portrayed the couple as very much wanting to go to Russia—leaving a week prior to invasion—but the rest of article portrays Russians as inhospitable and awful—no one will help these “refugees” (no agency, bc they’re not russian), no one will rent to them, because they’re Ukrainian.  She talks of missing her family, trusting it’ll all be better, being patient, looking forward to a “bright future”... Not even the Russians believe the characterizations. 


Note, when Russians want to invade, its bc “Donbass is Russian.”  When those inhabits want or expect to be treated as Russians—they’re treated as “others,” suspiciously, not “fellow Russians,” not even “second class Russians.” 


> [1] This lady's husband preferred to run away to Russia, and become a businessman, instead of defending his homeland. Meanwhile, the Russian men are in the trenches, instead of him, dying.  What for? no one knows why.

> [2] Well, the authors didn’t ask him what he considers his ‘homeland.’ And who does he consider defenders, and who he considers attackers. Only that he ‘protected his family,’ he took them to a ‘peaceful’ place [not his home—bc Russia isn’t home to them.]

> [3] Escaped to Russia to wait for “paradise” promised by “our leader”?  Long wait.

> [4] Wait, so you were in a war zone the last 8 years, but only want to move before we come?  And why was it necessary to go to Russia? You should have gone to Germany a year ago [nazi reference].  But you had a Ukrainian passport and a small child. ok, Germany may not be the best, but there are 100 more countries better than the Russian Federation!

> [5] But why didn’t your husband run away from the SVO, when your homeland is in danger! Shame and shame!!! Such a ""man!”

> [6] Today you hear louder and louder: “We must be patient! No excesses! A terrible threat hangs over all our heads! And these words are repeated not only by propagandists, but by many of the simplest people, defenders of “Putin's stability”, which, however, has not existed for 12 years already, but the legend about it lives on and on.
They urge us to endure all this for the sake of a “bright future”, “independence” and because of the “danger” lurking—yet, none of them are trying to figure out what could have prevented all this—with the colossal opportunities that Russia had for two decades, to create this very independence. It’s squandered. What kind of danger are we talking about, anyways? Where did they even unearth the threat to our country, and what specific “bright future” are we moving towards?

> The Answer given is that the ‘enemies interfered with us.’ Enemies? Yes, they who exported everything abroad, it was they who bought luxury real estate in Europe, it was they who forced our government not to invest in the economy, forced our poor ministers to become corrupt officials and imposed such a low standard of living on us that everything fell apart. 

> > [*response to 6*] For as long as I can remember, we had to be patient and wait... and not wait a damn thing has come of it.

The three agencies will issue these advisories on an ongoing basis.

>“Ever since Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Department of Justice’s priority has been the robust enforcement of U.S. export and sanctions laws and cracking down on efforts to evade those laws,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew G. Olsen. “Companies are our first line of defense, and today’s joint compliance note will inform the private sector about enforcement trends and convey the Department’s expectations as to national-security related corporate compliance. We are proud to partner with BIS and OFAC on this important effort.”

>**“Those who attempt to prop up Putin’s war machine by evading our export controls and sanctions will be held accountable,”** said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod. “As this first-ever joint compliance note makes clear, it is incumbent upon industry to maintain effective, risk-based compliance programs. BIS, in coordination with our partners, including at OFAC and the Department of Justice, will continue to use all tools at our disposal to prevent bad actors from circumventing the comprehensive export controls put in place to deter Russian aggression.” 

>“Our economic tools are constraining Russia – so much so that the Kremlin has tasked their intelligence services with finding ways to get around international sanctions and export controls,” said OFAC Director Andrea M. Gacki. “The private sector is an essential partner in ensuring that we cut off Russia from accessing much-needed equipment to continue their unjust war against Ukraine. By issuing a joint alert, our enforcement agencies are illustrating the importance of a risk-based approach that protects the international financial system from abuse by Russia.”

James Rubin, a coordinator for the Global Engagement Center, a US state department body set up to “expose and counter” foreign propaganda and disinformation, made the remarks during a European tour this week.

“The well has been poisoned by Chinese and Russian disinformation – it’s pernicious,” said Rubin, a broadcaster and former official in the Clinton administration and broadcaster.

Six weeks into the job, he said his aim was not just a passive rebuttal of Russian-Chinese disinformation on Ukraine but to go on the active offensive by urging countries not to harbour those that have been exposed for spreading disinformation.

He claimed Russia and China were spending billions of dollars in an effort to manipulate information but said Beijing was operating globally and spending more than Moscow.""",False,1677742611.0,t3_11fsduj,t3_11fsduj,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

""What a fatal encouragement it would be to the perpetrators if we rewarded this assault on international law and the European order of peace.""

In a half-hour speech, Scholz promised, not for the first time, irrevocable support to Ukraine for as long as it takes. Military and humanitarian aid to the country has now cost the German state 18 billion euros. But those costs, he says, are necessary to curb Vladimir Putin's ""imperialist ambitions"", which also threaten European security.

The Chancellor addressed the entire Bundestag, exactly one year after his historic Zeitenwende speech. Then, just after the start of the Russian invasion, Scholz broke radically with decades of German pacifist politics.

He's the Pentagon reporter for the WSJ, and the article is behind a paywall, but that's basically it:

>WIESBADEN, Germany—The U.S. is hosting members of the Ukrainian military here for a weeklong war-planning exercise, designed to help Kyiv game out its strategy against Russia in the next phase of their war.
>Dozens of members of the Ukrainian military are participating in what is often referred to as a wargame or a tabletop exercise, held at a U.S. military base to give the Ukrainian forces an opportunity to assess their next courses of action in the war, now in its 13th month

-----------------

>The wargames are in effect scrimmages, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley said, to test assumptions and possible outcomes in the war and help Kyiv decide how best to proceed. Multiple iterations of the exercises have been conducted this week using maps and different sets of scenarios, he said. 

---------------------------

>“No one is sitting there telling the Ukrainians, go left and go right, or do this or do that,” Gen. Milley said. “That is not the job of the international community; all we are doing is setting up the framework and the dynamics to allow the Ukrainians to self-learn.”",False,1677807508.0,t3_11fsduj,t3_11fsduj,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

>A year ago, our delegation of Ukrainian parliamentarians sat at the U.N. headquarters in New York as a seemingly surreal but all too familiar situation unfolded: the Security Council was listening for hours to Russia propagandize about “8 years of genocide in Donbas committed by Ukraine,” while all the couloir talk was about the imminent invasion Moscow was about to launch.  
>  
>In the face of the war that followed, the U.N. has been helpless to assist. The Security Council could not take any decisive action because Russia was able to block everything.  
>  
>The war unleashed by Russia in Ukraine has exposed an overdue need for a radical reassessment of the U.N. and its Security Council, organizations that have proven unable to fulfill their promise to ensure global peace.  
>  
>Since 1991, Russia has had a seat at the U.N. absolutely illegally, being the only participating country that has neither signed the organization’s 1945 founding Charter nor ever been voted a member by the General Assembly. Instead, its place in the U.N. is the result of a tacit consent that has lasted more than three decades.  
>  
>That tacit consent has allowed the Kremlin, among other things, to block any efforts in the Security Council to help Ukraine amid increasing Russian aggression since 2014. In fact, over the years, Russia (including its predecessor the USSR) has used its veto 143 times: more than all other permanent members in the Council, including China, combined. This has reduced the main peacekeeping world organization to a mere powerless observer.  
>  
>It took a full-scale invasion for the world to begin talking about this biggest swindle in the history of international politics, but a year later, the problem still hasn’t been addressed.  
>  
>While Russia has invaded the sovereign territory of Ukraine and committed mass acts of killing and torture of civilians, the U.N. has failed—and without change, will continue to fail—to provide any meaningful response.  
>  
>**Russia’s undeserved seat in the U.N.**  
>  
>According to Article 4 of the U.N. Charter, new member states must be admitted by a vote of the General Assembly. But Russia avoided this by claiming to continue the membership formerly held by the USSR.  
>  
>That’s despite the Supreme Soviet of the USSR proclaiming on Dec. 26, 1991, that “the USSR as a state and as a subject of international law ceases to exist.” More than a dozen new independent states emerged after the Soviet Union’s dissolution, Russia being just one of them. Others like Georgia and Belarus, for example, had to be approved by the General Assembly to join the U.N., but Moscow simply changed the nameplates from “USSR” to “Russia Federation” and hoped the world would look past it.  
>  
>While the concept of successor states has a long history, when it comes to U.N. membership, only Russia has gotten away with tacit rather than formal consent to take the place of its predecessor. When Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia each dissolved, every one of the countries that emerged from those former blocs had to be admitted to the U.N. by resolution before the General Assembly.  
>  
>Russia’s illegitimate presence in the U.N.—and even worse, as a permanent member of the Security Council—has had disastrous consequences. It exploits the U.N. both as a platform for its propaganda and to block via veto power any attempts by the international community to counter its predatory behavior.  
>  
>Without restoring the rule of law within its own organization, the U.N. will become more and more irrelevant, just as the League of Nations did when it failed to react to the Third Reich’s invasion of Poland in 1939. An impotent U.N., unable to prevent wars and fulfill its peacekeeping obligations may too eventually vanish, leaving a void in the architecture of global security.  
>  
>This is the time to change direction. If not, authoritarian regimes around the world won’t miss this moment of utter weakness by the world’s institutions to fight back.

>The video from the Bryansk region was recorded by nationalist Denis Kapustin (better known under the pseudonym Nikitin). He founded the neo-Nazi clothing brand White Rex, organized mixed martial arts tournaments and participated in the fights of football fans.

>Details. In the early 2000s, Nikitin and his family moved to Cologne. Der Spiegel wrote that Nikitin's family moved to Germany as Jewish refugees, a few months after the move Nikitin received a permanent residence permit. In Germany, he became interested in fighting without rules and football culture. He himself said that ""he was a street kid, a skinhead, he beat his muzzle."" A few years later he returned to Russia and became a member of the CSKA fan movement. “I don't like football, I like scuffle. I can't name a single player, I don't know the history of the club, I had a hard time finding the stadium. I like adrenaline, running around the city, exits to the clearing, action, ” said Nikitin.

>▪️Der Spiegel reported that Nikitin's age indicated for MMA fights does not correspond to the date indicated in his documents. In 2019, at the competition, he reported that he was 30 years old, but in fact he was then four years older.

>▪️After returning to Russia, Nikitin continued to communicate with Cologne fans. In 2014, he was a suspect in a case initiated by the German police after a fight between the ultras Cologne and Schalke. In 2016, Nikitin was one of the organizers of a mass brawl between Russian and English fans in Marseille during the European Football Championship.

>▪️In 2008, Nikitin created the White Rex clothing brand. As design elements, the brand used a veiled image of the ""black sun"", considered a Nazi symbol, as well as the numbers 14 and 88, referring to Nazi slogans. “Out of context, many White Rex posts do not immediately look like they are promoting white nationalist ideology. Rather, the posts and products use coded references to Nazi symbols. In a Facebook post from September last year, a female model shows off a T-shirt with the caption: ""SS for Sweet n' Sexy"",” White Rex described in a 2018 Facebook Huffington Post .

>▪️Before moving to Ukraine, Nikitin organized MMA tournaments in Russia. “There is no nationalist rhetoric at Nikitin's events, but it is rather difficult to imagine an anti-fascist as a spectator or participant. As in the Zentsov section, only those who already have specific views come to these tournaments. At the 16th ""Spirit of the Warrior"" (""Spirit of the Warrior"" - Nikitin's MMA tournament - approx. ""Agency"") in the Moscow ""Wings of the Soviets"", the famous nationalist Maxim Martsinkevich (nicknamed Tesak) entered the ring, among the public you can see people in tattoos that leave no doubt about their ideological affiliation, and some events are even hosted by the aforementioned Roman Zentsov (leader of the ultra-right Resistance movement),” Kommersant described these tournaments.

>▪️Tournaments organized by Nikitin were also held in European countries, they were attended by representatives of local ultra-right movements, for example, the National Democratic Party of Germany or the neo-fascist CasaPound in Italy.

>▪️“Nikitin became a key figure among right-wing extremists in Europe,” Robert Klaus, a researcher of far-right movements, described him. The German police called Nikitin one of the most influential activists in the neo-Nazi environment.

>▪️ The Ukrainian edition of Zaborona wrote that Nikitin moved to Kiev in 2017 and opened the Reconquista club, where hand-to-hand combat tournaments were organized. The publication wrote that nationalists from around the world, including the United States, came to the club.

>▪️ In an interview with The Guardian, Nikitin showed anti-immigrant views: “If we kill one immigrant every day, it will be 365 immigrants a year. But in any case, tens of thousands more will come. I realized that we are fighting the effect, not the root cause. So now we are fighting for minds not on the street, but on social networks.”",False,1677762941.0,t3_11fsduj,t3_11fsduj,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Basically Russians will be conscripted forcefully and told they will only defend the border not go into Ukraine. Obviously once they are there they will also be sent into Ukraine based on the needs of the Russian army but they will be more easily tricked into conscription if they believe they will be in a quiet area at the border instead of in bakhmut.

- A false flag operation was planned involving hostage taking, dead children, anti-Russian proclamations and leaflets etc.

- Units on the ground who could unknowingly interfere were moved away from the area,

- Someone leaked the information, and instead of the fake Ukrainian saboteur group an actual saboteur group made up of Russian volunteers entered the area exploiting the lack of Russian units in the area and the false flag op had to be called off,

- Russian propagandists did not know that and started spreading information about alleged multiple hostages, school bus being shot up, etc. as planned, which also explains Putin's weird ramblings about ""attack on our history, traditions and language""

- FSB has no idea who leaked the information

Setting: artillery unit, that is using Ukrainian villages for target practice. Recently they have days without shooting. Lack of ammo, lack of orders. Discipline - non existent.

Time: one of those days. When people are drinking and then they ran out of alcohol. 

Bright idea emerged. They are defenders of motherland, it counts for something.

Let's allow representative from Bryansk FSB to explain what happened next.


>""They came to the village store, they didn't want to pay money, they started demanding money like defenders of the fatherland. They were told to fuck off, and then a fight or shooting started there. I don't even know what unit they were from but it happened this morning,"" says a Russian army officer.

Let's see what Volya has to add:
>A source in the Federal Security Service also confirmed that in the morning of March 2, soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces who went AWOL, local residents and the police clashed in the border area near the villages of Sushany and Lubechane. Nothing is known about the casualties.

>Russian artillery units have been stationed on the borders of the Bryansk and Kursk regions since spring 2022, ""training"" new recruits by regularly shelling Ukrainian border villages from Russian territory. As many army officers told us, discipline in these units is not too good. Junior commanders and instructors drink, beat up soldiers, and, in the absence of shells, leave their units and go on adventures in local villages.

>If this was indeed the case as described by our sources, then the hostage-taking story may well be related not to the RDK, but to the Russian artillerymen who went on a rampage.

There is not any other sources that publishes this information at this level of detail and in this frequency.

Closest you might get is the group that tracks equipment loss based on public ally available photographs. In that case you still wouldn’t have casualties though, and if no one takes a picture it doesn’t get counted.

Of course the risk is that you just spread Ukrainian (made up) propaganda. They could have a really crappy day and they only cause 35 casualties, but not to freak everybody out they just publish 600 instead of 700 casualties that day. No doubt, them releasing those numbers is a kind of wartime propaganda as well, even if the numbers are accurate.

But their totals seem to match that of other sources, so that gives less reason to distrust the daily increments. Sure, they could lie, but if actually there were only 5000 dead Russian soldiers we’d see that confirmed elsewhere, plus the Russians would be in Lviv by now.

Define hostile. Russia wasn't hostile to Germany per se and Russia would have been willing to trade with Germany just the same,- it was Germany which, ***for very good reasons***, changed its relationship towards Russia. 

But hostile? Difficult in many regards. Going by classical tell signs  eg the USA was maybe just as hostile (or even more hostile) towards Germany in the last 20 years than Russia and helping the USA wouldn't be called treason in Germany.

And yes, the failure to intervene in Rwanda was terrible. It also came on the heels of the failed intervention in Somalia.

You're also missing the nuclear treaty that Clinton achieved with North Korea, that was then sadly and expectedly completely ignored by GWB after him.

And you're also missing how Clinton had the insight before 9/11 to know that Bin Laden was worth all efforts to pursue him. Which Clinton did. For which he was criticized and even mocked for by conservatives... Who then fell asleep at the wheel after Clinton, resulting in the likely avoidable tragedy of 9/11.

And again, add to that also getting the US in and out of Kosovo to the acclaim of Europe without a single soldier death in combat. A record that as far as I know is much unmatched among presidents for that kind of intervention. And achieving lasting peace in Northern Ireland, which is something that had eluded US presidents and other world leaders for decades.

Just look at what Russia has been able to achieve abroad using its media, troll farms, and ties to various icons or figures in the west. 

Putin's speech is just words, and the apathetic Russians can tolerate some abstract mantras about evil western forces (if they even listen). It's still distant enough that it doesn't effect them. 

Reddit, along with western social media in general, really tends to vastly overestimate how many Russians are actually paying attention to this situation, even listening to Putin's speeches, or thinking about the consequences.

As another counterexample, consider VP Dick Cheney. He basically ran the GWB presidency, and had a lot experience in federal level foreign policy going back to Richard Nixon. He then had a big hand in the disasters that GWB signed off on.

Also consider the many foreign policy disasters under Ronald Reagan, in which case then-VP GWHB Bush was largely responsible. As he was basically running the foreign policy for the Reagan presidency, especially during the last 4 years when Reagan started to check out.

And as a relatively positive overall counterexample, consider Barack Obama. Definite mistakes in his term, but also a lot of foreign policy advances that are thought quite well of. And advanced US standing around the world after the previous disasters of GWB. Also, no prior governorship *or* federal level experience to speak of.

Basically, from my point of view, it would be great if we could rely on any kind of previous government experience *or* private experience as being better for president. But I don't think we can.

It does mean something. It means you were wrong to say gulagu was my source on that. I don't care whether you believe or disbelieve the statement: I didn't get it from Gulagu and that's why it's relevant here.

Even the Russian government has come out and said those claims were BS - again, try vetting your sources and not believing random things you see on twitter.

> I cited you my actual source

A source in a government that has publicly said - Ukraine disavows all actions on Russian territory.  If your source says - I will lie to you about this specific thing for security reasons so don't believe me - and then lies to you about that thing you don't believe them.

> I didn't get it from Gulagu and that's why it's relevant here.

Okay, so if the argument is ""Gulagu lied about the false flag"" and the Ukrainian government has admitted they will lie about Ukrainian actions in Russia and say it's a false flag - then why are you citing the FSB preparing a false flag as a point in support of the FSB letters?  We know one side is lying - they said so - and we know one side is wrong - history showed us that - so how is any of this relevant to the FSB letters being BS or Gulagu being non credible for publishing them?

> I said I was done here

Clearly not

> but you lied multiple times

I know English is not your first language (that much is obvious) but you might want to look up what the meaning of the word lie is - you clearly don't know it.

Anyways - about that GRU time machine, I really want to see that Moldova invasion on May 9th of last year. I've neever seen an invasion carried out on fake humanitarian airplanes that Ukraine wont shoot down (for some reason), so they can start a war with Moldova without any way of supplying their troops with ammunition or food.  Tell me more about this super plan they have, what are they going to do - bring an entire war's worth of ammo and thousands of troops on a couple airplanes?  I am sure Russia, a country that has to supply their troops in Transnistria via commercial airlines for a year now can just ask them to ship some artillery ammo and a few tanks - no problem at all.",False,1677787373.0,t3_11fsduj,t1_jant56r,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Tass dot ru, it's the top story right now. Another lie from you. I know what a lie is, thank you, and you keep on telling them


You're asking me why the plan the FSB made to seize Chiçinau hasn't happened yet. All kinds of reasons, mainly, because we are so very lucky that they are fucking stupid. Of course their plan relied on wild success elsewhere. Of course they make and store plans that don't end up happening.


One letter gave the example. Say, the fsb are asked : if a meteor storm hits russian prisons, is the state prepared? If you've read the letters then you'll remember this bit. The FSB answer - yes of course we are! Because who wants to go round looking at prison roofs?

По данным губернатора, были атакованы еще два приграничных села - Сушаны (по нему запустили беспилотник) и Ломаковка (минометный обстрел).
По информации собеседника ТАСС в силовых структурах, диверсанты напали и на Любечане, и на Сушаны, между которыми по прямой примерно 15 км. Речь идет о нескольких десятках вооруженных людей, уточнил он.
В Центре общественных связей ФСБ сообщили, что вылазка украинских националистов пресечена. Их выдавили на территорию Украины и нанесли по ним артиллерийский удар.
В Климовском районе Брянской области идет разминирование взрывных устройств. Ситуация контролируется правоохранительными органами.
Жителям села Сушаны не запрещено его покидать.

No, that's not what that line says either. It says officially (not independently, officially) the information is unconfirmed- i.e. it's a rumor.

Specifically gulagu said FSB would stage Bryansk, and you'd like to see them proven wrong, and therefore you're concluding that it wasn't staged.
