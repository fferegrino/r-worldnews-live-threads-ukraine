Day 465-467 of my updates from Kharkiv.

These past few days were a complete shitshow. There were multiple missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv and its oblast, the one from 2 days ago was targeting Balakliya and hit in the middle of a civilian neighborhood, killing at least 1 and injuring 9 more people. I think there was also a missile strike on Chuhuiv, but that one didn’t do any real damage and there were no civilian casualties, though apparently some people heard the explosion all the way from Kharkiv.

Then there was another missile strike yesterday, one aimed at Kharkiv. At 11pm they fired 4 S-300 missiles from Belgorod, 2 of them detonated in the air over their own city, the other 2 managed to reach Kharkiv, but thankfully nothing important was hit and there were no casualties. The first missile landed on one of the main streets in the center of the city, it damaged water pipes so some people have no running water right now. The second missile landed on the parking lot near the airport, most likely damaging some cars.

The destruction of the Kakhovka dam is an absolute disaster, and Russians are the absolute scum of the earth for doing it. It won’t stop the counteroffensive, but it does limit our options somewhat. The brunt of the damage is being inflicted on the civilian population and the ecosystems, dozens of towns are completely flooded, mostly those occupied by Russia. So far there weren’t any reports of civilian deaths, but an uncountable number of animals is dying from the flood which is a fucking tragedy.

It's stupid that Russians are even trying to accuse us of blowing up the dam. For us doing it isn’t advantageous, it does stop the water from flowing to Crimea, but it also cripples our own agriculture, so it’s incredibly stupid to do so. The Russians even passed the law just a week ago which prohibits investigations of disasters on facilities such as hydroelectric plants and dams, that’s pretty much self-indictment, just how obvious can they be? Their soldiers straight up gloated about destroying the dam and said that more of them need to be destroyed, that’s basically a repeat of the situation with the MH-17 when Russian-backed terrorists shot it down and were posting the evidence on social media for everyone to see before realizing what they’ve done.

* Over the last 48 hours there has been a substantial increase in fighting along numerous sectors of the front, including those which have been relatively quiet for several months.

* Concurrently, the feud between Wagner Group and the Russian MoD has reached an unprecedented level. For the first time, Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin has claimed that the army has employed deliberate, lethal force against Wagner units. Following an altercation, Wagner has likely detained a Russian army brigade commander.

* Most of Wagner's forces have now been withdrawn from Bakhmut. With Russia short of reserve units, the degree to which Wagner remains responsive to the MoD will be a key factor in the conflict over the coming weeks.",1686029036.0,1686028847.0,t3_1422z48,t3_1422z48,,0,94,0,94,0,0,

>*by CNN: Natasha Bertrand, Alex Marquardt, Jim Sciutto, Jennifer Hansler*

>US and western officials see signs that Ukraine’s long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia is beginning and have noted a “substantial increase in fighting” in the east of the country over the last 48 hours as Ukrainian troops probe for weaknesses in Russian defensive lines, a senior NATO official said on Tuesday.

>While preliminary attacks, also known as “shaping” operations, have been underway for at least two weeks, Ukrainian forces have in the last several days begun testing Russian positions with artillery strikes and ground attacks to find vulnerable areas they can break through, the NATO official and a senior European military intelligence official told CNN.

>The destruction of a sprawling dam in Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Kherson region, which triggered a wave of evacuations on Tuesday as floods of water spilled from the Nova Kakhovka hydro-electric plant, could complicate some of Ukraine’s plans, officials told CNN.

>The dam’s destruction could now make it more difficult for Ukrainian troops to cross the Dnipro River and attack Russian positions there, said two western officials. And the dam’s collapse has already created a significant humanitarian challenge into which the Ukrainian government will need to address and funnel resources.

>“Anything that may have been planned downstream from the dam probably has to be replanned,” a European ambassador in Washington said. “Ultimately, the water levels will recede, but most likely, the catastrophic flooding has impacted the bridges and roads in the area, so they may not be usable in the way as planned before.”

>The US and the western intelligence community are still examining who is responsible for the dam’s destruction, but officials are leaning toward Russia as the culprit, the official said.

>Over the last several days, analysts have seen some notable Ukrainian operations and probes in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia, between the southern city of Kherson and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the NATO official said. Ukrainian forces are also conducting operations south of Donetsk city in eastern Ukraine, which appears to be a new effort, the western official said.

>The counteroffensive is expected to be carried out on multiple fronts, a senior US military official said. The official added that “there are many moving parts to synchronize” before a major ground operation can be launched. The weather has also played a role and delayed Ukraine’s initial attacks on Russian defensive lines.

>Ukraine’s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar told Ukrainian television on Monday that an offensive is “taking place in several directions.”

>The European official noted that Ukrainian military will “have to find one to two gaps” where they can punch through and advance, pushing Russian troops aside before they can move in with a larger force.

>It will be difficult to determine when these shaping attacks end and an offensive begins, the NATO official said, and the world should not expect Ukraine to announce that it has begun a major military operation; Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said as much.

>Ukraine also has been sharing less information about its military plans with the US since hundreds of classified Pentagon documents leaked online earlier this year, including some that described Ukraine’s military capabilities and operations, a defense official told CNN.

>But Russia, for its part, remains “seemingly unable to launch a significant offensive of any kind,” the NATO official added, giving Ukraine an advantage as troops probe for gaps in Russian defenses.

>Still, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is tempering expectations. He told The Wall Street Journal last week that he believed the counteroffensive will be successful but was not sure how long it will take, especially without advanced western fighter jets. Ukraine will soon begin training on F-16s and other fourth generation fighter aircraft in Europe, but it could be months before the aircraft is in country.

>“Everyone knows perfectly well that any counteroffensive in the world without control in the skies is very dangerous,” Zelensky said. “Imagine what a military man feels, knowing he does not have a ‘roof’ and he can’t understand how neighboring countries have that.”

>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley also told CNN that he believes the Ukrainians are “very well-prepared” for the offensive. But, he added, it remains “too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen.”

At two o'clock in the morning, the Russians blow up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, but they don't see how much. It's not very visible, but it can still hit.

1. The Russians still think that they have neatly blown up a small part of the HPP and are flooding our military on the islands. At 6:06 a.m., the head of Nova Kakhovka, Leontyev, said that the explosion of the GES was nonsense. Like, we don't know why the water rose there.

2. Russian OSINT intelligence community Rybar picks up the thesis and says a small area was blown up at 6:51 a.m.

3. At 6:51 in Nova Kakhovka, they see that the dam is a complete ass, and the mom's stratagems start to realize that they are in trouble. The mayor of Nova Kakhovka abruptly changes his rhetoric and says there was no explosion, it was a shelling by the Ukrainian army. 

4. But the propagandists, who do not know what the fuck has happened, continue to work according to the methodology and continue to throw into the information space that the dam was previously shelled, and then it got a little tired and broke a little. Here is a post by Podolyaki's propagandist. And the propaganda channel War on Fakes

5. Other telegram channels that cooperate with the military are happily hopping on one leg, cheering, because of the undermining of the Kakhovka dam, the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the islands are flooded, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to evacuate and escape, and then they publish joyful reports of how they are hitting the positions of our guys on the islands. 08:25 

6. Here, the Russians are slowly realizing that they have created a large-scale man-made environmental disaster, almost as large as Chernobyl. And they are starting to reverse. Russian influence on the information space is changing its tone dramatically. They instantly change their tune and start accusing the Ukrainian side of provocations. Like it's a Bankova operation A reference to the same ""war on fakes"" that said the dam had somehow collapsed on its own.... 
But even in their excuses, the racists still screwed up. Either the dam was blown up, or Olha was shelled with MLRS....

Depriving Crimea of a significant amount of water as a result of this undermining already raises the question of whether they are seriously considering retaining Crimea?  
The last time before that, the dams on the Dnieper were blown up by the Nazi troops leaving in 1943.  
A separate issue is the supply of water to the Zaporizhzhya NPP, but the power engineers assure that they can handle it for now - the plant has its own separate cooling pool, and so far there is enough water there.  
From a military point of view - undermining the HPP, an attempt to prevent the Ukrainian Defense Forces from forcing the Dnieper through the system of islands in the Kherson region.  
The idea is strange, given that we would not be able to transfer a large number of troops there anyway - technically difficult.  
But, apparently, a small number of troops - already a serious problem for Putin's command - want to close their flank and focus on the defense of the Melitopol-Dzhankoy line - and this despite the fact that on the left bank of the Dnieper since last autumn, they have been intensively digging defensive structures.  
Will not work.)  
About the scorched earth tactics, when they, preparing to leave, destroy large infrastructure facilities and create ecocide, I'm not talking about it - it's too obvious.  
This is another proof that not just a single Putin soldier should remain on our land - Putin's system of government of the Russian Federation should be completely deprived of the opportunity to harm us across the border, after the departure of all its troops.  
There are various options for this solution:  
\- from the creation of a demilitarized zone on the Russian side to the surrender of the Putin regime to a state where it will no longer be able to launch cruise missiles at us across the border of Ukraine.  
Or better yet, regime change.

>**Drone footage appears to show central section of Nova Kakhovka dam missing**

[Julian Borger, Dan Sabbagh - The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson)

The Guardian article:

>The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnieper River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding.

>As aerial footage circulated on social media, showing most of the dam wall washed away and a massive surge of water heading downstream, the army’s Southern Operational Command put up a Facebook post, accusing “Russian occupation troops” of blowing up the hydroelectric dam.

>“Currently, the scale of the destruction, the speed and volume of water, and the probable areas of inundation are being determined,” the statement said.

>The disaster happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the Dnieper.

>“The purpose is obvious: to create insurmountable obstacles on the way of the advancing [Ukrainian army] … to slow down the fair final of the war,” a Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “On a vast territory, all life will be destroyed; many settlements will be ruined; colossal damage will be done to the environment.”

>Local Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied that anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying that the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure.

>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday in the wake of the disaster.

>“Russian terrorists,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land.”

>“Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror,” he added. “It’s only Ukraine’s victory that will return security. And this victory will come. The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else.”

>Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson region, posted a video to Telegram in which he said that as a result of the damage to the Nova Kahhovka dam, “water will reach a critical level in 5 hours” and that evacuations have begun. Russia’s state media news agency Tass cited emergency services saying 80 settlements could be affected.

>A Russian military blogger, Rybar, said 11 out of 28 spans in the dam were destroyed after explosions at 2am, though this could not immediately be verified. Another blogger said there were no reported missile attacks on the dam prior to the breach, while videos circulated on Russian channels were said to be of civilians evacuating.

>Vladimir Leontiev, the head of the Russian occupied administration of Nova Kakhovka town, on the southern bank of the Dnieper, initially denied that the dam had been blown up, according to Ria Novosti news agency, but he was later reported to confirm there was “damage” and blame it on shelling.

>Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed representative from regional emergency services as saying the collapse was a result of a catastrophic structural failure.

>“The dam could not stand it: one support collapsed, and flooding began,” the representative told Interfax, adding that there were no attacks on the hydroelectric power station overnight.

>Last month, it was reported that water levels in the reservoir had reached a 30-year high, as the Russian occupiers had only kept relatively few sluice gates open, according to experts.

>David Helms, a former US air force and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist who has monitored the dam said on Twitter: “The Russians allowed the reservoir to fill to record levels; if the dam failed “naturally”, it certainly failed due to 6 weeks of over-topping and stress on the structure.”

>The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnieper downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people would lose their homes.

>There could be two further dramatic side effects, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could also be severely affected.

>A Moscow-backed official in the Zaporizhzhia region was quoted by a Russian news agency as saying there was no “critical danger” to the plant yet.

>The dam, a Soviet power project, was completed in 1956 and was 30 meters high, holding back a vast reservoir of 18m cubic metres of water. It sits about 20 miles upstream from Ukrainian held Kherson, but modelling suggests if it collapsed flooding was away most of the islands in the Dnieper River delta and low lying land on Russian held southern bank.

>Zelenskiy warned last November that Russia was plotting to blow up the two mile structure and that doing so would cause “a large-scale disaster” affecting people living downstream.

>Blowing up a dam can be considered a war crime, the Geneva conventions say, if it “may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population,” and the effects of a large release of water on people and homes remains for now dangerous but uncertain.

>Ukrainian military intelligence also warned in November that Russia had conducted the main mining works as long ago as April 2022, but warned that the floodgates and supports of the dam were further primed in November as Ukraine’s forces closed in on Kherson. “Now everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack,” Zelenskiy said at the time.

>The country’s military intelligence also said in November that “dozens of Ukrainian settlements, including Kherson” could be affected by a breach and that “the scale of the ecological disaster will go far beyond the borders of Ukraine and affect the entire Black Sea region”.

>The bridge over the dam was one of only two crossing points over the Dnipro south of Zaporizhzia city before the war. The other, the Antonivksy road bridge at Kherson, was destroyed in November by the retreating Russians, and Russian snipers target anybody lingering on the waterside near the remaining bridge span.",False,1686031021.0,t3_1422z48,t3_1422z48,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

>Key developments on June 6:

>* Russian forces destroy Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant

>* Large-scale flooding  triggers evacuations from Kherson Oblast

>* Kakhovka dam breach causes damage to environment, infrastructure

>* World leaders denounce Kakhovka dam breach as war crime

>* Zelensky: Ukraine to receive 'significant number' of F-16 fighter jets

>The dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant across the Dnipro River, occupied by Russia, was destroyed in the early morning hours of June 6, sparking a humanitarian and environmental disaster in southern regions of Ukraine.

>According to Ukraine's Southern Operational Command, the dam was destroyed by Russian forces.  Later on, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksii Danilov said that it was blown up by Russia's 205th Motorized Rifle Brigade.

>The Russia-installed proxy in Nova Kakhovka first denied that the dam was destroyed, only to claim later that it was targeted by Ukrainian shelling.

>Danilov refuted Russia's claims, saying that the Kremlin prepared plans for the sabotage already in the fall of 2022.

>According to Ukrainian officials, the dam was mined in October 2022 when Ukrainian forces were advancing in Kherson Oblast.

>The breach released floodwaters toward villages and towns downstream of the dam, leading authorities to order evacuations.

>At 9 a.m., Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin announced that the villages of Tiahinka, Lvove, Odradokamianka, Ivanivka, Mykilske, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Bilozerka, and the  Ostriv district in Kherson were ""fully or partially flooded.""

>As of yet, no civilian or military deaths have been reported as a result of the event.

>According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, between 35 and 70 settlements can be flooded.

>***Large-scale flooding  triggers evacuations from Kherson Oblast***

>By the evening of June 6, at least 1,335 houses were flooded on the Ukraine-controlled west bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on June 6 at 7:30 p.m. local time.

>""As of this hour, we know of 1,335 houses on the right bank that are underwater. On the left bank, (Russian-occupied) Pischchane, Stara Zburivka, Kozachi Laheri, Kardashynka, Krynky, Hola Prystan, and Oleshky are partially flooded. Korsunka and Dnipriany are completely flooded,"" Prokudin said.

>Some 1,368 people have been evacuated from the region by 6 p.m. local time, according to the governor.

>In the city of Kherson, two districts have been flooded and over 600 residents have been evacuated, Kherson City Military Administration Head Roman Mrochko announced in the afternoon of June 6.

>Victims of the flood are being evacuated to other cities in Ukraine. The evacuation is ongoing.

>There is also an increased danger to life in the oblast due to mines that may have been dislodged by the flooding.

>***Kakhovka dam breach causes damage to environment, infrastructure***

>The destruction of the Kakhovka dam represents not only direct damage to Ukraine's infrastructure but can have serious ecological and economic consequences.

>As the most immediate effect, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant was completely destroyed by the explosion.

>The flooding from the breached dam also puts Kherson Thermal Power Plant at risk, Energy Ministry reported on June 6.

>The Kakhovka Reservoir, covering an area of 2,155 square meters and with roughly the same volume of water as the Great Salt Lake in the U.S., is expected to disappear in the next two to four days as a result of the breach.

>The reservoir was an important water source for southern Ukraine, as well as for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's biggest nuclear plant.

>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is monitoring the situation at the nuclear station, there is no immediate danger of a nuclear disaster.

>The draining of the reservoir will, however, lead to much of the agricultural land in southern Ukraine losing its main source of water.

>Some experts believe that vegetable growers in the affected region may lose 20,000 hectares of productive land, and the price of wheat has already risen by 3% following the disaster.

>According to Zelensky, the dam destruction will also cause large issues with drinking water even for those areas that haven't been flooded, including in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

>The environmental damage is further aggravated by the 150 tons of machine oil released into the Dnipro River.

>The real extent of consequences will be better known once the flood level recedes roughly in a week, Zelensky added.

>***World leaders denounce Kakhovka dam breach as war crime***

>Many world leaders and international organizations have condemned the Kakhovka dam's destruction as Russia's war crime.

>""The destruction of civilian infrastructure clearly qualifies as a war crime - and we will hold Russia and its proxies accountable,"" European Council President Charles Michel wrote.

>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called it ""an outrageous act which demonstrates once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine.""

>According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, civilian infrastructure should not be a target during wartime.

>The European Union has already pledged to support Ukraine through its Civil Protection Mechanism, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on the evening of June 6.

>In cooperation with its member states, the EU will supply dirt water pumps, fire hoses, mobile water purification stations, and boats.

>Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has called for further actions, namely sanctions against Russia's missile and nuclear industries.

>Kyiv also plans to bring the matter forward at a UN Security Council meeting and to the IAEA Governing Council.

>***Zelensky: Ukraine to receive 'significant number' of F-16 fighter jets***

>President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press conference that Ukraine will receive a ""significant number"" of F-16 fighter jets, based on discussions with European partners, Suspilne reported on June 6.

>""I am very glad to receive the information, I had a lucky day. Usually, we have to negotiate for one or two at a time, but now we received a significant offer,"" Zelensky said.

>The president added that the deal still requires consent from the U.S., which manufactures F-16s, and no details or specifics are currently being disclosed.

>The U.K. and the Netherlands agreed on May 17 to build the ""jet fighter coalition"" to provide Ukraine with F-16 aircraft and train Ukrainian pilots. By now, the initiative includes eight European countries and the U.S.

>Zelensky hopes to make the coalition official under the name ""Ukraine's Sky Shield"" during the next Rammstein Summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.

>Independently, Australia may also supply Ukraine with its own fighter jets.

>The Australian Financial Review reported on June 6 that Canberra is considering sending 41 of its F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets, which are currently intended for sale or scrapyard.

A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir. As the reactors have been shut down for many months it is estimated that this pond will be sufficient to provide water for cooling for some months. The Agency will confirm this very shortly.  
It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity.

Crimea gets its water because of this dam. So now it gets no water.

How will Russia supply Crimea?

There are two methods available to them.

1. Through the physical bridge connecting Crimea to Russia
2. Through the land bridge connecting Ukraine to Crimea

If Ukraine cuts off the land bridge in this counter offensive, that leaves only option 1.

Ukraine can easily destroy the bridge, meaning not only will Crimea be isolated, but it won't even have water being supplied to it.

So, yes, left in control of enough of Ukraine, for long enough, he will eventually order Russians in control of the Zaporizhzhia plant to arrange a meltdown.

At this point, NATO should be doing two things:

Sending Ukraine every conventional weapon system they ask, for, with no more naive hand-wringing over how Russia will react to this or that ""provocation"" and no more foolish talk of restrictions on where and how the Ukrainians may employ them to remove Russian war criminals from their sovereign territory.

Preparing for a military intervention by the alliance that is a foregone conclusion unless the race is won to sufficiently arm the Ukrainian military to directly, with its own armed forces, bring about the encirclement and collapse of the invading Russian army before the next step in the Kremlin's plan to force an armed conflict with NATO is put into motion.

While I'd rather see Ukrainians win this outright on their own, than give Putin what he wants with a NATO air campaign and likely boots on the ground, Moscow can force the latter at any time by attacking an alliance member, so we need to be ready, on short notice, to put that plan into action.

And to satisfy ourselves that not even the Kremlin, in its conspiracy to bring this about, is prepared for just how *devastating* it will be to their armed forces. Who should be worked over, highway of death style, by artillery and tactical and strategic airpower, and harried by gunships, helicopters, and drones, the entire length of their retreat back to Russia.

Translation:

I'm afraid that they might have the audacity to drop a nuclear bomb on their own territory. Is that why we are retreating in the Belgorod region, giving them a chance to move forward, out of fear of dropping the bomb in someone else's place and showing what kind of mentally ill people we are if we drop it on our own? 

Maybe the Ukrainian Army will be standing in some village while we are there with tactical nuclear weapons.

There is a section of bridge, previously damaged by UA strikes, that clearly went missing between May 28 and June 5. In previous pics (that weren't zoomed in hi-res), it looked possible that Russia had used explosives to drop that section of bridge, probably to stop UA from using it.

However, if you take a look at the last pic in this series, you can see that one end of break is twisted and bent downwards, not a clean break like you usually see if it was deliberately mined and blown. 

Also, the support piers under that section are gone, too.

There's a *lot* of water coming either through that gate or over the top of the dam at that same spot (it was like that on May 28, too). 

Y'all take a look and see what you think about what it shows. *Something* happened there.

On the flip side, it's entirely possible that Ukraine has been told flat out that these aircraft don't have much usable life in them. And Ukraine has said that they can use the things for a few months as weapon launching platforms, they don't need thorough training for that. Just need more frames in the air in the short term. The front lines are so SAM heavy that nobody can really use aircraft there, while being able to launch more missiles from behind the lines could be really useful.",False,1686039119.0,t3_1422z48,t1_jn38gqc,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Putin and his close allies rely on an authoritarian system with deeply entrenched corruption to stay in power. Every time Ukraine becomes more democratic or fights back on corruption or even just increases their living standards this is a threat to Putin’s grip on power especially given that so many Ukrainians speak Russian and the Kremlin doesn’t want a bunch of prosperous, European oriented Russian speakers next to them who have successfully proven that autocracy and oligarchs can be defeated. For Putin and his inner circle the “best” option is to completely occupy and purge Ukraine of anyone who could threaten that grip on power. If that is impossible the “second best” option is to inflect as much damage on Ukraine as possible so that the average Ukrainian life is worse than the average Russian life so that, by comparison, Putin and his regime look better.

Russia's economy is based mostly on fossil fuels, and nuclear power is an alternative.  Less nuclear power in the world means higher prices for fossil fuels.

(The same could be said for hydroelectric for that matter, but the dam in Nova Karkhova will be rebuilt eventually.  ZNPP might not be.  Also, the dam produces about 1.4 terawatt hours anually, whereas ZNPP is more like 38 terawatt hours, according to wikipedia.  So, the impact of destroying the dam on energy markets was probably not much of a factor.)

Hopefully Russia either opts not to destroy the nuclear power plant, or they're forced to leave so abruptly that they don't have time to carry out any such plans.

The fact that Russia destroyed the dam (assuming it was them, which I don't doubt but it *is* an assumption) implies that they expect to lose control over that part of Ukraine soon.  Otherwise why would they cut off water to Crimea?  Which means they probably expect to lose control of ZNPP as well.

2. (Less important) To eliminate any chance of ZSU forcing Dnipro in this area - very unlikely, but not a zero chance if the opportunity presents itself.

To sum it up - The US, and Europe, have been getting rid of a lot of equipment they're never going to use in a war anyway by donating Bradley's and M113's. While they have a value - It costs those governments virtually nothing to be rid of them and may even provide maintenance savings. 

F-16s are a departure from this, they're actually still *in use* in the US, and as such will actually cost the US to donate. Now, they will likely start by giving away their most obsolete models pretty soon, as the F-16 was introduced 44 years ago, and some may be getting a little old, but don't expect to see the latest models gracing the skies of Ukraine, and certainly not F-35s.

I'd imagine you would wait for the reservoir to drain and flooding to subside, then add some kind of large culvert to divert the river flow while you do construction.

Then you fill the gaping hole in the dam, either as an earth-berm if it doesn't need to be very high or strong, or you pour actual concrete.  Once that's done, you plug the culvert and allow the reservoir to re-fill.

What I wonder about is if there's any way to block river flow entirely for awhile, to make it possible for Ukraine to cross the Dnipro in force with heavy vehicles?  Probably not, at least not without some quick and easy way to turn a bog into a usable road.  (Pontoon bridges, maybe?)  And maybe that part of the river is so close to sea level already that it can't drain.  At any rate, it would have been easier to do if Ukraine could have captured the dam intact, but that is no longer an option.

There *is* another dam in Dnipro, so I suppose it might be possible to wait for the flooding to subside, then block the river flow there and take advantage of low river levels to do an amphibious crossing somewhere upstream of Nova Kakhova.

I'm probably over-thinking this.

FOD can damage the engine and for the F16 it is a more common problem than with some other airframes.

However.... downcheck doesn't mean it just blows up and cant do the mission. These are combat aircraft. They are built with the assumption of some damage being possible.

The F16 is far tougher than some people are making it look like.

In peacetime no armed forces is going to tolerate losing a fighter jet due to poor maintenance or runway safety- like if they lost one jet that way in a year of peacetime flying it would be a disaster and someone would lose their job over it. Similarly, in peacetime fighter pilots are exhaustively trained to deal with every conceivable situation they might encounter because again, noone wants avoidable losses in peacetime.

In a wartime situation where Ukraine is suffering civilian and military deaths every day, and  where sufficient planes not being in the air at short notice to intercept or deter enemy attacks costs lives, the equation is very different. Not intercepting missiles kills people, and sending up pilots to fly missions in outnumbered, outgunned MiGs kills people.

If they are getting a good supply of F16s, Ukraine would probably happily accept a few avoidable fighter jet losses each year due to poor maintenance if it meant they got 20-30 extra jets regularly in the sky during that time. Losses due to less than ideal maintenance and training need to be weighed up against the lives and property saved by that extra air cover.

I think a lot of the western miscalculations about what can and can't be provided to Ukraine, what value it will have and how long it will take to be in service are due to them failing to appreciate that distinction between what is normal in peacetime or a low intensity conflict and what is acceptable in a genuine existential battle for survival.

It's not all that unusual for countries to send intelligence workers to work out of their Embassy. Makes sense when you think about it. They're the ones who are writing briefs for diplomats, or interpreting speeches anyway. Bread and butter work that's easier to do locally and in the same time zone than from a desk in Moscow. The conceit there is that the foreign agents need to be there under official cover to have diplomatic if they are caught participating in illegal espionage.  

E.g. the FSB sends an agent to their Finnish embassy to pose as a translator, but in reality they are there to solicit informants to steal state secrets. They have an embassy ID badge and everything, and if those activities are discovered the host country they can be declared persona non-grata and expelled, and the host country will lodge their protest. 

*Every* country does this, so these spies are often already known to and under surveillance by the host. This makes ""uncovering"" and PNG-ing a spy, and summoning the ambassador to express outrage/indignation, is political theatrics.

Separate from that, there are spies under non-official cover. They are sent to the host country *without* any official connection to an embassy/consulate or other organ of the state. If they are caught, they don't have diplomatic protection, and the country likely won't even acknowledge them as their agent. These spies don't get expelled. They get thrown in a hole or executed unless there's a prisoner exchange negotiated at the highest levels of government every few years.

So when an article reports that 9 spies have been discovered and are being expelled, this means that they are very likely agents who were already known to the Finnish government. And they are being expelled as a political salvo against Russia (which will be reciprocated) rather than an uncovering and dismantling of some dangerous clandestine spy network.",False,1686067524.0,t3_1422z48,t1_jn4jqkz,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Nikita Khrushchev offered the same opinion.

""If the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war,"" he wrote in his memoirs. ""One-on-one against Hitler's Germany, we would not have withstood its onslaught and would have lost the war.

No, but there is a technical argument that the seat vacated by the USSR was never officially granted to Russia, nor was Russia ever officially admitted to the UN as a whole. There was a proposal circulated for Russia to take the USSR's place which no one objected to at the time, but no official vote was ever held (AFAIK). No one makes a big deal out of it because Russia would almost certainly get the spot anyway as those spots were all intended for the major nuclear armed powers.

Apparently, *according to the discord docs*, Ukraine had some kind of plan to attack the pipeline.

""NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the UN Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia, who indicated that they would veto such a measure. As a result, NATO launched its campaign without the UN's approval, stating that it was a humanitarian intervention. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack – neither of which were present in this case.

The bombing was NATO's second major combat operation, following the 1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was the first time that NATO had used military force without the expressed endorsement of the UN Security Council and thus, international legal approval, which triggered debates over the legitimacy of the intervention.""",False,1686045637.0,t3_1422z48,t1_jn3loqd,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

>This is a real game-changer.  A Naval Strike Missile (small warhead) or a Maritime Tomahawk costs each over 2 million dollars.  This is a JDAM converted for maritime use which costs around 30 thousand dollars.  The QuickSink version is built to hit the center of the ship below water, and then its 2000 lb. + warhead literally cuts the ship in half by lifting it up and breaking its back, causing it to quickly sink.  Only the Mark 48 torpedo can be as effective, and its cost ranges from 1 million to 3.5 million for the ADCAP version.

>So to present a real example: One four-ship flight of F-35's could stealthily carry two QuickSink bombs each, and release them over 10 miles away from the target--fire and forget--and these GPS guided smart-bombs could sink 8 ships for a total weapons cost of 240 thousand dollars.

>To put this into perspective, the US Navy very often has a SinkEx exercise where various ships have live fire target practice on an old decommissioned ship.  Using Naval Strike Missiles, Harpoons, Tomahawks, and even 5"" guns only damage the ships, but the target ships stubbornly do not sink even after many hits.  Usually the sinking occurs after a submarine finally shoots the target with a Mark 48 heavy torpedo.

That additional cooling pond is the only water, you can’t cool the spent fuel pool of this thing with a garden hose, or even a firehose. In fact without the cooling pond you can’t even run the diesel generators to keep the cooling system running, as these generators are cooled by… water from the cooling pond.

It’s good that we’ve never seen the power go out to the ZNPP before in this conflict…

There is a clock on this, that reservoir will last months at the current rate of usage which is still to be verified.

Stop trying to prove that you’re right when you’re wrong. This destruction of the dam is indeed an attempt at a nuclear emergency. This emergency is important as spent fuel is not kept inside the same containment vessel that the active reactor is in. If it starts to burn it is a very very bad day. This bad day needs to be prevented. The easiest way to prevent this is to proclaim the znpp an international emergency and fill it up with UN peacekeepers armed to the absolute teeth to protect and oversee the civil infrastructure project to get more water to the place. You can’t build this overnight.

The Dems kicked ass in November 2019 and won gubernatorial races in Louisiana and Kentucky yet Trump almost won in 2020 once Covid hit and if you look at his approval there was no notable dip after Covid. The 2020 election was also conducted largely before the vaccine was available so even if GOP voters showed more hesitancy to get the vaccine it wouldn’t have disproportionately effected the GOP in November 2020.

That's why the UN was created, forged out of the structural failures of the League of Nations which failed to prevent WWII.  And thanks to the sacrosanct vetos of the five powers the UN performs this job astonishingly well (at the cost of some minor local wars due to occasional temper tantrums of the five powers).  You're proposing to change that.

Russia's veto (and possibly China's veto) prevented the security council from authorizing a military intervention to stop the invasion.  Direct combat between NATO and RU forces could easily lead to a global nuclear war and is not in the interest of the human race at this time.  That might change if Russia goes nuclear in Ukraine despite the lack of direct intervention by foreign forces.

It's extremely unlikely that significant change will come to the security council unless it stops working (=preventing a world war) or is widely felt to be losing its ability to work.  The current structure of the security council helped humanity navigate the dark terror of the hair-trigger alert cold war, which was essentially a nuclear standoff with 70 000 nuclear warheads.  Today we know that it worked, but it's easy to forget that at the time many where paralyzed with fear or furious with anger and doubted humanity would make it.  

Potential situations to trigger a change in security council structure might be things like Russia going nuclear in Ukraine, or a non-veto power (such as India) growing so powerful that denying it the veto would be more dangerous than granting it.",1686088120.0,1686087413.0,t3_1422z48,t1_jn5yt75,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
