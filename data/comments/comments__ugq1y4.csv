Day 68 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It seems these past couple of counteroffensives in the recent days that liberated some settlements around Kharkiv have made a real difference. Shelling around my area is now much less frequent, though it didn’t stop completely, and sometimes it still sounds very close to us, so we can’t let our guard down.

And it looks like shelling is now less frequent in pretty much all parts of our city, as today even the curfew was moved further back from 8 PM to 9 PM, meaning that it’s now a bit safer in Kharkiv. We are still told to stay at home and only go outside if necessary, but that doesn’t stop people from going for a walk.

I still don’t understand why Russia is trying to make everyone hate them, what is their end goal? It’s like they are deliberately saying the worst stuff to piss everyone off, but why? Like what did they gain from saying that Jews are the biggest antisemites and claiming that Hitler was a Jew? Their actions just make no sense at all.

In their May 9th posters they now also started to write “Victory 1945-2022”, basically saying that they defeated Nazis again this year. This Nazi and USSR bullshit is getting old already, why can’t they just let go of the past and finally start living in the present?

*- Is Russia planning to announce mobilization on May 9?- Yes, they are preparing. Now the Rosreserve has begun to check what they actually have in stock, and calculate that they can give out on mobilization orders. This is an absolutely necessary step before the start of real mobilization.*

*- What is the Kremlin's plan for May 9? Victory in Donbass?- This is their goal, but it will not be, they do not have time. In no way do they have time.*

*- What is the mood in the Russian army among those who are at war? Our military says that the Russians do not even take the bodies of their victims from the battlefield. The Russian military sees that they have huge losses. Russian propaganda keeps silent about all this, but should the army know about it?- It comes, of course. The Russian army is completely demotivated. However, there is a military vertical - commands come to them, and they will be forced to carry them out. Whether you like it or not, there is an order, and you will carry it out. If you don't do it, you go to jail, there are many different options. Therefore, their moral condition is not significant. They will carry out the order.*

*- Which?*

*- The first is the division of Russia into three or more parts. And the second - the relative preservation of the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation when changing the country's leadership. In the latter case, the new leader will say that Russia has nothing to do with all these processes, it was a sick dictator, and the country is useless. In this case, Russia will give up all its occupied territories - from the islands of Japan to Königsberg \[present-day Kaliningrad\], which belongs to Germany.*",1651517626.0,1651517040.0,t3_ugq1y4,t3_ugq1y4,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

The action ""They didn't fight for this"". 
May 9 - in the rally of the ""Immortal Field”

On May 9, Putin's main propaganda event will take place - military parades all over the country. Along with them, the ""Immortal Field"" marches will also take place, commemorating those who died during the Great Patriotic War (1941-45).

""Immortal Field"" is primarily intended to recall the sacrifices, grief and suffering that war brings with it. 

We are sure that our grandparents sacrificed themselves and prayed the such war would never happen again.

Putin betrayed their memory, their hopes and their sacrifice. By appropriating the victory in the Great Patriotic War, Putin turned the date of May 9 into a holiday of militarism and xenophobia under the slogan ""we can do it again”.

Today our duty is to demand peace. This is the only way to truly honor the victims of World War II and Great Patriotic War. 
That is why we are announcing the action 

""They didn't fight for this"".

We ask you to come out to the rally ""Immortal Field"" in your city. This year, the marches will take place without covid restrictions.

What to do at the rally?

Express your protest against the war in Ukraine in any way you can:

1. Join the column with a photo of your relative who died in WWII, with the slogan ""he/she didn't fight for this"" on top.

2. You can think of other slogans: ""he/she did not die for a new war,"" ""he/she would never have believed that we would be at war with Ukraine,"" ""he/she dreamed of peace in the whole world,"" ""his/her causes were betrayed by Putin,"" ""Putin betrayed his/her dreams,"" ""he/she did not want to repeat it,"" and so on.
 
Or to come out with pictures of the destruction and victims of the war in Ukraine and with any anti-war slogans.

We are sure that you can think of more than one way to show your attitude to the war in Ukraine, so we leave the list of anti-war agitation at the march open.

How to prepare?

1. Look for information about where the ""Immortal Field"" march will be held in your city. This is usually reported in the regional news and on the official website.

2. Think about how to discreetly and safely hide such posters/transparencies and carry them in the columns. It is usually free to join general processions, but extra caution wouldn't hurt.

3. Make posters/transparencies in advance. Don't forget that the back of the posters/transparencies is also perfectly visible to the participants of the Immortal Field.",1651520897.0,1651518503.0,t3_ugq1y4,t3_ugq1y4,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

From CNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Stephanie Halasz in London

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to tell the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, that Ukraine is living through its “finest hour.” 

Johnson will address the parliament via video link on Tuesday, according to a Downing Street news release.  

In his speech, the prime minister will draw a parallel between the Ukrainian parliament and the British parliament which during World War II “continued to meet throughout the conflict.” 

“The British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour,"" Johnson will say, according to the news release. “This is Ukraine’s finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come.""

He will also tell Ukrainian lawmakers how Britain is “proud to be among Ukraine’s friends.” 

“Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free,” Johnson will say. 

The prime minister will also lay out Tuesday a new package of $375 million (300 million pounds) in support for Ukraine, according to Downing Street. 

The package will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter battery radar system, GPS jamming equipment and thousands of night vision devices, according to the news release. 

Johnson’s address is set to coincide with the reopening of the British embassy in Kyiv which closed in late February just before the war started. ",False,1651535483.0,t3_ugq1y4,t3_ugq1y4,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Tanks (seems very small), it could indicate that the fight was mostly ranged engagements with few Russian advances where tanks have been exposed.

My own two cents is that now is about the right time for the counter-artillery radar that NATO gave to Ukraine to come online.

And since most Russian artillery teams are trained for massed battery bombardments, not short precise fire missions... they would be sitting ducks to the accurately targeted counter battery fire that the Ukrainians would be able to achieve with those radars.

> - (F): No idea, what is Zerg rush? 

> - (A): It's a computer game, it has a nation - Zergs, insects. And since earthlings and another people have advanced technology, these just throw in masses. 

> - (F): Throwing masses. 

> - (A): So what I'm thinking - judging by the people who are right now reinforcing infantry units of the Russian army, they are not specialists, not artillerists, not tankmen. They are recruiting lumpens, they are given some old uniform, given boots from 1951, machine gun from 1947 and a helmet from 1943, and sent into combat. Heroically sent to battle. What's the most amazing thing - (attention! Tere -- sic) is enough volunteers. 

> - (F): So they are volunteers? 

> - (A): Volunteers, yes. There are many of them. They have two
significant advantages - there are many of them, and they are
volunteers. 

> - (F): Third - car loans.

> (A): Yes, car loans. And a bunch of disadvantages, such as that they can't do anything, they do not pose a combat power, only representing live power, but it's not for long either. 30% of those who entered Ukraine in two weeks, vnly 30% are still alive. A part ran away, a part was destroyed. In my estimation, I think that by the mid May they can recruit 10,000 people. And they will heroically go somewhere, the question is - where? And this will look similar to invasion by Chinese volunteers in the Korean war....

I don't see it that way. I think there would for sure be a power struggle if Putin died from a bullet. But that might be avoided if Putin knew he were dying from one of the many rumored diseases and arranged for a successor.

And the successor would now have a tailor made way out of the mess that Putin created - just throw Putin under the bus, say he went insane, say it was all him, but now is a new dawn. I think this is the most likely path of a new leader, because anybody taking over is unlikely to be as deluded about Russia's position as Putin might be - they'll have more and better information, unfiltered by sycophants, and know that they have to withdraw from Ukraine and get the sanctions lifted if Russia is to survive.

I think the best way to describe BONUS is that it is a 155mm gun. No, I mean the shell is a gun, two guns.

You shoot two guns into the air, and then the guns look for a tank, and then the guns shoot the tank.

That's right, the M777 gun loads a BONUS round (containing 2 guns), the 2-guns are fired into the enemy-territory. The guns have anti-tank guidance. The two guns inside of the BONUS round scan the area, looking for tanks, and once they see a tank, they then shoot the tanks.

EDIT: Maybe not tanks. 100mm RHA penetration is very small. Still, that's enough to kill lighter-armor like APCs, IFVs.

The problem with Chomsky’s argument is that he’s defining “provocation” subjectively from the standpoint of Russia/Ukraine and objectively from the standpoint of US/Iraq. 

The fact is that not only (as Chomsky admits) is the “provocation” not justification for violence, it was just as bullshit a reason in general as the US justification for the Iraq War. 

It’s like saying a woman not dressing conservatively “provoked” a sexual assault.   No. No she did not.  A provocation by its nature must be a reasonable justification for the response. Otherwise it’s just a fucking excuse for doing what you WANT to do. 

Further, the focus on NATO as the core cause is bullshit. The core issue was Ukraine’s slow shift from the Russian to the European orbit starting with the refusal of Ukraine to ratify the CIS in the 1990s, with Russia gradually increasing their rhetoric and violence each time Ukraine failed to fall in line rather than attempting to court Ukraine back to their orbit. 

This war was inevitable because Ukraine refused to stay under the Kremlin’s thumb like Belarus has, refused to elect pro-Russian governments, refused to accept Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory, and was gradually aligning itself with Eastern Europe.

This had recieved tens of millions in funding and it was promoted as state of the art, producing homegrown heart rate monitors and respirators. I was there mostly from a business partnership perspective - they wanted to show off their new capabilities to foreign companies. 

I was taken by limo and tour guide to a beautiful new building northwest of the city. There were layers of security and access controls. Paperwork and stamps. They didn't know it, but I actually had a background in the manufacture and assembly of printed circuit boards (PCBs), so I was very interested in what new tech they had set up, hidden behind the shiny walls and security guards. 

Once inside, this is what I saw:

1. Only about 1/4 of the space was used. Lots of empty rooms hidden behind closed doors (we asked and they showed).
2. They equipment was all second hand (or 3rd hand, etc). It has been a decade since I worked in the PCB space, and everything I saw there would have been considered old and nearly outdated back then. 
3. When all was said and done, they had a 90% failure rate. They proudly stated things like ""at this stage, 80% percent make it through."" But when you added it all up, 90% failed by the end. Modern PCB printing at that scale is usually >99% successful, if not more.  
4. The staff were either missing or dispondent, mostly playing solitaire and minesweeper on their computers as we toured. Workstations we're chaotic. Piles of failed circuit boards stacked everywhere, with a few teams assigned to fix them by hand, but mostly they were enjoying solitaire too. Even basic things were missing, like using anti-static protections. It was a mess. But the security was good. 
5. They had no sense of what ""good"" looked like. No shame in anything that we saw and no realization that what they were saying was awful. They talked as if this was the best thing that ever existed, with no apparent knowledge of everything else that existed. 

The short version is basically Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

If their state of the art medical manufacturing was in such a terrible state, I can only imagine their weapons production is similar. Rapidly ramping up production in an explosives factory with similar quality and safety issues?

* Siberian forest
* Oil depots
* Storage depots
* Chemical plant
* Research institute
* College of Aerospace Engineering
* Two malls
* Airfield
* Power plant
* Moskva flagship
* Explosion and burning of at least seven cars in Moscow
* Explosives factory
* Fuel trucks
* Large warehouse
* Hydroelectric complex collapse
* Military recruitment centers
* Railway bridge and embankment 
* Moscow governor’s mansion
* Medical center
* Police stations
* Meat processing plant
* Mining plant
