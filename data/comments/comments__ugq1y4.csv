Day 68 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It seems these past couple of counteroffensives in the recent days that liberated some settlements around Kharkiv have made a real difference. Shelling around my area is now much less frequent, though it didn’t stop completely, and sometimes it still sounds very close to us, so we can’t let our guard down.

And it looks like shelling is now less frequent in pretty much all parts of our city, as today even the curfew was moved further back from 8 PM to 9 PM, meaning that it’s now a bit safer in Kharkiv. We are still told to stay at home and only go outside if necessary, but that doesn’t stop people from going for a walk.

I still don’t understand why Russia is trying to make everyone hate them, what is their end goal? It’s like they are deliberately saying the worst stuff to piss everyone off, but why? Like what did they gain from saying that Jews are the biggest antisemites and claiming that Hitler was a Jew? Their actions just make no sense at all.

In their May 9th posters they now also started to write “Victory 1945-2022”, basically saying that they defeated Nazis again this year. This Nazi and USSR bullshit is getting old already, why can’t they just let go of the past and finally start living in the present?

*- Is Russia planning to announce mobilization on May 9?- Yes, they are preparing. Now the Rosreserve has begun to check what they actually have in stock, and calculate that they can give out on mobilization orders. This is an absolutely necessary step before the start of real mobilization.*

*- What is the Kremlin's plan for May 9? Victory in Donbass?- This is their goal, but it will not be, they do not have time. In no way do they have time.*

*- What is the mood in the Russian army among those who are at war? Our military says that the Russians do not even take the bodies of their victims from the battlefield. The Russian military sees that they have huge losses. Russian propaganda keeps silent about all this, but should the army know about it?- It comes, of course. The Russian army is completely demotivated. However, there is a military vertical - commands come to them, and they will be forced to carry them out. Whether you like it or not, there is an order, and you will carry it out. If you don't do it, you go to jail, there are many different options. Therefore, their moral condition is not significant. They will carry out the order.*

*- Which?*

*- The first is the division of Russia into three or more parts. And the second - the relative preservation of the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation when changing the country's leadership. In the latter case, the new leader will say that Russia has nothing to do with all these processes, it was a sick dictator, and the country is useless. In this case, Russia will give up all its occupied territories - from the islands of Japan to Königsberg \[present-day Kaliningrad\], which belongs to Germany.*",1651517626.0,1651517040.0,t3_ugq1y4,t3_ugq1y4,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

The action ""They didn't fight for this"". 
May 9 - in the rally of the ""Immortal Field”

On May 9, Putin's main propaganda event will take place - military parades all over the country. Along with them, the ""Immortal Field"" marches will also take place, commemorating those who died during the Great Patriotic War (1941-45).

""Immortal Field"" is primarily intended to recall the sacrifices, grief and suffering that war brings with it. 

We are sure that our grandparents sacrificed themselves and prayed the such war would never happen again.

Putin betrayed their memory, their hopes and their sacrifice. By appropriating the victory in the Great Patriotic War, Putin turned the date of May 9 into a holiday of militarism and xenophobia under the slogan ""we can do it again”.

Today our duty is to demand peace. This is the only way to truly honor the victims of World War II and Great Patriotic War. 
That is why we are announcing the action 

""They didn't fight for this"".

We ask you to come out to the rally ""Immortal Field"" in your city. This year, the marches will take place without covid restrictions.

What to do at the rally?

Express your protest against the war in Ukraine in any way you can:

1. Join the column with a photo of your relative who died in WWII, with the slogan ""he/she didn't fight for this"" on top.

2. You can think of other slogans: ""he/she did not die for a new war,"" ""he/she would never have believed that we would be at war with Ukraine,"" ""he/she dreamed of peace in the whole world,"" ""his/her causes were betrayed by Putin,"" ""Putin betrayed his/her dreams,"" ""he/she did not want to repeat it,"" and so on.
 
Or to come out with pictures of the destruction and victims of the war in Ukraine and with any anti-war slogans.

We are sure that you can think of more than one way to show your attitude to the war in Ukraine, so we leave the list of anti-war agitation at the march open.

How to prepare?

1. Look for information about where the ""Immortal Field"" march will be held in your city. This is usually reported in the regional news and on the official website.

2. Think about how to discreetly and safely hide such posters/transparencies and carry them in the columns. It is usually free to join general processions, but extra caution wouldn't hurt.

3. Make posters/transparencies in advance. Don't forget that the back of the posters/transparencies is also perfectly visible to the participants of the Immortal Field.",1651520897.0,1651518503.0,t3_ugq1y4,t3_ugq1y4,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

From CNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Stephanie Halasz in London

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to tell the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, that Ukraine is living through its “finest hour.” 

Johnson will address the parliament via video link on Tuesday, according to a Downing Street news release.  

In his speech, the prime minister will draw a parallel between the Ukrainian parliament and the British parliament which during World War II “continued to meet throughout the conflict.” 

“The British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour,"" Johnson will say, according to the news release. “This is Ukraine’s finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come.""

He will also tell Ukrainian lawmakers how Britain is “proud to be among Ukraine’s friends.” 

“Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free,” Johnson will say. 

The prime minister will also lay out Tuesday a new package of $375 million (300 million pounds) in support for Ukraine, according to Downing Street. 

The package will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter battery radar system, GPS jamming equipment and thousands of night vision devices, according to the news release. 

Johnson’s address is set to coincide with the reopening of the British embassy in Kyiv which closed in late February just before the war started. ",False,1651535483.0,t3_ugq1y4,t3_ugq1y4,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

Tanks (seems very small), it could indicate that the fight was mostly ranged engagements with few Russian advances where tanks have been exposed.

My own two cents is that now is about the right time for the counter-artillery radar that NATO gave to Ukraine to come online.

And since most Russian artillery teams are trained for massed battery bombardments, not short precise fire missions... they would be sitting ducks to the accurately targeted counter battery fire that the Ukrainians would be able to achieve with those radars.

> - (F): No idea, what is Zerg rush? 

> - (A): It's a computer game, it has a nation - Zergs, insects. And since earthlings and another people have advanced technology, these just throw in masses. 

> - (F): Throwing masses. 

> - (A): So what I'm thinking - judging by the people who are right now reinforcing infantry units of the Russian army, they are not specialists, not artillerists, not tankmen. They are recruiting lumpens, they are given some old uniform, given boots from 1951, machine gun from 1947 and a helmet from 1943, and sent into combat. Heroically sent to battle. What's the most amazing thing - (attention! Tere -- sic) is enough volunteers. 

> - (F): So they are volunteers? 

> - (A): Volunteers, yes. There are many of them. They have two
significant advantages - there are many of them, and they are
volunteers. 

> - (F): Third - car loans.

> (A): Yes, car loans. And a bunch of disadvantages, such as that they can't do anything, they do not pose a combat power, only representing live power, but it's not for long either. 30% of those who entered Ukraine in two weeks, vnly 30% are still alive. A part ran away, a part was destroyed. In my estimation, I think that by the mid May they can recruit 10,000 people. And they will heroically go somewhere, the question is - where? And this will look similar to invasion by Chinese volunteers in the Korean war....

I don't see it that way. I think there would for sure be a power struggle if Putin died from a bullet. But that might be avoided if Putin knew he were dying from one of the many rumored diseases and arranged for a successor.

And the successor would now have a tailor made way out of the mess that Putin created - just throw Putin under the bus, say he went insane, say it was all him, but now is a new dawn. I think this is the most likely path of a new leader, because anybody taking over is unlikely to be as deluded about Russia's position as Putin might be - they'll have more and better information, unfiltered by sycophants, and know that they have to withdraw from Ukraine and get the sanctions lifted if Russia is to survive.

I think the best way to describe BONUS is that it is a 155mm gun. No, I mean the shell is a gun, two guns.

You shoot two guns into the air, and then the guns look for a tank, and then the guns shoot the tank.

That's right, the M777 gun loads a BONUS round (containing 2 guns), the 2-guns are fired into the enemy-territory. The guns have anti-tank guidance. The two guns inside of the BONUS round scan the area, looking for tanks, and once they see a tank, they then shoot the tanks.

EDIT: Maybe not tanks. 100mm RHA penetration is very small. Still, that's enough to kill lighter-armor like APCs, IFVs.

The problem with Chomsky’s argument is that he’s defining “provocation” subjectively from the standpoint of Russia/Ukraine and objectively from the standpoint of US/Iraq. 

The fact is that not only (as Chomsky admits) is the “provocation” not justification for violence, it was just as bullshit a reason in general as the US justification for the Iraq War. 

It’s like saying a woman not dressing conservatively “provoked” a sexual assault.   No. No she did not.  A provocation by its nature must be a reasonable justification for the response. Otherwise it’s just a fucking excuse for doing what you WANT to do. 

Further, the focus on NATO as the core cause is bullshit. The core issue was Ukraine’s slow shift from the Russian to the European orbit starting with the refusal of Ukraine to ratify the CIS in the 1990s, with Russia gradually increasing their rhetoric and violence each time Ukraine failed to fall in line rather than attempting to court Ukraine back to their orbit. 

This war was inevitable because Ukraine refused to stay under the Kremlin’s thumb like Belarus has, refused to elect pro-Russian governments, refused to accept Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory, and was gradually aligning itself with Eastern Europe.

Yeah, I know. You can argue that there were other wars and conflicts that match this pattern but like WW I was a mix of 19th century war and 20th century war (and the Russo-Japanese War was an echo of things to come) this war seems to mark a similar change. 

We have a LOT more open source info and disinformation. Events can be streamed by anyone in near real time. No filter. You aren’t waiting for a broadcast from a news channel or a report from the local paper. 

Information (and disinformation) can be published out globally by anyone. We are all watching telegram and Twitter for information updates which is great from a real time prospective (usually Twitter beats the news channels by an hour or so) but also has no vetting (do you really trust the source?). Sources can be deceiving - I seem to recall an article on Twitter news bots publishing local news truthfully for years so folks would follow them and then they slip in propaganda. 

Technology has made it possible to use off the shelf parts to build drones and tech that a couple decades ago was classified and proprietary. This has opened up new tactics to undermine the old tactics of war. Wanna get real time video of the situation? Don’t send up a million dollar drone, throw a cheap one up, get a real time view, and by the way tag the geo location to feed it into precision weapons if it is important enough to use them. 

Take out a $700k weapon with a $20k one.

After that, the Ukrainians will effectively be a modern army with superior artillery and AA capabilities in Ukraine, and Russia won't have a chance. In my view they have one month to do any of the following:

1. Full mobilization with increased chemical weapons usage on civilian targets. Potentially including Polish airfields where US weapons are being delivered. Yes I know this would be a NATO target, but it's a logical thing to do if you're desperate and facing an existential crisis to your regime and country's identity. In the worst case, tactical nukes might be used on entrenched Ukrainian positions or cities to try to force a surrender.

2. Regime change. The Kremlin has been relatively quiet these past few days. Rumors that Putin is unwell, about to undergo surgery, Parkinson, etc. are increasing. If Moscow is quiet, it historically means turmoil.

3. Negotiations. If there was ever a time to come to the negotiating table, it would be now. The problem is Russia never negotiates from a position of weakness. I see this as the least likely without #2 happening. This also seems unlikely on the Ukrainian side, because I think the majority of th now (rightly so) believe they can win.

Without the above Russia is facing insurmountable losses. They will be facing an army that is essentially equipped as the US military. This next month is going to be a very dangerous time. We're going to see Putin at his most desperate.

Sure, I assume this would allow Putin to call up reserves, allow broader conscription of citizens, and likely evoke a wartime power over dissent and further economic moves. 

But if it’s only declared against Ukraine, what does that, a formal declaration, mean for the West whose supplying of military, logistical and intelligence has been everything to Ukraine’s fight? Russia has long now declared who is and who is not a “hostile country” to them; they’ve said that a NATO supply is open game. Would declaring war then be an opening for Russia, theoretically, to engage the West, as they are the main supplier of Ukraine’s fight right now?

This had recieved tens of millions in funding and it was promoted as state of the art, producing homegrown heart rate monitors and respirators. I was there mostly from a business partnership perspective - they wanted to show off their new capabilities to foreign companies. 

I was taken by limo and tour guide to a beautiful new building northwest of the city. There were layers of security and access controls. Paperwork and stamps. They didn't know it, but I actually had a background in the manufacture and assembly of printed circuit boards (PCBs), so I was very interested in what new tech they had set up, hidden behind the shiny walls and security guards. 

Once inside, this is what I saw:

1. Only about 1/4 of the space was used. Lots of empty rooms hidden behind closed doors (we asked and they showed).
2. They equipment was all second hand (or 3rd hand, etc). It has been a decade since I worked in the PCB space, and everything I saw there would have been considered old and nearly outdated back then. 
3. When all was said and done, they had a 90% failure rate. They proudly stated things like ""at this stage, 80% percent make it through."" But when you added it all up, 90% failed by the end. Modern PCB printing at that scale is usually >99% successful, if not more.  
4. The staff were either missing or dispondent, mostly playing solitaire and minesweeper on their computers as we toured. Workstations we're chaotic. Piles of failed circuit boards stacked everywhere, with a few teams assigned to fix them by hand, but mostly they were enjoying solitaire too. Even basic things were missing, like using anti-static protections. It was a mess. But the security was good. 
5. They had no sense of what ""good"" looked like. No shame in anything that we saw and no realization that what they were saying was awful. They talked as if this was the best thing that ever existed, with no apparent knowledge of everything else that existed. 

The short version is basically Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

If their state of the art medical manufacturing was in such a terrible state, I can only imagine their weapons production is similar. Rapidly ramping up production in an explosives factory with similar quality and safety issues?

Once they get them, the war is going to shift into a more deadlock of defensive skirmishes for a month or two. After that, a lot of the weapons they've been given will unfortunately start to be discarded and useless. 

I've seen many military analysts allude to this now. The weapons to Ukraine are not the saving grace/force that the media is actually hyping up for two main reasons. Training and maintenance. 

You're only going to have a limited supply of people trained on these vehicles and that training is actually a costly endeavor because of reason #2. 

Ukraine can't repair or maintain these new weapons in any meaningful capacity. Once something breaks you won't have the parts needed and the weapons or vehicles will be discarded. This means training your entire army on these things is a waste because they have a finite shelf life.

Furthermore, Russian dumb gun-artillery out-ranges USA's dumb gun artillery (that's why the M982 Excalibur was invented, to increase the accuracy at long range, extending the effective-range of the system).

The M777 will help Ukraine battle on even-grounds against the Russians. But I'm not sure if its actually ""superiority"" yet.

But all you see around you is property that your forces is relentlessly destroying.  The people you see are terrified ordinary women, children and old men.  Who spit venom in fluent Russian.   And the men you don't see have killed and wounded most of your buddies.

Finally you are ordered back to Russia.  You breath a sigh of relief to be out of this hellhole.   

And then are ordered to report into a new unit. Trying to fit in, you  swap stories with your new comrades, trying to make sense of things... and when your new captain brings new orders to mount up and go back in with fresh supplies, you can't help but remember with a mixture of dread and resignation what happened last time...

Ukraine didn't provoke Russia into invading, and Russia has no justification for invading. The problem I have is the word ""provoke."" The better world here is *precipitated*. There were several steps in the long chain that led to this war, and the US publicly pushing Ukraine to leave Russia's orbit and trying to join NATO was one of those steps.

To borrow your analogy of the girl who dresses in a revealing manner: she didn't provoke her attacker. You're a 3rd party bystander who knew that there was a sexual predator around. He had made comments about the girl previously, and you knew that this predator was on a hair-trigger for attacking the woman.

Do you bear *any* responsibility for publicly buying and having the woman wear even more revealing clothes? Do you bear *any* responsibility for ignoring the environment around you while pouring gasoline onto a situation that might result in a conflagration?

It's easy to cast blame off on Russia for their actions- Don't mistake my position here: Putin and his cronies rightly bear the responsibility for invading, and the US should do all it can to allow Ukraine to defend itself and push the Russians out.

However, I feel like the US was reckless in its handling of Ukraine before the war and that recklessness precipitated the Russian invasion. Public declarations that Ukraine was going to join NATO- while knowing full well that it would result in Russia taking actions like invading to prevent it- was a mistake on the part of the United States. I blame the US government for precipitating the deteriorating diplomatic situation in 2021, and I blame the US for not taking steps to better prepare Ukraine beforehand. The time to have sent in heavy weapons was in 2021, not two months after the invasion.

* Siberian forest
* Oil depots
* Storage depots

* College of Aerospace Engineering
* Two malls
* Airfield
* Power plant
* Moskva flagship
* Explosion and burning of at least seven cars in Moscow
* Explosives factory
* Fuel trucks
* Large warehouse

* Military recruitment centers
* Railway bridge and embankment

Ukraine has a lot more units in the east, but that's also where the bulk of the Russian troops are.

Barring a collapse by Russian forces, any sort of major offensive by the Ukrainians is unlikely in the short term - they're going to be focusing on executing their defense-in-depth/mobile defense strategy to blunt the Russians attacks in the east and bleed the Russians dry.

So, if the question is where will Russia focus longer term as they are forced to choose, I would say they will likely focus on southern Donbass and Kherson, because they want the coast and the land bridge. However, if they are truly beaten and think they have a better chance of holding sections of Donbass by giving up Kherson / the coastal bridge, that is what they will be forced to attempt.

Indeed.  Why are Russians doing this?  Because they have gone much, much further down this rabbit hole where ***everything*** they deem evil, don't like, find uncomfortable or mildly disagree with is labeled Nazi.  This is stupid, when they do it and when we do it.  ""Going further than Hitler"" here is making no real reference to a man that lived a few decades ago.

Russia's MO is to install a puppet regime and either have it declare independence as it's own state, or directly hold a ""referendum"" to become part of Russia. Crimea is an example of the latter. DPR and LPR (Russian puppets) are examples of the former.  They wrote their own constitutions and claimed the entirety of the Oblasts which were mostly controlled by Ukraine prior to February 24, 2022.


That's where this is an issue. Russia annexing the DPR and LPR is bad because in their constitutions, they claim the entirety of the Oblasts which is a casus belli for Russia to weaponize. They'll claim that Ukraine is now on Russian sovereign land which then becomes a reason for further escalation. If peace deal is signed along current lines of control or even Pre-Feburary 24th, that casus belli will remain unresolved and be a means to restart the war when Russia's fixed all it's military issues.


That's why this war needs to continue until Ukraine reaches terms it see's as reasonable. Which in terms of their best interest is to see any regions like the Donbas fully retaken or extremely concrete borders drawn up with detailed concessions from Russian on the nullification of LPR and DPR's recognized borders. So that no casus belli remain for this war to reignite.


They will attempt that same MO on the Kherson Oblast too before the war is over which will further complicate things unless Ukraine can reassume control over the city.

It outlines that the West is out to get their resources. Through that lens, this war is an attempt at a preemptive strike against further unfriendly expansion. Their ruling class basically don't want to become another state where US stages an intervention, some revolution overthrows them, etc.

Well that's just crazy, right? Not so much. The aforementioned book gives other reasons that are a lot more shaky, but the forecasted outcome is the same. Read on...

Thing is, the Russian ruling class is ideologically mismatched with Western governments. It's a country with intense corruption that only grows the higher up the ladder you go. The people in charge hoard power, and have zero internal incentive to share it.

While you still see some of this in capitalist societies, you don't see nearly as much. We share that power because we _like_ the rule of law. We trust our government to keep business running.

That's not the case in Russia, where the strong eat the weak. To feel safe, elements of the Russian mob demands to _be_ the law. Else the other mobsters would get them.

This is a mismatch. People who expect security and adherence to rules can't do business with those who dismiss them. This is why investment is Russia has been historically low. It's not a safe place to do business.

But this tapestry goes further, with internal pressures sure to mount as well. Given Russia's not a safe place to do business, the standard of living for the general population is also low in the country--compared to its overall wealth. Many simply don't see a better life for themselves. Coupled with not needing to develop a local economy past exporting resources, the Russian people are in a bit of a pickle with getting themselves nice things.

Creeping westernization, with its notions of personal liberties and opportunity for all, would certainly shake that. Warmer relations and the slow inflow of nice stuff would add to that, as people would see that there's better. Together, a certain catalyst for serious political competition. Eventually, a much more serious demand for free elections. Or worse.

Or back to the book's point, double worse. The ruling class know that before long the democracy police will come knocking. They've seen it time and again: when there's political unrest and resources others' voters and lobbyists would want, there were ""interventions"" and wars. Heck, some have even staged a number of these themselves back in the day. But now they're at risk of being on the other end.

So, they do what you can to stave things off. They run the secret police, control the media, and create heavy nationalist rhetoric. Do whatever they can to make sure these western ideals don't take root. Then, they look in the direction where Westernization is coming from, and try to reverse the trend however they can.

Yes, they come out the loser anyway. But they're not just going to just walk away from their billions.",False,1651505043.0,t3_ugq1y4,t1_i713wdf,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

I dont think many people are suggesting that Ukraine surrender but I do think people are starting to fear that the west helped too much and are going to be seen as the reason (by Russia) that they will take a total loss here. I think the reason more people were not concerned about this earlier is because they ssumed Russia might at least get something (like the eastern provinces) held and then just call it a win and try and defend into a stalemate. The more it looks like Russia might collapse militarily the more desperate Putin will be. 

I think the west has had the right approach here in that they either allowed Putin to take Ukraine or they risk a much more powerful Russia making similar demands down the road. The only thing I do see some credibility in is that the best way for Russia to actually lose here is slowly. Of course that is a selfish approach because I am not from Ukraine and it is not my family, friends and people being killed. 

The issue with Putin using tactical nukes within Ukraine is that it puts the world in a hostage situation where they either have to risk destroying everything to stop Putin from doing this again.

Says Russia will slow the pace because they don't have forces and could take ""years to replenish and rebuild"" while Ukraine gets supplied from the west. Yet somehow over the same time Ukraine loses half their territory. Uh, care to explain how that makes sense Mr. General? 

Then he proposes increasing deep strikes into Russia. Ukraine knows they have to be extremely careful with that, since becoming too aggressive too soon risks their image in the eyes of the world. Way too easy for Putin to false flag some ""Ukraine"" missile strikes on children's hospitals. 

Then his comments on Odesa about how it would fall in a few weeks to a month yet be ""hard"" for the Russians to take? Ya think? If that's the last piece of the puzzle for Putin in this scenario and it comes a year from now after Russia has half of Ukraine, pretty sure Odesa by that time will be armed to the teeth. And Russia ain't nuking Odesa. So yeah it'll be ""hard.""

Oh and since this is taking so long, how's Russia's finances looking a year from now? And how does that factor in to this guys scenario? What's their military might look like 12 months from now? Will they have the ability to take half the country including Odesa and control it long enough to get Ukraine to agree to terms? Dunno 'cause this dude never discussed it.

Russia conscripts its population yearly. According to their laws, those conscripts may only be used in extremely limited, non-combat roles; if, however, those soldiers 'volunteer' then they become regulars, capable of dropping into whatever unit Putin requires. 

The problem is that those 'volunteers' are often coerced. There's a lot of ways to go about it. Maybe they threaten the conscript's family, often the conscript himself, or threaten a posting in the bum-fuck middle of Siberia.

It’s a goofy take on the world, but it’s not novel. I’m sure none of the EU nations see themselves as America’s dancing monkeys and while the FVEYS nations are close, there are still big differences.

 >A chevauchée (French pronunciation: ​[ʃəvoʃe], ""promenade"" or ""horse charge"", depending on context) was a raiding method of medieval warfare for weakening the enemy, primarily by burning and pillaging enemy territory in order to reduce the productivity of a region, as opposed to siege warfare or wars of conquest. The use of the chevauchée declined at the end of the 14th century as the focus of warfare turned to sieges. It is conceptually similar to the scorched earth strategies used in modern warfare. In the Iberian peninsula, this type of raid was usually called a cabalgada (older spelling: cavalgada).

Putin sold gas extremely cheap to mobster Dmytro Firtash in Ukraine from the Russian state owned gas company Gazprom. Firtash sold that gas on to Ukraine and Europe for a huge markup. Firtash used the money to corrupt politics, buy out businesses in Ukraine, and install people in power sympathetic to Russia. Firtash also kicked money back from the sales to Putin and his Oligarchs in various ways so they could profit from the state owned Gazprom gas off the books.

Trumps later campaign manager Paul Manafort worked in Ukraine to revamp the image of Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych was a politician, crook, and Putin puppet. Manafort helped to get him elected as leader of Ukraine and Firtash provided the money for him to do so. So basically Manafort and Firtash helped install a Putin puppet leader in Ukraine with discount Russian gas proceeds. Something Manafort himself would repeat in the US years later. Yanukovych proceeded to steal about 1 billion from the people of Ukraine. So basically Russia was in full control there.

Yanukovych was ousted as leader of Ukraine during their revolution in 2014. He refused to sign agreements that would bring Ukraine closer to the West and the people had grown tired of his corruption. He fled before the Parliament could vote to impeach and replace him. Once a new president was chosen they wanted to go after corruption and much of that was in the gas industry that was funding these Russian puppet leaders and corrupt businessmen.

Biden’s son Hunter got a job at one of the major gas companies in Ukraine (Burisma) and Joe worked towards prosecuting corrupt officials there. They were going after the politicians and funding behind the corruption more or less. Biden/Obama administration could get nowhere because Firtash had bought out the judicial system including Viktor Shokin the head prosecutor of Ukraine. Biden threatened to withhold 1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless Shokin was removed as prosecutor, Ukraine of course quickly did so.

This opened the door for the corrupt politicians and business owners puppeted by Russia to be prosecuted. Firtash got arrested on an unrelated bribery charge and he wanted a stay of extradition to the US from Trump. To get it he offered Guliani manufactured dirt on the Bidens and sent two men on his payroll Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to accomplish it. Parnas and Fruman were in the states funneling dirty Russian money to Republican politicians.

They all ended up getting caught because the whole quid pro quo phone call got leaked. So the whole thing was because Firtash wanted revenge against the Bidens for dismantling his corrupt empire that let him buy out everyone in Ukraine. Guliani tried to paint it as Joe Biden got the prosecutor fired in Ukraine because Hunter was corrupt and Joe didn't want him to be investigated. In reality the prosecutor was fired because he wouldn't investigate criminals because he was bought out by Firtash and Russia.

In all likelihood the simple truth is that Russia has been riding on the shadow of the former USSR for so long that many thought they were better than this but now they've been exposed as the decrepit state they truly are and capable of.

What's happened is the whole Russian state was completely corrupted by Putin and his cronies because when it comes down to it the leaders of Russia were thieves and everyone below them were thieves because any competent people were removed from the system. In the end the whole thing has been exposed and now they have no way out.

Their industry is dying because the sanctions will lead to terminal decline as the parts needed to support them are blocked from being exported to their nation. They won't be able to finance their way out of this, wont be able to replace their equipment, they won't be able to invent new ways to win it will all implode sooner or later with no hope of a recovery so long as they continue to behave this way.

They're losing not just far too many military assets too quickly they're losing commanders, suffering shocking defeats of their military that can only be attributed to exhaustion and negligence. As for Ukraine not only have they held out against overwhelming odds but now they're finally receiving far more advanced weaponry from friendly neighbouring states that will tilt the battlefield balance completely in Ukraine's favour. More troops won't save the Russians their logistics simply cannot support their forces and without working equipment it will end up as a pointless slaughter for their people. The battlefield Balance of power will tilt so drastically for Ukraine that Russian's attacking will face certain death with no hope of victory.

As for their diplomacy, their country's bullshit has finally been called, everyone's had enough of them, their so called friends aren't going to bail them out as the depravity of what they did in Bucha and other places is not only being recorded, exposed and catalogued but every atrocity, every horror they inflict out of spite against Ukraine who refuses to yield to their corrupt nation will come back to haunt them. They'll be a pariah state, sanctioned and embargoed and completely cut off from most advanced neighbours and until Vladmir the Vainglorious goes either from being removed, executed or captured and handed over to the Hague and the animals who instigated these atrocities are held to account they'll never be forgiven for this for a long time.

It also means that Russian advances will have to slow soon and wel be seeing more slow, entrenched combat for even smaller gains.

Against single-charge warheads (i.e. most older Russian RPG models), it's highly effective, the slatted armour detonates the warhead which then doesn't do its thing of melting through the tank armour.

The problem for Russia is that Ukraine has plentiful stocks of guided weapons like the Javelin which have a tandem-charge warhead where the leading charge is designed to defeat slatted armour or ERA.

The Russians *do* have tandem charge warheads - the RPG-29 has one by default with the PG-29V, the newer RPG-30 and 32 employ good systems for defeating ERA which include a tandem warhead amongst a more complex package, and a tandem warhead has even been developed for the older RPG-7 to keep it a viable unguided (and therefore a cheap and quick secondary/non-specialist) anti-tank platform... however it remains to be seen whether they have any of them in quantity or are able to use them effectively.

The RPG-30 is an actually decent bit of kit, although its trickery is predominantly aimed at tricking active protection systems.

Also, unlike Ukraine who are awash with guided systems, none of Russia's man-portable systems are guided. They have ATGMs but they're heavier.

That being said, I don't think he will do it. I think the media has ran with the irresponsible words of the British SecDef and that they are going to announce the referendums in the newly liberated Donbas area and begin to train/move conscripts into those regions to reinforce the fronts.

i hesitate to see this. Ukrainian sources don't make public their methodology(duh), but comparing their numbers to other sources i have yet to see evidence they categorically overestimate numbers. Rather, i'd argue that they have been reliable and corroborated enough that they are likely the *best guess*  Ukraine has. Which means that they can just as well underestimate as they can overestimate.

If, on the other hand, you were to argue that those numbers are inflated because of propaganda, then i think you should not take them as an upper bound either. If they're being faked, then those numbers have zero reasons to be correlated to the truth. We don't take Russian numbers of losses as a lower bound either, we ignore any Russian numbers in a serious discussion.

This is a misunderstanding of my argument. Here's what I said:

> Public declarations that Ukraine was going to join NATO- while knowing full well that it would result in Russia taking actions like invading to prevent it- was a mistake on the part of the United States. I blame the US government for precipitating the deteriorating diplomatic situation in 2021, and I blame the US for not taking steps to better prepare Ukraine beforehand ...  the least we should have done was give the woman a big gun immediately after complimenting her looks in front of a rapist.

My ""arming Ukraine"" remark was based on the US acting recklessly diplomatically prior to the war. That recklessness should have warranted additional armament for Ukraine as we should have recognized that war was coming as soon as Russia restarted its military buildup last fall. As far as we know, the US was sucked into desultory talks designed to run out the clock while Russia finished its buildup... which was another mistake.

> In conclusion, I think you’re Chomsky-esque where you’d have and will blame the US regardless of what they do.

You're welcome to reach all of the wrong conclusions about me all you'd like. Feel free to stick your head in the sand about the run up to the conflict. Our diplomatic corps did the same thing you just did and the current conflict is the result.

This is not a question of what Ukraine can and cannot do- Ukraine can obviously desire to join NATO, the EU, or whatever they want. The real question is how the US uses its power in geopolitics to shape outcomes to our benefit. 

It's helpful to ask this question: Is a war between Russia and Ukraine a good thing for the US? I personally don't think so. This conflict is going to be disastrous for the global order; while the fighting is current constrained in and around Ukraine, the global economy is still in shock. Europe is staring down an energy crisis, there's talk of an impending famine in the Middle East, Africa/South America are likely going to be experiencing their own crisis in the next year, and Europe is absorbing millions of refugees.

> Military leaders and senior tsarist officials agreed before the war that Russia was a much stronger nation and had little to fear from the Empire of Japan. The fanatical zeal of the Japanese infantrymen astonished the Russians, who were dismayed by the apathy, backwardness, and defeatism of their own soldiers.[79] The defeats of the Army and Navy shook Russian confidence. Throughout 1905, the Imperial Russian government was rocked by revolution. The population was against escalation of the war. The empire was certainly capable of sending more troops but this would make little difference in the outcome due to the poor state of the economy, the embarrassing defeats of the Russian Army and Navy by the Japanese, and the relative unimportance to Russia of the disputed land made the war extremely unpopular.[80] Tsar Nicholas II elected to negotiate peace so he could concentrate on internal matters after the disaster of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905.

Tbf that's not a crazy idea, but it ought to fail a basic smell test for anyone doing even a casual analysis.

The smell test failure is this:  if Russia were capable of taking that approach, they would have done so already.  There is an organizational-psychological factor here that you have to take into account.

I don't know how to explain Putin's insane, self-defeating haste in his untenable plan for sweeping through Ukraine.  I am no expert.  I am no Kremlinologist.  But even a mere educated lay person should be able to tell that -- whatever the reason may be -- that insane self-defeating haste is there.  It is a factor.

Putin is running out of something:  time, money, supporters in the Kremlin, promises, whatever it is.  He is running out of it fast and that is forcing the pace of Russian action, to Russia's great detriment.

So anyone who can't explain that, or whose predictions don't take that into account, is doing it wrong.  Even if they have all the credentials in the world.

U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska largely denied the Post's motion to dismiss, allowing the suit to proceed. The Post subsequently settled the case for an undisclosed sum. In several stories on the day of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the Post inaccurately reported that twelve people had died, and that a Saudi national had been taken into custody as a suspect, which was denied by Boston Police.

The theory is that you keep your Javelin factory producing a few per day to replace what is used in training, slowly build a stockpile, etc, as opposed to working like mad to produce 1 million in a year then shutting down. This is better for the factory, as it keeps the people employed and trained long term and doesn't require constantly repurposing the building between different production runs. It also works well for the military as they don't have to figure out where to store 1 million Javelins for the next decade when they only expend a relative few at a time for training.

The challenge is that when the military isn't just using a few per day in training anymore, how fast can the factory adjust?

Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/). 
► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump [real estate to launder money](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider business prospects. Seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob, then evolved into something far bigger.
► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))
► Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. He became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.
► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.
► According to Celebrity Apprentice talent handler, Noel Casler, Felix Sater was a frequent guest at the CA afterparties, especially the ones held at Trump Soho in 2010. He made introductions between Ivanka and the wealthy Russians that made up most of the guest list. 
► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, Trump sold a Palm Beach mansion for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value. 
► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. Russian Mafia has been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. 
► From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""
►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). 
► According to a Bloomberg investigation (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”
► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich. 
► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. They have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States for years.
►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.
► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnell got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. 
► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, Sept 9-11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets."" 
► Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”
► Russian oligarchs [co-signed](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lawrence-odonnell-source-says-russian-oligarchs-co-signed-trumps-deutsche-bank-loans) Trump's Deutsche Bank loans
**Trump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:** ► At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies made a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. Out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's invasion of Afghanistan.
► Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. ""I don't care, I believe Putin""
► Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in Nov 2018 without note takers. 19 days later he announced a withdrawal from Syria. Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.
► Withdrew troops from Syria on Putin's birthday, and [gave the US military base to the Russians](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-russia/russia-lands-forces-at-former-u-s-air-base-in-northern-syria-idUSKBN1XP0XN)
► Refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.
► He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events.
► Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe and the US with impunity. The US already has the weapons that the INF bans so this offers us literally nothing
► Demanded Russia get invited back into G7
► Pushed the CIA to [give American intelligence to the Kremlin](https://www.justsecurity.org/71279/trump-pushed-cia-to-give-intelligence-to-kremlin-while-taking-no-action-against-russia-arming-taliban/)
► Withdrew from the Open Skies treaty which allows America to watch Russia's nuclear arsenal 
► Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead American soldiers and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this writing.
► Announced troop withdrawal from Germany (America's missile defense from Russia and forward operating base against Russian aggression)
► Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, which is so catastrophically stupid, that it would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason
► Trump knew since Mar 2020 that Russia paid bounties to kill American troops. On July 29, Trump defended Russia arming the Taliban against the US saying the US once did the same thing",False,1651529793.0,t3_ugq1y4,t1_i7306ei,,4,10,0,10,0,0,

5b8cbab228c0a2e98d77b62e1efe4c5a,ugq1y4,i747f00,"> and Russia still invaded - what would your stance be then?

I've read accounts that one of the reasons that Russia decided that *now* was the time to invade was several statements made by the White House in 2021 affirming Ukraine eventually joining NATO. From what I read, the first statement cause Russia to start a buildup on the Ukrainian border last spring, and after that statement was walked back Russia ceased their buildup. It was only after a second statement affirming Ukraine's NATO membership in the late summer that Russia restarted their buildup and then started dragging out negotiations... leading to the conflict we're seeing today.

In other words, I feel that had the US not made those statements, then it is quite possible that Russia would never had invaded at all. Alternatively, once we realized that Russia was going to invade (by late Nov/early Dec), we should have prepared to arm Ukraine with substantial reinforcements in order to deter Russian aggression.

I know that's not quite the answer you were looking for, but I really do think that there were things that could have been done to prevent the current conflict. 

On the other hand, I'll be nice and follow through your hypothetical to the end:

If the US did not help precipitate the war, then the US bears no responsibility if Russia invaded. There's no hand-wringing from me on this point.

**Edit: My intended reply as the comments are locked:**

 > Had the US not made those statements, and Russia still invaded, what would your point have been then?

I already answered this here: ""On the other hand, I'll be nice and follow through your hypothetical to the end ... If the US did not help precipitate the war, then the US bears no responsibility if Russia invaded. There's no hand-wringing from me on this point.""

Is there anything confusing about this?

> Seems antithetical to your rapist analogy above, since now you’re saying the US bears some responsibility for Russia invading. Ergo, of course. And this my friend, is where I knew you were going, and is such a pathetic pov to me that I just can’t go along.

How is it antithetical?

If you'd reread my first comment you'd see these statements by me: 

> Do you bear *any* responsibility for publicly buying and having the woman wear even more revealing clothes? Do you bear *any* responsibility for ignoring the environment around you while pouring gasoline onto a situation that might result in a conflagration?

This analogy is clear: Much like the bystander bears responsibility for making the woman a more attractive target for a known predator, the US bears responsibility for hitting Russia's paranoia in such a way that they felt that they needed to invade. Again, this is not blaming the US for the invasion- this is blaming the US for mucking up our diplomacy to a point where we could not prevent it.

> And this my friend, is where I knew you were going, and is such a pathetic pov to me that I just can’t go along.

I've said this repeatedly and haven't hidden my position on this, though it appears that some can't separate ""US is responsible for its own diplomacy"" from ""US to blame regardless."" I'm disappointed that even now, you still haven't understood my position.

Again, feel free to come to the wrong conclusions about my positions. All I ask that you not straw man me.

I'll leave you with this (from my first comment):

> **Don't mistake my position here: Putin and his cronies rightly bear the responsibility for invading** ...

The attempt failed badly, and in hindsight one can see why it was a bad idea: even if such economic ties made it irrational and counterproductive for Russia to behave, well, like it has been behaving, autocrats cannot be trusted to behave rationally and in the interest of their own country.

The loudest, clearest signal possible.

Revealing what they knew in real time came at a huge long-term cost to NATO, revealing those capabilities was an enormous thing to sacrifice.  Far bigger than the mere monetary cost of supplying modern weapons to Ukrainian defenders.  Those intelligence capabilities are among NATO's most precious assets.  Far more than the number of shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapons they are willing to put into play.

NATO being willing to pay that cost of intelligence sacrifice absolutely meant that they were willing to support Ukraine in other, lesser ways -- the whole point was to warn Putin of that fact and try to deter the actual invasion.  A warning which everyone in the Kremlin evidently ignored.

At that point, the only reason to continue to believe that Russia would somehow swiftly prevail was a) if you worshipped the legend of Russian military prowess beyond reason, or b) were deeply convinced that even with all the intelligence and equipment NATO had to offer, Ukrainians would simply choose not to defend their country.

 Yes, Russia would have done a lot better if they were better at this - but Kyiv is a giant city and the street battles would have taken more then 3 days. Just look at how it's going in Mariupol, which is a city of 400 thousand when compared to Kyiv which is a city of 3 million with a giant river running through it.

 Western predictions were completely unrealistic and an overcompensation of them missing the mark in the other direction during assessments of how Afganistant was going to go. Basically they had 0 clue as to how hard the Ukrainians would fight and assumed Ukrainians would crumble immediately due to superiority of Russian force concentrations.

 In the end I don't understand why so many on these subreddits are so invested in believing Ukrainian army isn't very competent and all of this is some sort of giant coincidence based on blind luck and Russian incompetence.

There are public actions, there is non-public, but they are still important - Russia is huge and communication is very bad. What is more or less known in Moscow (look at YouTube channel 1420) in a Siberia will be known in week (at best), at the Far North and some parts of Far East— in a month.

In small towns and villages there are some where only a couple of people in the entire town can read English, and the Internet is very poorly developed, so people don't understand what is going on, where and how. 

There are also villages, where not every village house has a TV. And these people also need a way to tell about what is happening and explain. 

The last large action we organized was the installation of homemade crosses (as on graves) in yards, forests and parks throughout Russia. 

The epitaph reported on Mariupol and its victims: adults and children. We managed to install 970 crosses in 73 cities across Russia. And if someone sees this cross and thinks about what's going on, it's already a big victory.

People on reddit often judge decisions and judgments by their own standards of living. But this situation is different, I've written before in my posts that the problem here is that there are literally 2 Russias - Russia of intellectuals and big cities, and Russia of the outer villages, small towns, not the European part, where ~40% of the population still live, who literally do not realize what is happening. 

All non-state media are blocked, propaganda is on all TV channels for 20-24 hours (also weather and sometimes movies about WWII). Plus, everything is greatly exacerbated by the way in which the ""troll factory"" is active; people trying to show reasonable sympathy for the victims are literally being pelted with shit by those who are paid to disseminate pro-war rhetoric. 

Of course, everything is exacerbated by the situation that Ukrainians are now, for obvious reasons, very embittered at absolutely all Russian speakers and are doing all kinds of things to kill all of us and our children in 10 generations, it certainly cannot help but shock if you are a primitive person who does not try to understand the motives that awaken such feelings. In fact, everyone is simply panicked and horrified by what is happening.

But this is exactly what the propaganda that denies the bloody episodes of this war uses: people there in power understand that the psyche of an ordinary worker cannot accept and understand the fact that his people and his military can commit serious crimes against humanity and they look for any justification for this. And the government throws in stories like ""it's a movie production and no one really died or suffered."" And people try to cling to that idea because that's the only scenario where everyone is actually alive and well. 

Do you get the idea? That is why it is so important to talk to people and calmly and tenderly explain to them that a nightmare is happening, that this nightmare even if you cannot stop it with your own hands alone, but in no way can you support it, you must respect and treat carefully the feelings of Ukrainians, you must seek the truth and protect yourself and your psyche from propaganda.",1651523245.0,1651521647.0,t3_ugq1y4,t1_i72gw4c,,6,4,0,4,0,0,

The initially successful offensive against the Republic of Estonia ignited the Estonian War of Independence which ended with the Soviet recognition of Estonia. The war against Republics of Latvia and Lithuania was more successful for the Soviets, and resulted in the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics being established.

I don't believe so. Even at the height of its unpopularity, it seems to me (but of course this is just my impression, I have no statistical data or anything of the sort) that it was well understood that Russia and the US were in no way comparable, that Russia was *far* less trustworthy, and that Putin in particular was a dangerous and ruthless autocrat. 

> Also, why do you think the EU needs an army? The EU is famous for bureaucracy and double institutions.

I think that the EU gets more flak that it deserves: whenever something goes wrong, it's easy for country governments to shift as much of the blame as they can onto the EU. Still, I agree that the EU is far from perfect, and that in particular it is much too slow in reacting to crises like this one. I think that the solution is more centralization, in all respects but *especially* when it comes to a more unitary and efficient foreign policy. 

It's always bizarre to see that many people (I'm not accusing you, to be clear) first loudly denounce the EU's (true or perceived) inefficiencies, then protest just as loudly against attempts to *address* these inefficiencies...

As for an army, in particular: it annoys me that an army is even *needed* - frankly, I think that it's a waste of perfectly good resources - but since clearly it is a necessity, it should be made as effective as possible. A single EU army would be able to react to emergencies much faster and more effectively than 27 different armies, and would also make it harder to play ""divide and conquer"" games against us all.",False,1651527158.0,t3_ugq1y4,t1_i72t2f6,,7,2,0,2,0,0,

It's the same doublespeak authoritarian enabling BS where Ukraine just needs to ""give Russia what they need"" to end this conflict. Not saying you're saying the Ukraine/Russia part, but you're using the same bad reasoning that is ignorant, willfully or otherwise, of all context and facts.

In the US, one side started waging political war long ago and delights in causing pain and mayhem for groups they don't like. The other side is starting to wake up after decades of abuse and is pissed off. The aggressors can either stop or this train is gonna keep rolling.

My concern is that, and I don’t know where you are from and/or if you are familiar with US college football, but I’d like to use this analogy. Plenty of underdog teams hold their own (sometimes leading) against Alabama in the first half only to get destroyed in the second. They don’t necessarily lose because they can’t win, but that Alabama has the resources and ability to adjust…and because the underdog gets overconfident, arrogant, exhausted, etc.

0fe1e1f66afc4402a35a9769e62c0fca,ugq1y4,i72oqrk,"I've been doing a lot of research on this issue in the last few weeks and so far I've realized the following:

The fact that not all refugees are kidnapped, as they write about it here, is 200%. Every third Russian has relatives in Ukraine and I understand why some refugees prefer to go to Russia, if they already have a house/apartment, where they can live for free, people who are ready to feed and help with money, knowledge of the language and a possibility to somehow arrange their life at least for a while. 

Another important point is, of course, where the person is coming from. To cross half of the country during wartime seems to me personally insane, if you can go out along a humanitarian corridor in the other direction, where someone who you know can meet you. 

I personally know several people who went to Moscow voluntarily, simply for economic reasons. People with such connections (and by our count 60-70% of the total number in Russia) usually have no problem with filtration camps (they pass the usual screening for ties with the Ukrainian armed forces) and are taken further by relatives/acquaintances who promise that their ""Ukrainians"" will not commit crimes against Russians. 

But it is also now becoming apparent that there is a certain percentage of those adults and especially orphaned children who were not asked when they were taken away. 

In international practice, this equates to genocide and is considered to be a process of kidnapping. These people are usually taken to Soviet sanatoriums and children's summer camps all over Russia, often far from major cities and far from capitals. Children are taken to orphanages across the country. 

Since these facilities are guarded and visitation is strictly regulated (at least it will be so until the end of the war) it is still difficult to imagine exactly how to contact these people. People from Russian cities who want to give humanitarian aid leave their belongings and food in special places at the entrances to these secure facilities. Some try to write letters and notes. 

However, judging from what we have recently established, between leaving the filtration camp (yes, it sounds terrible, but in fact it is a typical 1-3 day KGB-style check that almost all Soviet citizens underwent - interrogation by an investigator, background checks, document checks, all this, only rough and unpleasant) and placement in the new ""camp"" there is some ""window"" through which some Ukrainians managed to get out and leave. [For example, the incident with the buses to Estonia is well known (as far as I know more than a hundred people have already left through this route).](https://news.err.ee/1608573326/refugees-continuing-to-arrive-via-russia-tallinn-bus-station-overwhelmed)

And this suggests that authorities do not put a ban on Ukrainians leaving Russia (yet) in this temporary ""window"", although it is possible that upon arrival at the new place of residence they sign papers that they will not leave the country/current region for 1/3/5 years (this was the practice in the USSR).",1651524417.0,1651524210.0,t3_ugq1y4,t1_i72kfyy,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
