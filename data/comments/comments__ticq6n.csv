> 
> Date of publication: 20.03.2022
> 
> * According to a poll conducted by the Rating Sociological Group on March 18, 77% of respondents believe that things in Ukraine are moving in the right direction. Only 14% disagreed, 10% could not assess. In all regions and among all age groups, the assessment of the direction as correct dominates.
> 
> * **Belief in victory remains at the highest level: 93% of respondents believe that Ukraine will be able to repel Russia's attack.** Confidence in victory prevails in all regions of the country.
> 
> * **Half (47%) of respondents hope that Ukraine will be able to win the war with Russia in the next few weeks.** A quarter (23%) believe that the war will last several months. Only 12% think that the war will end in six months or more. There are almost no people who do not believe in victory at all. 17% have not yet been able to answer this question.
>  
> * Inflation, rising prices (45%) and fuel shortages (38%) are threats that Ukrainians believe are likely to arise in the next few months. Depreciation of the hryvnia and disruption of the sowing campaign is probable by no more than a quarter of respondents, hunger - 13%. Residents of the eastern regions are slightly more afraid of these threats than residents of other macro-regions.
>  
> * The vast majority of respondents (82%) consider the threat of splitting the country unlikely, this confidence has increased significantly due to the cohesion of the population during the war.
>  
> * According to Ukrainians, the most friendly to Ukraine today are Poland, Lithuania, Great Britain and the United States. The Czech Republic, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, Turkey, France and Slovenia are also considered friendly. **About half of those polled are friendly to Hungary, Georgia and Germany, and another third are neutral.**
>  
> * China is now a mostly neutral country for Ukrainians. While Russia (98%) and Belarus (84%) are hostile countries for Ukrainians. Attitudes toward these countries have deteriorated significantly since they started the war against Ukraine. Also, the attitude of Ukrainians towards China has slightly deteriorated. Almost nothing has changed - to Germany, Hungary, Georgia. Improved to Turkey, France, Poland, Lithuania, Britain, USA, Romania.
>  
> * At the same time, regional consolidation has strengthened significantly in international sentiment: if in the past the east and south were colder towards the United States and other western countries, now these countries are equally friendly to residents of all macro-regions. The same applies to hostile countries - Russia and Belarus are hostile countries for the vast majority of Ukrainians, regardless of place of residence.
>  
> * 74% support Zelensky's direct talks with Putin on ending the war, a quarter do not. Slightly more supporters of direct talks in the South and East, but in other regions as well, the majority.
>  
> * At the same time, signing a temporary truce with Russia without withdrawing its troops from Ukraine is unacceptable (89%).
>  
> * Support for the creation of a military-political union of Ukraine, Poland and the United Kingdom increased from 61% (in January) to 85%. Today, support for such an alliance is higher than support for Ukraine's integration with NATO (72%).
>  
> * 44% believe that Ukraine should join NATO, 42% - that Ukraine should continue to cooperate with NATO, but not become a member of the Alliance. More people support NATO cooperation outside of the Alliance than before the war, a figure that has risen at the expense of those who previously said there was no need to cooperate with NATO at all (currently only 7%). Most proponents of accession are from the western, central regions, the South and the East, and are more supportive of non-Alliance cooperation.
>  
> Audience: the population of Ukraine aged 18 and older in all oblasts, except for the temporarily occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas. The sample is representative by age, sex and type of settlement. Sample population: 1000 respondents. Survey method: CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews). Error of representativeness of the study with a confidence level of 0.95: not more than 3.1%. Dates: March 18, 2022

> Dagestan ranked first in the Russian Federation in the number of servicemen killed in action while invading Ukraine.
> 
> This is evidenced even by the greatly understated Russian data. As of the moment of publication, there were already 40 identified soldiers killed belonging to the peoples of Dagestan.
> 
> The real scale of losses across the republic is unknown. Sources of Kavkaz.Realii in the government of Dagestan have reported at least 130 contract soldiers killed in Ukraine. There are also dead conscripts, whose number remains unknown.
> 
> Real statistics with the regional breakdown across Russia is not yet available. However, it is already clear that Dagestan has to pay more for Putin’s whim than many other entities of the Russian Federation.
> 
> The reason is that regions such as Dagestan are traditional suppliers of “cannon fodder” for the greatness of the empire. Russian officials have led the republic to one of the lowest scores of social and economic development in Russia: they have the lowest salaries and the highest level of corruption. The situation is further complicated by a high birth rate and total unemployment. The despair pushes young men to pursue a career in the army.
> 
> However, it is good to serve in the army in peacetime. In wartime, soldiers die. And in Ukraine, they die a lot.

> Alright Lady's & Gentlemen, boys and girls, it is time for another Truck logistics thread🧵 for this latest Russian Invasion of Ukraine.
> 
> In it we are going to discuss the concept of ""Operational Attrition"" as applied to the Russian Army truck fleet in combat.
> 
> In my now widely read thread on poorly maintained, cheap Chinese made, truck tires, I explained how Russia lost trucks & mobility by not maintaining tires.
> 
> This loss of vehicles without a shot being fired is referred to as ""Operational Attrition.""
> 
> That is, just by operating vehicles, you lose some of them because they break.
> 
> This gets a lot worse in combat. Each mile traveled by a military truck in war is between 10 and 20 miles wear. This is simple.
> 
> Most of the time between 2012 and 2022 the Russian Army did not maintain their trucks.
> 
> The Russians don't have a professional NCO Corps so they ARE NOT DOING IT NOW.
> 
> The overriding priority of Russian logistics is transporting artillery ammunition. 
> 
> Every truck is being sent out in whatever condition, overloaded with ammunition.
> 
> The engines are running white hot and no one has checked the oil or other fluid levels, let alone does an oil change, in these last three weeks.
> 
> And running overloaded by artillery ammunition trucks through previously destroyed convoys like this are going to shred even good tires and catch road debris in CTIS and pneumatic brake hoses.
> 
> Plus driving through/around this takes more time.
> 
> And then there is the ""conscript factor.""  Who do you think were towing the helicopters in this video?  Russian conscripts, that's who.
> 
> What does that mean in a panicked evacuation?  
> 
> They pulled those choppers as fast as they could get 15km of so ...out of artillery range.  The choppers were trash at that point.  
> 
> However, after that, those guys slowed the <bleep> down & took their time dragging those choppers to their drop off point so they had as much ""safe time"" as they could before the next artillery ammo run.
> 
> The cumulative effects of all these factors leads to horrendous levels of Russian Army Truck fleet operational attrition.
> 
> Short form: 6-to-8 weeks more fighting will deadline the entire Russian Army military truck fleet.

> Ukraine has claimed that more than 50 elderly people were killed in “a horrific act of genocide” at a care home after a Russian tank fired at the building.

> The allegation, which could not be independently verified, was made by Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman, in a report on her Telegram channel.

> “Today it became known about another terrible crime against humanity committed by the racist occupation forces — the shooting of 56 elderly people in Luhansk region,” she wrote. “In the town of Kreminna on March 11, the Russian occupiers cynically and purposefully fired from a tank at a home for the elderly.”

> The claim followed growing anger about Russian artillery and airstrikes hitting residential areas, including a school and a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of women and children were said to be among those taking refuge.

> Denisova said the 56 elderly victims in Kreminna, in the east of the country, had “died on the spot” on March 11 while 15 survivors were “abducted” and taken to an institution in Svatove, a town in “occupied territory”.",False,1647810188.0,t3_ticq6n,t3_ticq6n,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

,ticq6n,i1ebyan,"In the context of what is going on, for some reason I often think of one episode of the Russian comedy sitcom series ""The Unprincipled,"" which mocked the limited and corrupt nature of people in power... including the military.

There was such an episode: an elderly very corrupt general with dirty hands tries to improve relations with his wife. She, in turn, out of boredom went to an ""insta-specialist"" who studies the ""karma"" of his patients. Naturally, he tells her that because of her husband and their lifestyle (grotesque luxury at the expense of bribes and killing innocent people) her karma is shit...

She starts trying to clean up her karma, signs up for meditation, tries to get rid of her souvenir weapons at home, starts going to training sessions with a spiritual guru on Instagram. Her husband dislikes this of course, eventually they have a fight and end up fighting. She declares to him that she doesn't intend to tolerate his bloodshed any longer, slams the door and figuratively slaps him in the face with her Birkin. 

He, in turn, is terribly saddened and all department cannot work (because of bunch of his entire service and officers are also depressed). A few days later comes the news that his wife and that instagram guru are going on a karma-cleansing trip to Bali to the holy places.

One of his colonels asks if he can help his commander to the best of his ability. He agrees.

! The next day Indonesia is on fire. A separatist movement has magically received 30 billion$ to fight against the ""pro-Western"" oppressors, the whole country is in revolution, all flights there have been cancelled. It came so far that they even changed the president to separatist and all this protesters were like, what a gift from heaven for our freedom?…

The general's wife tries to call her guru, but alas, he does not answer the phone. She thinks that he has lied to her and stolen her payment for trip. She decided to return to her husband and his money. In fact, even yesterday a black voronok came for the guru, they accused him of motherlan’s treason, and working like American spy against Glory of Indonesian Revolution (you remember that they planned to visit Bali) and now he is just jailed somewhere in Siberia.

 **Kyiv region**
 The night passed relatively calmly, despite constant air alarms.  The enemy refused to take active action and actively dug in, erected fortifications, trying to establish logistics.
 Fighting and shelling in Makarov, Bucha, Gostomel, Vorzel.  The invader is conducting chaotic shelling of social infrastructure and housing estates.  The movement of the enemy was recorded in Vyshhorod district and in Brovarsky district.

 **Chernihiv region**
 Defense of Chernihiv, shelling of the city, yesterday shelling of high-rise buildings, industrial areas.  At night - air alarms in Chernihiv and the region.  There is no light, heating, communication problems in Chernihiv, most of them without gas.

 Standard night alarms.  Missile strike on one of the villages of Korosten district.  The industrial building was destroyed.  There are no victims

 **Kharkiv region**
 There were several attacks in Kharkiv at night, there are fires in residential buildings, rescuers are working.  In the evening, two civilians, including a 9-year-old child, were killed in the latest shelling in the HTZ area.
 Attacks from the sky over Kharkiv have significantly decreased.  Today, reconnaissance aircraft are being recorded.
 The Armed Forces of Ukraine in some areas went on the counterattack, and enemy columns were broken up on long approaches to Kharkiv.  Yesterday in the Dergachiv district a mobile unit of the National Guard destroyed a large number of manpower and equipment of the occupiers.
 The Russians are trying to break in the direction of Izyum, but the Armed Forces are fighting.

 **Zaporizhzhia region**
 The night passed without change.  According to the instructions of the military, a curfew has been imposed from 16:00 on Saturday until 16:00 on Saturday.

**Luhansk region**
 Lysychansk and Rubizhne were shelled at night.  There was a humanitarian corridor yesterday, so the situation was more or less calm in Severodonetsk.  But in a day in Severodonetsk and Rubizhne about 30 objects were damaged or destroyed.

 **Donetsk region**
 The night is restless.  Shelling along the entire line: Avdiivka, Maryinka, Toretsk.  Marinka - attempts to break through.  The city is badly beaten.
 Difficult situation in Mariupol.  There is famine in the city.  Street fights in the city.  People are trying to leave the city on their own.
 Many refugees gathered in the occupied settlements near Mariupol - Mangush, Melekine.
 In the rest of the region, the situation is tense, but mostly under control, except for Volnovakha.

 **Mykolayiv region**
 There were shellings of the city from hail, air alarm.  Fighting continues in the region.  Evacuation from the defended villages and delivery of the humanitarian woman is underway.  In some settlements there is no heat and light.

**Kherson region**
 The night was restless, the sounds of explosions and shelling could be heard in the region.  This information is being clarified.  In general, the situation in the Kherson region is getting closer to critical.  In most remote areas and communities where Russians live, it is almost a humanitarian catastrophe.
 The number of places where Russians distribute their aid is increasing every day.  All this is done during the filming of Russian media cameras.

I actually don't think this was a Python bot or anything, I think this guy genuinely just had a bunch of different accounts opened in different windows, cause he replies in a non botty way from them from time to time.  This is called sockpupeting, where the accounts aren't bots, but it's inorganic behavior and trying to game the system all the way.

Ukrainian patience in letting the fight mostly come to them, aside from striking out at lightly defended convoys/scouting missions, has left them successfully in control of the majority of Russian primary objectives. 

Short of a big infusion of troops and armor, or a significant increase in air power, Russia is left to continue its war of attrition against the population of the areas it controls. Now that it is, on most fronts, defending, the onus is on the Ukrainians to dislodge them. An offensively-minded armed force - especially one spread as thin as the Ukrainian armed forces - has to only attack when almost assured of an overwhelming superiority of forces: either numerically, technologically or some blend of both. 

Building up that capacity while simultaneously defending without much resupply (in the East/South) seems out of the range of possibility for the time being. I wonder if we will not see much change in battle lines in those theaters in the near future. 

That leaves the north. I wonder if the Ukrainian Armed forces are playing the waiting game - building up non-core forces (from what I've read, most foreign volunteers are being sent to Kyiv to defend) so the main army can launch counter-offensives against established Russian positions starved of resupply by their flanking hit-and-run attacks against Russian FOB's and command centers behind the ""main line.""

Russia likely can't supply many more troops in the field based on current conditions (although this is speculative).

We know they are calling in more forces from the other side of the country, how much is speculative.

The large numbers of equipment loss and failure are likely to continue.

Assessment: If Ukraine can keep them at a halt now, as more allied weapons and equipment flow in, this will be a long and dirty war but Ukraine will likely win in the end. But based on the current conditions, it'll be at a great cost... I can't see Mariupol lasting more than another week or two based on supply shortages and reporting of starvation of a week or longer so far.

Secondary Assessment: any further brutality and possible loss of Mariupol will act as a martyrs call to fight on. The fight will take a long long time as Russia is crippled by losses and logistics and Ukraine by a lack of mobility equipment and air power.

Summary: this is going to be long, bloody and slow.

I'm erring on the side of Ukraine beginning to push back in the next month or so, but it will be brutal on the Ukrainian people in that time.

This is entirely subject to how many more forces Russia commits. The more it commits, the more it's fucked long-term, and it isn't pretty even at this stage for them. Not even to mention the logistics and supply issues.",1647751628.0,1647751474.0,t3_ticq6n,t3_ticq6n,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia sent four warships not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and going either through the Horn of Africa, Suez Canal, and the Straight of Istanbul or through the arctic, Straight of Gibralter, Mediterranean Sea, and Straight of Istanbul, either of which route requiring them to get Turkey's permission and eventually taking them to the Black Sea. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. 

Day twenty-two: three guys from the Tennessee national guard were found in Ukraine, dead or maybe actually alive and still fighting, we're not sure. Is NATO going to be pulled in and start WWIII because of foreign volunteers? Better stop allowing them! 

Day twenty-three: Russia is sending their generals to the frontlines. Putin just spoke to a loud group. Russia is revitalized and starting *right now* will take the war seriously. 

Day twenty-four: Russia says it used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for first time. Russia actively mobilizes male population.

Day twenty-five: Greatest hits compilation. Syrian forces are finally ready, another Mose Schrute brought a surviving Chechen brigade to Ukraine, and Russia bombs more shelters. This time all of these repeated failures will work though.

It only takes one person in Russian gov to start thinking “hey, this isn’t working. This is getting out of hand” and you’ve got an internal power struggle on your hands. Even if 99% of Putin’s inner circle is loyal, it only takes that 1% who are disloyal to throw the whole operation under the bus.

Edit: and if things start going seriously wrong, like the military starts breaking down en masse, or logistical issues start mounting up, or the economic situation becomes dire, Putin is at serious risk of having a plot developed against him aimed at labelling him the fall guy and using him as a figurehead for all the failures.

Russia? They have apparently blown their load of Iskanders, so now it’s Kinzhal time. Use it once, I would normally view it as a veiled threat or a signal, like Sputnik’s significance - sure, it’s just a satellite/warhead, but it could be a *nuclear* warhead. Use it twice? Thrice? Now you’re just wasting Kinzhals, and you’re still not nuking anyone.

Word is they put Mig31s with Kinzhal capability in Prussia, to warn off the West. Heh. Where’s that “day x” post that keeps up with Russia’s proclamations of superiority when we need it? Air Superiority, oh no! Chechens, oh no! Real troops next! Super tanks! Convoys! And now, Kinzhals!

> **Fierce fighting continues in Mariupol as negotiators note ‘convergence’ on some issues**

> Russia and Ukraine “have almost reached agreement” on four critical points of a potential peace agreement, Turkey’s foreign minister said, as fierce fighting continued to devastate the key port city of Mariupol.

> Mevlut Cavusoglu told Turkey’s pro-government Hurriyet newspaper that there was a growing “convergence” between Moscow and Kyiv after a bout of intense diplomacy over the past week.

> “On important subjects, critical subjects, there is a convergence between the two sides,” Cavusoglu said. “Especially on the first four points we see that they have almost reached agreement.”

> Turkey, which is mediating in the talks alongside Israel, said Ukraine and Russia had made significant progress on Kyiv declaring neutrality and abandoning its drive for Nato membership, “demilitarising” Ukraine in exchange for collective security guarantees, what Russia calls “denazification”, and lifting restrictions on the use of Russian in Ukraine.

> Some issues would need to be agreed between presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Cavusoglu said, adding that the two leaders did not appear to have “a negative stance” on that idea in principle.

> A possible agreement would require Russia to announce a ceasefire and withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory to the positions they had been in when Putin launched a full-blown invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

The irony is, Putin's circle also miscalculated because they are also guilty of war crimes. Especially the head of the FSB that poisoned so many critics.

**The Coming Ukrainian Insurgency**  
Russia’s Invasion Could Unleash Forces the Kremlin Can’t Control.  
By Douglas London.  
February 25, 2022  
Russian forces have struck targets across Ukraine and seized key facilities and swaths of territory. The Ukrainian military is no match for this Russian juggernaut. Although some reports suggest Ukrainian troops have rebuffed attacks in certain parts of the country, it seems more likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin will decide just how far Russia goes into Ukraine. As a retired Russian-speaking CIA operations officer who served in Central Asia and managed agency counterinsurgency operations, I did not think Putin would have attacked Ukraine unless he had already devised a reliable end game, given the costs of an intractable conflict. But Putin’s best-laid plans might easily unravel in the face of popular Ukrainian national resistance and an insurgency.

If Russia limits its offensive to the east and south of Ukraine, a sovereign Ukrainian government will not stop fighting. It will enjoy reliable military and economic support from abroad and the backing of a united population. But if Russia pushes on to occupy much of the country and install a Kremlin-appointed puppet regime in Kyiv, a more protracted and thorny conflagration will begin. Putin will face a long, bloody insurgency that could spread across multiple borders, perhaps even reaching into Belarus to challenge Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin’s stalwart ally. Widening unrest could destabilize other countries in Russia’s orbit, such as Kazakhstan, and even spill into Russia itself. When conflicts begin, unpredictable and unimaginable outcomes can become all too real. Putin may not be prepared for the insurgency—or insurgencies—to come.

**WINNER’S REMORSE**  
Many a great power has waged war against a weaker one, only to get bogged down as a result of its failure to have a well-considered end game. This lack of foresight has been especially palpable in troubled occupations. It was one thing for the United States to invade Vietnam in 1965, Afghanistan in 2001, and Iraq in 2003; likewise for the Soviet Union to enter Afghanistan in 1979. It was an altogether more difficult task to persevere in those countries in the face of stubborn insurgencies.Any future insurgency will benefit from Ukraine’s geography. The country is bordered by four NATO states: Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Belarus, a Russian ally, is itself bordered by Poland on the west and another NATO member—Lithuania—on the north. These long borders offer the United States and NATO an enduring way to support Ukrainian resistance and a long-term insurgency and to stoke unrest in Belarus should the United States and its allies choose to covertly aid opposition to Lukashenko’s regime.

Moldova, to the southwest of Ukraine, is also an intriguing player. Although nominally neutral (neutrality is written into its constitution), Moldova has cooperated in the past with the United States and NATO; it has a somewhat frigid relationship with Moscow thanks to ongoing tensions over the breakaway republic of Transnistria, a narrow strip of land along the Moldovan-Ukrainian border. Moscow props up this separatist entity, which is garrisoned by Russian troops in the name of “peacekeeping.” Its role in Transnistria is pushing Moldova toward the West. Last November, Maia Sandu, a former Moldovan prime minister, defeated the Russia-backed incumbent president. Moldova is not likely to overtly provoke the Kremlin, but Sandu might be willing to covertly cooperate with Ukraine’s resistance.

As the United States learned in Vietnam and Afghanistan, an insurgency that has reliable supply lines, ample reserves of fighters, and sanctuary over the border can sustain itself indefinitely, sap an occupying army’s will to fight, and exhaust political support for the occupation at home. Russia would also have to think twice before trying to chase insurgents across the border into Poland, for instance, since such actions could trigger war with NATO.  


**LINES OF SUPPORT**  
The United States will invariably be a major and essential source of backing for a Ukrainian insurgency. During the Obama and Trump administrations, the United States acted with restraint in responding to Russian cyberattacks, disinformation, and military expansionism. Washington did not want to unleash a spiral of escalation it could not control, risking Russian reprisals against U.S. banks, businesses, and infrastructure. The Biden administration, however, has so far been less tentative in its dealings with Russia. To counter Russian moves, it has exposed Russia-associated hackers and recovered funds stolen through cyberattack ransoms, extradited Russian oligarchs to stand trial in the United States, and declassified intelligence on Russian plans in Ukraine to unify support among allies and shape the media narrative.

If a viable, independent Ukraine remains standing, whether ruled from Kyiv or Lviv (the largest city in the western part of the country), the United States and its NATO allies can openly aid in its in defense with weapons, training, and cash. It’s reasonable to deduce that the CIA’s legal charter to partner with foreign intelligence counterparts has allowed it to provide training and materials to its Ukrainian partners for years, just as U.S. military trainers have worked with and supplied their Ukrainian counterparts.

This aid will have to become covert if Russia seizes the government and fully occupies the country. Military support for action against a sovereign country with which the United States is not at war has to be clandestine, much like U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union in the 1980s, for Iraq’s Kurds prior to the 2003 invasion, and, less successfully, for rebels in Syria a decade ago. Attacking behind enemy lines would require a presidential covert action finding funded by Congress. Of course, a version of this authorization probably already exists and might at most need modification by the White House as a new congressional Memorandum of Notification to accommodate the shifting circumstances.

Supporting an insurgency is in the CIA’s DNA. Its forerunner, the Office of Strategic Services, came into its own during World War II through supporting resistance forces in France, the Netherlands, and East Asia. The CIA’s recent experience in supporting and fighting insurgencies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria prepares it well for opposing Russia’s modern, conventional forces. The United States can help Ukrainian insurgents in hitting targets with the greatest military value and psychological impact.

A Yahoo News report in January described a covert CIA training program for elite Ukrainian special operations forces and other intelligence personnel that was launched in 2015 by the Obama administration following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. According to the report, the effort included the deployment of CIA paramilitary officers to Ukraine. Such programs mature over time as trust grows between the trainers and their foreign counterparts and as the recipients teach what they have learned to others.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials have long planned for this day. In all likelihood, a covert program to help organize the resistance to Russia already has communications infrastructure, intelligence collection capabilities, and operational plans in place. And the tactics developed to support defensive operations against an invader can transition to those aimed at hobbling an occupying force.",1647801990.0,1647798544.0,t3_ticq6n,t3_ticq6n,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

No, it’s not because of money. That’s backwards. They get support because of their opinions, not the other way around. No, it’s also not because they are extorted. No, it didn’t start 2016 or with Trump, as this article in The Atlantic seems to suggest. *1 Here’s some Putinology 101.

In short, it’s because Russia is a Christian ethnostate who take in few refugees, dislikes LGBT rights, and embraces traditional gender roles. From reading the comment to a current ”hot” post about Putin quoting Jesus, it seems that many in this sub don’t know this.

85% of Russians are reported to be Christian, spiritual, or atheists. *2 65% are reported to be members of the Russian Orthodox Church. *3 That church is lead by Patriarch Kirill, who is reported to be a long-time ally to Putin. *4 It’s reported that he has ”described Mr. Putin’s long rule as a “miracle of God.”” *5 And Putin seems to be an ally to Patriarch Kirill. It’s reported that Putin, in his Feb. 21 TV address, insisted that Zelenskij’s government was ""infringing on believers' rights"" and ""preparing the destruction"" of Ukraine's Moscow-linked church. *6 It has been described that Putin, in 2013, introduced a law that makes it a crime to “insult the feelings” of religious believers, and that the first conviction under that law was a sentencing to 120 hours of community labor after posting “insulting” online material about Orthodox Christianity. *5

Regarding LGBT and events before 2016, Russia adopted an ”anti-gay-law” in 2013, which meant that people disseminating ”propaganda” about homosexual relationships to minors risked fines. *7 In 2014, Pat Buchanan, former assistant and special consul to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, described that Putin was ”tapping into the worldwide revulsion of and resistance to the sewage of a hedonistic secular and social revolution coming out of the West”. He further wrote that ”in the culture war for the future of mankind, Putin is planting Russia’s flag firmly on the side of traditional Christianity”. *8

There is a lot more that can be said about this, but my comment is getting a bit long so I'll stop here.

1f63b0337ac72db66b0bdf895b6fbc6b,ticq6n,i1ei2xl,"Financial Times:  Russia and Ukraine edge towards agreement on key peace points, says Turkey

Russia and Ukraine “have almost reached agreement” on four critical points of a potential peace agreement, Turkey’s foreign minister said, as fierce fighting continued to devastate the key port city of Mariupol.

Mevlut Cavusoglu told Turkey’s pro-government Hurriyet newspaper that there was a growing “convergence” between Moscow and Kyiv after a bout of intense diplomacy over the past week.

“On important subjects, critical subjects, there is a convergence between the two sides,” Cavusoglu said. “Especially on the first four points we see that they have almost reached agreement.”

A possible agreement would require Russia to announce a ceasefire and withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory to the positions they had been in when President Vladimir Putin launched a full-blown invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

But Ukraine and its western allies are sceptical of Russia’s motives in negotiating a deal and fear Putin could be buying time to replenish Moscow’s forces and launch a new offensive.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Sunday that Russia had used “more destructive artillery”, including its new Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, against civilian areas.

Podolyak’s statement was the first confirmation from Ukraine that the Kremlin had deployed the missiles in combat for the first time this week.

Moscow claims it used the Kinzhal, which Russia says can travel at 10 times the speed of sound, twice in the past three days to destroy a fuel depot near Mykolayiv, a key city on the front in southern Ukraine, as well as to target a munitions storage facility in the country’s west.

Turkey, which is mediating in the talks alongside Israel, said Ukraine and Russia had made significant progress on Kyiv declaring neutrality and abandoning its drive for Nato membership, “demilitarising” Ukraine in exchange for collective security guarantees, what Russia calls “denazification”, and lifting restrictions on the use of Russian in Ukraine.

Even as negotiations progressed, Russian forces continued their intense assault of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, whose status is a key sticking point in the talks, according to two people briefed on them.

Ukraine’s armed forces said on Sunday that “the situation in Mariupol is difficult: there is famine in the city, street fights, people are trying to leave the city on their own”. The Russian forces have cut off electricity, heat, and food supplies.

Anna Romanenko, a local journalist who has evacuated from Mariupol but is still in contact with sources there, said there was heavy fighting in the centre, with Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers being attacked by Ukrainian government troops in and around Theatre Square, a prominent landmark.

“The front now runs straight through the city,” she said. Large parts of Mariupol, especially the left-bank district and some neighbourhoods in the north-west of the city, were fully in Russian hands, she said.

Russia is publicly sticking to the maximalist demands Putin made in the first days of the invasion, including vaguely defined calls to “demilitarise” and “denazify” Ukraine.

Moscow also wants Kyiv to recognise its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the independence of two Russia-backed separatist territories in the eastern Donbas border region.

As its invasion has stalled, however, Russia has quietly dropped its vow to remove Zelensky and dialled down suggestions of carving up the country into Moscow-backed fiefdoms and a rump state.

Ukraine has ruled out making territorial concessions to Russia under any circumstances and has said negotiations on the areas seized by Moscow before this year would require separate talks between Zelensky and Putin.

Mariupol is a particularly difficult issue because it is part of the Ukrainian-held territory claimed by the separatists.

Putin has justified the invasion by claiming Russia is liberating Ukraine from Nazis, even though Zelensky is Jewish and far-right nationalist groups have little influence in the country.",False,1647783980.0,t3_ticq6n,t3_ticq6n,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

> **Ukrainian president slams Berlin’s prioritization of economic ties with Russia over democratic values.**

> BERLIN — In a blistering speech to lawmakers in Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday accused politicians of failing to live up to their historical responsibility after the Holocaust — enshrined in the phrase “never again” — to secure peace in Europe.

> Zelenskyy, a Jewish president of a nation deeply scarred by millions of deaths in World War II and the Holocaust, lambasted Germany for pursuing a policy of appeasement toward Russia in recent years and for prioritizing economic security over democratic values.

> Amid heavy civilian losses from Russian bombardment, Ukraine insists that the EU must stop buying the oil and gas that helps fill President Vladimir Putin’s war chest. Germany, however, is the chief opponent to such a move, arguing that it has no alternative but to keep buying Russian energy.

> That German intransigence helped spark Thursday’s bitter address, in which the president pulled no punches in his condemnation.

> “After 80 years, something like this happens and I am telling you: Every year politicians repeat the words ‘never again’ and now we see that these words are simply worth nothing. In Europe a people is being destroyed. There is an attempt to destroy everything that is dear to us,” he said.

> Speaking via video link from Kyiv, Zelenskyy criticized Germany for years of prioritizing business in Russia above defending Western values.

The risk however is that it's too close to border with other countries.

3. Taking over Dnipro will be next target, as that will allow them to encircle the army in Donetsk and Luhansk. The question is whether Russia is willing to fight this war from months.

ecd8647d5fe3a62fc6cfba94a7bb3201,ticq6n,i1f922p,"Let's wargame this for a second. I know most people believe Putin will not use a nuclear weapon and that any talk of using nukes is ""war-mongering"" and trying to scare people. So, please understand I am not trying to do that - I am just wargaming here.

What does Putin have to lose by using a small nuke in Ukraine? Let's put ourselves in his shoes and think strategically for a moment. 

Putin is very insecure about masculinity and displaying strength is paramount to him. Using a small nuke in Ukraine would show to the world that he means business and is not screwing around. His way of showing the world that he has nukes, isn't afraid to use them, he is taking Ukraine, and everyone else needs to stay the hell out. 

What is the worst the world can do? More sanctions? Not much more the west can do besides actual combat, which the US and Europe are very reluctant to get into. I don't think using a small nuke would change his standing with China and other ""neutral"" nations. They will just somehow, in some twisted way, blame the West and Nato for Putin's use of a nuke (look at the latest opinion polls out of Asia). 

He has already used a hypersonic missile and a thermobaric bomb. Nothing really changed regarding his position in the world after using them. 

Perhaps his own people will be outraged by it, but I don't think most of them will be. Most Russians according to any internal or external poll support this war and generally buy into the BS on their state-run media. This matches my own experience talking to Russians. Most smart, younger Russians in the know are too afraid to speak up about it. Russian media can just claim to their own people that Ukraine or Nazis, Nato or whatever boogeyman did it instead. 

So, while I think there are some risk if Putin uses a nuke (mostly his own generals and military probably), the downsides are not that great. So, I think there is a real possibility of him using a small nuke in this conflict. I hope this doesn't happen, but for the reasons I have laid out, it is foolish to believe Putin would never do it.",False,1647795618.0,t3_ticq6n,t3_ticq6n,,0,-18,0,-18,0,0,

Also dangerous to be on foot in a grass fire as they burn very fast. Stay on the already burned side of the flamefront. Ultimately, it's probably not much that to a tank or other vehicles, and overall not actually that big of a risk. Just driving a vehicle off road can star fires.

Not wasting.  You need to understand that the original plan was for Russian armored columns to travel down the road from Belarus to surround and take Kyiv in a week.  After installing a puppet government and hosting sham referendums, the puppet government would sign a bill recognizing Crimea as officially a part of Russia, and Donetsk/Luhansk as a Russian protectorate.  And probably something to the tune of a treaty guaranteeing Ukrainian neutrality from NATO.  Obviously, this hasn't happened.  

So the new plan (until summer), apparently, is to cause as much damage as possible to *force* the Ukrainian government to seek peace in order to get Crimea/Donetsk/Luhansk, and they're not going to just leave without that.  Russia won't be able to ""win"" until May/June (when the invasion should have happened if there was a single brain in the Russian high command) when the ground solidifies and they can execute actual mobile warfare and not be confined to moving on roads exclusively.",False,1647800239.0,t3_ticq6n,t1_i1fhuv7,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

I think people over-stress this. Belarus is a Russian puppet. The amount of economic sway that Putin holds over the Belarusian people is pretty huge and has been used to force the direction of the country towards Putin, [The Milk war is the example I usually reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_War)

Part of the reason why the west hasn't focused any serious sanctions towards Belarus is because the west is already fairly isolated from Belarus, because Belarus is a major economic partner of Russia. I think its not unreasonable to think Putin has enough economic power over Belarus to force the military brass of Belarus to do what he wants.

They are.  At least Israeli special forces and Mossad are.

I've asked on the Israel forum why Israel is trying to be more neutral.

> Washington (CNN) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that he's ""ready for negotiations"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin but warned that if they fail ""that would mean that this is a third World War.""
> 
> ""I'm ready for negotiations with him. I was ready for the last two years. And I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,"" he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria.
> 
> ""I think that we have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War,"" he added.

> Zelensky has urged more negotiations in recent days as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week. In a video message posted Saturday, he called for talks ""without delay,"" warning that otherwise Russia's losses would be ""huge.""
> 
> ""We have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace,"" he said. ""And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine.""

> Zelensky has previously said that his priorities in the talks are clear: ""The end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country.""

A lot of what is going on will start to make sense. 

I think it was Julia Ioffe who mentioned in the Putin Files interview why some older Russian women like Putin. One of the reasons is simply that he's not dead yet. The life expectancy of men in Russia is pretty low compared to other countries. There are other reasons too, such as Putin appearing to be a tough, athletic and strong leader. It's all part of his carefully crafted image. Appearing to be strong is very important. There are even songs about Putin and how desirable he is.

Putin is a dictator whose ability to rule is based on:

1 The powerful (in force and economics) assenting to his rule. 

2 The people being kept out of the streets by contentment or acceptance or fear. 

Putin has shit the bed. Billions in force projection chewed up in basically three weeks. That’s years of Russian tax dollars just turned to scrap and oh yeah by the way a lot of spending in time and money on training officers and enlisted men wasted. 

Replacing personnel is going to be hard. Officer losses are at crazy levels. 25,000 rubles and an apartment isn’t likely enough incentive for enlisting anymore and higher conscription and calling up reserves is unpopular unless the people buy into your war. 

The war is still new enough that military leadership is still in sunk cost mode thinking throw some more at it and we can fix this. Still people trying to salvage their careers and those not directly involved seeing opportunities to get rid of involved officers between them and advancement. 

Presumably there is some point where the military sees it as do something about Putin before he does something about them. 

The economically powerful at some point go into wealth preservation mode. 

An off ramp weakens Putin with both groups. It becomes you pissed our power and resources for nothing. He’s no longer a winner who is delivering. 

The information blackout buys him time with the public but eventually parents, spouses and siblings become aware their loved one isn’t coming back and meeting others realizing that about their loved one. Others know them and realize their kid is facing conscription into a black hole war. 

Their grief and anger kills the love, admiration, or respect for Putin who no longer is a successful leader making Russia a respected or feared world power and they shut the country down or close enough.

   An anti-Russian insurgency will no doubt face obstacles and endure setbacks. Putin is aware of the possibility of Ukrainian resistance to a wider Russian occupation. U.S. officials have alleged that the Russian government maintains lists of Ukrainian political and security officials it would arrest—or even assassinate—once it has seized the country and lists of pro-Kremlin figures it would hope to install. Russia would seek to undermine any insurgency by moving expeditiously to eliminate likely leaders and enablers of the resistance.     
    
   An insurgency against Russian forces in Ukraine will take time to gather steam and achieve its goals. Resistance movements can take years—not months—to mature, organize, and achieve a meaningful offensive tempo. Even as an American, I could have easily walked the streets or dined in the cafes of Kabul in 2002 and Baghdad in 2003 without a care in the world. But a year or two later, I had to wear body armor and be accompanied by a protective security detail that ferried me around in heavily armored vehicles, hoping to avoid ambushes and improvised explosive device strikes.     
     
   Ukrainian insurgents will have to reckon with advances in modern technology that make their work more difficult. During World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, organized bands of partisans could disperse to the countryside or into the hills. Escaping the reach of occupying forces is harder now thanks to drones, satellites, and thermal imagery. Insurgents will undertake cross-border raids but sustained military operations further behind enemy lines will require help from those living in such areas—people leading ostensibly normal lives who secretly have access to weapons and secure communications and can thereby evade Russian detection. The Russians will label the attacks of these operatives as acts of terrorism while people in the West will applaud them as the deeds of freedom fighters.   
   
   Early on, it is likely the Russians will uncover many rings of insurgents, quickly unmasking the insurgency’s initial leaders after years of Russian intelligence collection. But insurgencies adapt swiftly—far faster than the large, structured armies they are fighting—and new leaders emerge molded by their adverse early experiences. Their agility becomes an enormous advantage.  
   Russia would hope to either limit its incursion to parts of Ukraine whose populations might be more inclined to accept Russian rule or act with such lightning speed so as to seize and pacify the country before a viable resistance can find its legs. But Russia’s military advantages over Ukrainian forces will diminish as the enemy it fights changes from an organized army to a decentralized and mobile resistance. Occupation forces will be subject to harassing attacks designed to both inflict casualties and undermine military discipline. An influence campaign replete with horrific images of carnage—of both civilian Ukrainian and Russian military deaths—will aim to sow antiwar sentiment in Russia and counter Moscow’s narrative that their forces were welcomed as liberators by grateful locals.    
     
   Putin’s motivations in starting this war of choice remain the subject of great debate. They may become clearer in the coming days and weeks as Russia continues its offensive. But if his aims are maximalist—redrawing borders or even toppling the current government—an insurgency is inevitable. For both Putin and his enemies, it will be hard to control the forces that have now been unleashed.",False,1647798555.0,t3_ticq6n,t1_i1fgdah,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

The damaging cuts to roads and bridges in Ukraine couldn't be implemented in time as they were around Kyiv and Chernyiv.

However, that said, once these pre-positioned supplies start running low, and the supply chains start breaking down, I can see a possibility of a reversal coming.   The Russians were already running short of supplies a few days into the war, as evidenced by the attempts to move troops and supplies from other parts of Russia.

I mean this as nicely as possible, but depending on what you are trying to communicate, this is not a really a particularly meaningful statement.  The conflict has a fairly clear aggressor and defender, and is an unprovoked invasion in what appears to be a pattern of unprovoked aggression.  
  
  The idea that emotions shouldn't not play a part in the response is foolishness.  This is effectively a home invasion on a grand scale, and while emotions should not dictate the whole response, the other extreme is that if the response is detached from the outcome (i.e. appeasement prior to WWII, and before the current conflict we had Crimea and whatever hell happened in... 2008(?)) the outcome is historically not great.
  
If what you are trying to say is that emotion has somehow ""made this worse than it needed to be, or should be"", I implore you to take a flight to Ukraine to tell everyone that they shouldn't let their emotions get involved as hospitals and schools get bombed.  I don't even know what you would say talking to Russians, and the West finally getting involved is a breath of fresh air considering how little anyone seems to care about the humanity of anyone else these days.

Point 1: Partially correct but also mostly irrelevant. 

> **The ultimate fall of Mariupol is increasingly unlikely to free up enough Russian combat power to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically.** Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations. The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power. If and when Mariupol ultimately falls the Russian forces now besieging it may not be strong enough to change the course of the campaign dramatically by attacking to the west.

Point 2: Wrong.

> The Russians appear to have abandoned plans to attack Odesa at least in the near term.

Point 3: Wrong. 

> Russian forces in the south appear to be focusing on a drive toward Kryvyi Rih, presumably to isolate and then take Zaporizhiya and Dnipro from the west but are unlikely to secure any of those cities in the coming weeks if at all. Kryvyi Rih is a city of more than 600,000 and heavily fortified according to the head of its military administration. Zaporizhiya and Dnipro are also large. The Russian military has been struggling to take Mariupol, smaller than any of them, since the start of the war with more combat power than it is currently pushing toward Kryvyi Rih. The Russian advance on that axis is thus likely to bog down as all other Russian advances on major cities have done.",False,1647790012.0,t3_ticq6n,t1_i1ets47,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

 >After the invasion began on 24 February, several Russian celebrities, including pop star Valery Meladze, television host Ivan Urgant and television presenter Ksenia Sobchak, unambiguously criticized it on social media. The comedian and television presenter Maxim Galkin and television comedian Alexander Gudkov also condemned the war. Vlogger Yury Dud received a million 'likes' for a post criticising the war:  I write these words for a reason. When my children grow up and discover this moment in history.

 [Statements against the war by public figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_anti-war_protests_in_Russia#Statements_against_the_war_by_public_figures) 
 
 >After the invasion began on 24 February, several Russian celebrities, including pop star Valery Meladze, television host Ivan Urgant and television presenter Ksenia Sobchak, unambiguously criticized it on social media. The comedian and television presenter Maxim Galkin and television comedian Alexander Gudkov also condemned the war. Vlogger Yury Dud received a million 'likes' for a post criticising the war:  I write these words for a reason. When my children grow up and discover this moment in history.

Russian leadership has been fearful of capable and popular soldiers rising through the ranks, so they are either shuffled off, forced to retire or poached to other orgs like FSB. Meanwhile, outside actors from FSB, etc., who the state trust are put into higher positions, whether or not they have combat experience (though I imagine they are at least moderately competent).

In effect, this means that there's very little in the way of institutional knowledge in the ranks. Therefore, none of the grunts know how to solve problems or accomplish tasks in a practical sense. They get orders to ""go to city and take it,"" but there's no grizzled sergeant there to ""creatively interpret"" those orders to actually get things done in an efficient manner.

So things start falling apart. Maintenance gets missed. Supplies don't get delivered on time. Squads flail around the battlefield without support and get picked off.

As a result, higher officers have to take on NCO duties to get things un-screwed. Which means they need to be closer to the front. Which makes them vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes.

* Main fronts in the South, East and North East are unable to make considerable gains.
* Every passing day, the economic sanctions bite harder. New ones can be introduced. 
* The possible introduction of Belarus into the battle creates a significant increase in risk to accidentally bring NATO in this due to the proximity of supposed axis to Poland.
* The supposed mine laying in the Black Sea along the coasts of several NATO members. Again further increasing the risk of NATO intervention.

This is just the first time when we can see it unfolding in real time and in HD. This is a human problem, not Russian problem. Here's anecdata. My friend's in Russia, an ethnic Ukrainian.

Here's my hope. Now that we civilians can actually *see* what it's like in real time, maybe, just maybe, we take steps after this to ensure that this never happens again. High doubt, of course, but in Pandora's box, among all the evils, was hope as well, no?

edit: and by weaker I mean people vulnerable for whatever reason, be it average to low intelligence, or being young, or whatever. In my case it was because I was young (a teenager) and sheltered, raising myself entirely alone at an age where a kid needs guidance their most, and I was mad as hell. I was honestly both stunned and embarrassed, and grateful when I realised how patient people around me had been with me.

> While it was acknowledged bombing Germany would cause civilian casualties, the British government renounced deliberate bombing of civilian property, outside combat zones, as a military tactic. The British changed their policy on 15 May 1940, one day after the German bombing of Rotterdam, when the RAF was given permission to attack targets in the Ruhr Area, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces that at night were self-illuminating. The first RAF raid on the interior of Germany took place on the night of 15/16 May 1940 while the Battle of France was still continuing.

And in 1939:

>  Polish reports from the beginning of September note strafing of civilians by German attacks and bombing of cemeteries and marked hospitals (marking of hospitals proved counterproductive as German aircraft began to specifically target them, until hospitals were moved into the open to avoid such targeting), and indiscriminate attacks on fleeing civilians which according to Szarota was a direct violation of the Hague Convention",False,1647767379.0,t3_ticq6n,t1_i1du8kc,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

It's true that allied bombers targeted civilian areas during WW2. But it was quickly realized that ""crushing the spirit"" of a place was impossible in this way. 

What they realized though was that attacking the population centers *rapidly cleared the industrial centers of civilian workers* who fled to areas less prone to subsequent bombing. This resulted in a bombing strategy where destroying homes put massive strain on the logistical requirements of Nazi Germany to feed and house civilian populations that couldn't live within working distance of factories and transportation hubs. it also meant that when Russian soldiers marched through Eastern Germany, they didn't have large entrenched populations of conscripts to fight back in a bloody urban war. The Allied bombings were planned and executed to drive civilians away from the cities and keep them there where they couldn't contribute to the German war effort, not exterminate them.

Compare to the Nazis, who explicitly targeted civilian areas - particularly Jewish neighborhoods and other locations perceived to be full of ""untermenschen"" with the full intention and hope of killing as many civilians as possible while encircling and containing them on the ground with army forces to increase the kill count.

Most of the discussion of Allies bombing Axis civilian population centers ignores the fact that most of the controversy didn't come from conquered Axis citizens, but instead the Soviet propaganda of the Cold War which sternly pointed its finger at western Allied aggression and happily ignored that most cities targeted in eastern Europe this way were at the explicit request of Russian high command to limit the need for difficult urban warfare in their drive to Berlin.",False,1647773446.0,t3_ticq6n,t1_i1du8kc,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

> **Wang Yi: China's proposition is objective and fair, and stands on the right side of history**
> 
> Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 20 (Reporter Yue Yuanyuan) On the evening of March 19, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi was interviewed by reporters in Tunxi, Anhui Province, and introduced the exchange of views between the heads of China and the United States on the Ukraine issue via video call.
> 
> Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping has clearly and comprehensively clarified China's position on the Ukraine issue, and the most important message sent is that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace. We have always advocated maintaining peace and opposed war. This is not only rooted in China's historical and cultural traditions, but also China's consistent foreign policy. China will continue to make independent judgments based on the merits of the matter and in an objective and fair attitude. We will never accept any external coercion and pressure, and we also oppose any groundless accusations and suspicions against China.
> 
> Wang Yi emphasized that President Xi Jinping also proposed a Chinese solution to the Ukraine crisis, which mainly includes two aspects. It is imperative that all parties work together to promote dialogue and negotiation between the parties, cease fire and cease fighting as soon as possible, and avoid civilian casualties, especially to prevent humanitarian crises. The long-term solution is to abandon the Cold War mentality, refrain from engaging in group confrontation, and truly form a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture. Only in this way can long-term stability on the European continent be achieved.
> 
> Wang Yi said that China's position is objective and fair, and it is consistent with the aspirations of most countries. Time will prove that China's position is on the right side of history.

> Russia produced approximately one-third of the 2020 supply, much of it made with uranium from Kazakhstan.

> Russia also has 43% of the global enrichment capacity, followed by Europe (about 33%), China (16%) and the U.S. (7%). There is some spare capacity in the U.S. and Europe, and China is expanding.

Given that Russia is such a key-player in the supply chain for nuclear fuel (we don't have a lot of spare reactor-grade nuclear fuel laying around) the world still depends on them for this form of energy.

The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.

Most comments like these exaggerate how useless the Russian army is. However, any attempt to claim that after this war Russia still poses a threat to a strong military power is a joke. There is so much information that they have given about them for free that it's impossible not to see all their shortcomings and they are huge.

The Russian military is is no position to attempt invading a country that has a decent military defense. They are struggling to make any significant progress in invading a country that has one tenth their military, while attacking it from multiple fronts with almost 200k troops and while using the advantage of attacking from Belarus as well. Everything is stacked in their favor and all they can do is be successful in bombing civilians from a distance.

> First of all, this is not Russia going 100% all out on Ukraine..

No, its not 100%. According to Pentagon officials, Russia uses up to 75% of its permanent military land forces to this war. Even if that estimation is way off (unlikely), Russia has committed more than half of its standing army to this conflict. It's attacking Ukraine from 3 huge sides with the help of an ally that gives them access close to Ukraine's capital. And they've been trying to make progress for almost a month. The Russian army is not a joke, it's not a baby kitten but it's hardly the force many strategist feared.

Russia cannot sustain this operational tempo.  They are being ground down much faster than they are grinding down the Ukrainians.

Additionally, the Russians are going to suffer progressively worse effects from sanctions over time.  If the war lasts into 2024, Germany, Poland and Romania will be able to access alternative supplies for energy.

The only hope that Russia has of winning their operational objectives is either (1) a sudden collapse of Ukrainian resistance; or (2) converting most of their forces in to WW 1 style static entrenched units while choosing the minimum number of active fronts to focus their dwindling offensive fire power.

But option (2) turns the war into an economic and industrial lasting exercise.

 >Amanita phalloides (), commonly known as the death cap or death cup, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Widely distributed across Europe, but now sprouting in other parts of the world, A. phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe and gills.

 >Strategic bombing during World War II involved sustained aerial attacks on railways, harbours, cities, workers' and civilian housing, and industrial districts in enemy territory during World War II (1939–1945). Strategic bombing as a military strategy is distinct both from close air support of ground forces and from  tactical air power. During World War II, many military strategists of air power believed that air forces could win major victories by attacking industrial and political infrastructure, rather than purely military targets.

He married his high-school sweetheart on boot leave; she left him a year later when it turned out that a teenage wife living in base housing with no job prospects, 2,000 miles from her friends and family, and an immature dipshit husband who is constantly at work to boot isn't exactly the best foundation for marriage. The second wife was an, um, ""performer"" whom he met at Driftwood and married to get out of the barracks. The military pays you to get married, after all. They divorced after he signed a POA on deployment and she ran off with his first Camaro, his gun collection, and the (very small) amount of money in his checking account.

He hates the Marine Corps with a seething passion - the mass punishment, the fuck-fuck games, all of the time he spends waiting in line at the range, everything.

but one way or another, its unlikely there will be a steady source for new MiGs in Ukraine's future.  russia sure as hell isn't going to sell them mig29 or su27 parts.

if they have pilots to spare (or candidates), it makes sense to start getting the used to the types of planes they're likely to be flying in 1-10 years. 

the f16 is probably the best example... the go-to inexpensive western fighter, and one which the US may have excess stocks of as the f35 comes online.  lot of countries getting rid of their old non-superhornet f-18s too (canada, australia).  also f-5s (aka t38) seem to be popular, easy to pick up and offer pretty decent capability for the price.  don't really keep up with french jets but i'm sure dassault has something.

The real power is the security apparatus - the KGB previously and now the FSB. The security apparatus prevents the conventional military from becoming powerful enough to challenge their stranglehold on power. It does this by removing competent leadership and appointing easily corruptible yet loyal cronies to positions of control. that's why the current head of the Russian National Guard is a former steelworker turned personal bodyguard for Yeltsin and Putin instead of a veteran soldier or officer. In Russia it's not hyperbole to say that organized crime members who've sworn to support Putin are held in higher regard by the state than members of the conventional armed forces. In fact many such criminals who are sentenced to prison in Russia (including penal conscripts in the military) are then recruited by their captors to spy on other prisoners who might resent the government for their situation.

So the military was intentionally kept staffed by loyalist embezzlers and thieves, but the question mark then is if the nuclear forces are similarly affected or if the security bureau runs them properly, because it knows the military is just for show. This hypersonic missile they claim to have was specifically designed to deliver nuclear warheads, so we at least know there's an effort to keep them relevant.

•	⁠ad hominem: who are you and what are your credentials? Are you an expert? Are you fighting in Ukraine right now?

•	⁠attacking your virtues: where was this level of support for the refugees of conflict x? You are the one picking a fight and will start world war iii if you keep it up!
•	⁠diminishing actions: wow what a useless gesture. More sanctions. Yawn. Oh another un vote. How effective. Not!

Its analyses are frankly pretty basic observations of where the west's problems and political ""weak spots"" are and how they can be exploited to sow increasing discord. Anyone trying to do so would do many things that are mentioned by Dugin without that being ""*the* playbook"".

What's more, though - MAD is the **only** thing keeping Russia's terriotorial integrity ""safe"" - even before strategic nuclear weapons, they **cannot** afford to not follow through with escalation if directly attacked, just like NATO couldn't afford to not escalate an attack on a member according to article 5. The first downed plane or rocket into Russia likely won't lead to immediate launch of ICBMs  - but the escalation in that direction is absolutely guaranteed.

And again - betting on a country not following through with the only threat keeping it from being overrun is just a bad idea.

By your logic, Putin might say the same - ""the US playbook doesn't end with them all dead - nobody benefits... so surely if I launch one in mere retaliation for an attack by them, they won't launch in return - they're not callous enough"". It's not a good argument, and the foundation for the belief that Russia would not escalate is contrary to the way military deterrence has worked since forever. 

It also neglects inertia and the self-catalyzing dynamics of conflict escalation. From the first limited use
of tactical nukes - which I have *absolutely* no doubt Putin would do if someone invaded Russia (not sure he won't light up one somewhere out to sea as a warning that he really means business if this drags on) - to full scale thermonuclear war is a very short distance, easily bridged by inertia and self-catalyzing conflict escalation.

Because when they do fear being overrun, the calculus becomes ""we don't follow through, are toast now and forever everyone's bitch - or we follow through and either we're all toast or it works and they back off"", whence the latter becomes the better option. So you follow through and do a (perhaps limited) escalation - but then the same calculus applies to the other side. Game-theory becomes pretty fucked-up at that scale. It's a nuclear prisoner's dilemma - and since the negative payoff of non-cooperation is apocalyptic in this case, this is something we have a pretty absolute duty to prevent.

Yemen has not invited help from other nations in the same way. That makes it extraordinarily difficult for an American citizen to connect. It also makes it difficult to contribute to charities that might benefit civilians since those charities are channeled through governmental authority.

I have been aware of 'blood for oil' as a concept for a lifetime and I have solar panels, Tesla batteries and an electric car.

Not going to accuse you of 'whataboutism' but I do think there are some false equivalencies here. I don't 'not care' about children in Yemen. I'm helpless to get support to them directly. It isn't about race but it is about the ability to communicate. It is difficult for me to feel Yemen respects the rights of women. I don't have that conflict with Ukraine. I understand that they are oppressed and I don't want them to suffer any more than I want North Koreans to suffer. I don't want ANYBODY to suffer, but if I feel as though the Yemeni government would be happy if I personally were suffering, it's difficult to feel as though we are on the same side. If I respect the sovereignty of nations, and I do, all I can ask is that my government not support the conflict, and Biden did that.

It certainly wasn't because Germany held back, or at least they stopped that after their initial bombing expeditions were torn apart by British air defenses. Germany intentionally carried out such bombing campaigns in Poland, Hungary, Denmark, and elsewhere in eastern Europe before and during Operation Barbarossa leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Their pilots carried maps that didn't just point out specific factories, but also highlighted large civilian housing neighborhoods that were targeted for extermination not just by air power, but as a concentrated focus of all Weremacht and Nazi forces.
