The last couple of days were somewhat quiet, there were no missile strikes aimed directly at Kharkiv, but there were plenty of those aimed at other towns in Kharkiv oblast. In the most recent strike, they hit Chuhuiv with multiple S-300 missiles launched from Belgorod, and as usual they were targeting civilians. Private houses and civilian cars were damaged in the attack, sadly they also managed to kill 3 civilians.

These constant strikes targeting civilians make my blood boil, and then you almost always see people (not even Russians) trying to justify them. The bastards targeted a popular pizzeria in Kramatorsk and said that it was full of “soldiers and their instructors” while the people who died were exclusively civilian, including 3 kids and multiple pizzeria workers. And no, it wasn’t hit because their weapons are inaccurate, they knew that it was a place frequented by volunteers and journalists so they targeted it directly. 

I don’t usually worry ZNPP being blown up, after all there’s nothing that we can really do about it either way, but today Russian MFA accused us of “preparing terrorist act at the nuclear plant”. Basically, they are saying that we are going to blow it up, and as we already know, Russian accusations are their confessions. They accused us of planning to blow up the Kakhovka dam before doing it themselves. Coupled with them reducing their personnel on the ZNPP at the same time with this accusation, it actually starts looking like a very real threat. Hopefully it doesn’t happen, but since we are dealing with the Russians here, the worst outcome should be expected.",False,1688137996.0,t3_14mpqrq,t3_14mpqrq,,0,264,0,264,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

>
>For Ukraine’s counteroffensive to progress faster, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the top officer in Ukraine’s armed forces, says he needs more — of every weapon. And he is telling anyone who will listen, including his American counterpart Gen. Mark A. Milley as recently as Wednesday, that he needs those resources now.
>
>In a rare, wide-ranging interview with The Washington Post, Zaluzhny expressed frustration that while his biggest Western backers would never launch an offensive without air superiority, Ukraine still has not received modern fighter jets but is expected to rapidly take back territory from the occupying Russians. American-made F-16s, promised only recently, are not likely to arrive until the fall — in a best-case scenario.
>
>His troops also should be firing at least as many artillery shells as their enemy, Zaluzhny said, but have been outshot tenfold at times because of limited resources.
>
>So it “pisses me off,” Zaluzhny said, when he hears that Ukraine’s long-awaited counteroffensive in the country’s east and south has started slower than expected — an opinion publicly expressed by Western officials and military analysts and also by President Volodymyr Zelensky, though Zaluzhny was not referring to Zelensky. His troops have gained some ground — even if it’s just 500 meters — every day, he said.
>
>“This is not a show,” Zaluzhny said Wednesday in his office at Ukraine’s General Staff headquarters. “It's not a show the whole world is watching and betting on or anything. Every day, every meter is given by blood.”
>
>“Without being fully supplied, these plans are not feasible at all,” he added. “But they are being carried out. Yes, maybe not as fast as the participants in the show, the observers, would like, but that is their problem.”
>
>…
>
>In these conversations, Zaluzhny is frank about the consequences: “We have an agreement: 24/7, we’re in touch. So, sometimes I can call up and say, ‘If I don’t get 100,000 shells in a week, 1,000 people will die. Step into my shoes,’” he said.
>
>But “it’s not Milley who decides whether we get planes or not,” Zaluzhny said. “It’s just that while that decision is being made, in the obvious situation, a lot of people die every day — a lot. Just because no decision has been made yet.”

For too long, NATO's policy toward Ukraine has been determined by the fear of provoking Russia, but recent events have shown that concessions, not force, provoke Russian aggression.

Ukraine has proven to be a valuable asset to the Alliance, participating in major operations and delivering emergency cargo during the pandemic.

 It is time to stop treating Ukraine as a burden and fulfill the promise of NATO membership that was made in 2008.

There are fears that inviting Ukraine to join NATO will lead to an immediate conflict with Russia, but this is a mistake.  NATO has previously accepted countries with occupied territories, for example, Germany.

Ukraine has already implemented more NATO standards than some current members, and its soldiers have demonstrated proficiency with weapons on the battlefield.

Support for NATO is high among Ukrainians, and polls show that citizens of NATO countries are more favorable to Ukraine's invitation than leaders may think.

By leaving Ukraine aside, we risk prolonging the conflict and giving Russia the right to veto the bloc's expansion.

>
>[The attack killed] at least 12 people [and wounded] 60. Three children were among the dead, including two twin 14-year-old girls.
>
>Among the people severely wounded in this crime is our dearest colleague Victoria Amelina: a brilliant award-winning, worldwide-known Ukrainian writer and human rights activist who spent her time since the beginning of the full-scale invasion documenting war crimes, working with children on frontline territories…
>
>The Russians knew the Ria Lounge restaurant is a rare and popular place in the frontline city of Kramatorsk where people get together to talk and have their meals. They knew the strike would have many victims — but they targeted this crowd, as they have numerous times during this war, and during their previous wars. 
>
>They did so previously in Kherson on December 24th, 2022, when they targeted a market full of people shopping, killing 10 people and wounding more than 60. They did so in the same Kramatorsk on April 8th, 2022, when they sent a missile to a crowd of people waiting for an evacuation train in a railway station, killing at least 61, and leaving over a hundred people wounded. They did so a year ago, by attacking a trade mall in Kremenchuk killing at least 20 people. They did so on March 9th, 2022, when they dropped massive bombs on two 5-story buildings in Izyum, killing dozens of people in each of the houses, even though they were hiding in the basements. They blew up the Nova Kakhovka dam on June 6th, 2023, causing a huge increase in water levels and the deaths of many people by drowning. The disastrous environmental consequences of this act will persist for many decades. The list of these crimes can go on and on. The shelling of the Kramatorsk Ria Lounge is another crime in this chain, and another evidence of the way Russians wage their wars.
>
>Truth Hounds has interviewed eyewitnesses of the attack who testified that there were no military objects that could have been a legal target for the attack around that day. Also, they confirmed that it was a regular day in one of the most popular restaurants in the city: up to 40 people, divided into small companies, were having dinner. Truth Hounds investigators identified that the foreigners, whom Russian propaganda called mercenaries, actually were volunteers and journalists.
>
>In our opinion, the attack on the Ria Lounge restaurant may qualify as a war crime pursuant to Article 8(2)(b)(ii) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Alternatively, such an attack may be qualified under Article 8(2)(b)(i) or Article 8(2)(b)(iv) of the Rome Statute of the ICC.
>
>Russia has proven once again that it does not care about civilians or international law. Every day this aggressor country continues to attack civilians in Ukraine. There are so many other stories, every day, every night, stories of people whose lives end, who will have no tomorrow, who will never respond.
>
>Victims await justice. Prisons await criminals.  
>
>It is not only about Ukrainians. It is about all humans and our values.

Many thought last year’s record $1.25 trillion ruble windfall tax on Gazprom and certain other Russian state owned businesses was a one-time occurrence, but Putin has only doubled down and ordered more windfall taxes in the months since, raising trillions of rubles more from companies and oligarchs alike. Likewise, first Putin resorted to levying onerous taxes on both companies and people leaving Russia after the invasion before he dropped all pretense and just started indiscriminately seizing money and property instead.

> Similarly, Putin has abandoned all pretense of responsible fiscal policy, running record budget deficits, printing record amounts of money out of thin air, forcing Russian banks and individuals to buy near-worthless Russian debt, and drawing down Russia’s hundreds of billions in sovereign wealth funds, mortgaging away Russia’s future.

[Time](https://time.com/6291642/putin-cannibalizes-russian-economy/)

Big wars are expensive and without the ability to generate meaningful profits from the export of Russian energy or raw materials the Kremlin has been forced to turn to massive tax hikes and seizing property directly. High taxes may be understandable if that money is being spent on investment in a nation’s people or infrastructure but that’s not the case with Russia. They are taxing the hell out of all economic activity only to spend it on weapons and equipment that gets blown up in a war. High taxes, deficit spending and endless money printing are not what strong economies are based on.

- A major accident is unlikely because the ZNPP is not operating at power.

- This quote says enough: Contrary to popular belief, this [a direct strike impact] will not cause a nuclear explosion. The reactor is not an nuclear bomb, even if at the time of the accident it is operating at full capacity. There was no nuclear explosion either at Chernobyl or at Fukushima. Even if a strike on a reactor operating at power should damage the control rods (which in the VVER-1000 are located in the upper part of the reactor, which would most likely suffer in the event of an impact) and somehow cause a reactor runaway,then it would sooner fall apart and depressurize than it would release a large amount of energy as the result of an uncontrolled chain reaction. Most likely it would simply depressurize with a release of water, steam and possibly the fuel itself, and the nuclear reaction would be extinguished on its own.

- Because the ZNPP has been in shutdown for so long, its reactors have not been producing one of the most dangerous radioactive elements to humans: iodine-131. Additionally, the iodine-131 that was within the reactor has decayed, significantly reducing the amount of this isotope that could be release during an accident/incident. Thus any accident/incident involving radiation release will likely impact a far smaller area with iodine pollution. In addition, iodine relatively quickly dissipates, with a half-life (50% of the material gone thanks to the nature of radioactive material) of 8 days. It stays a potential health hazard for a couple of weeks at most.

- This quote: ...outside the southeastern part of Ukraine, the probability of receiving a dose of more than 2.5 mSv is below 0.1. 2.5 mSv (millisievert) is about a quarter of the dose of a regular CT scan and far from a lethal dose of radiation.

- Even in what the report calls a 'conservative overestimate' scenario, the release of radioactive matieral (particularly the isotope cesium-137) would not significantly impact any area outside of Ukraine. Any release would be similar to already existing 'background radiation' that we experience on a daily basis.

- Any release of radioactive material would likely be in a short, one-time burst, which further limits the spread of radioactive material (Chornobyl was a week-long release of materials).

- The primary area affected outside of Ukraine, even if it is very likely extremely minor, would be Southeastern Europe, Belarus and European Russia at most.

- In the most dangerous scenario, a meltdown due to power loss/cooling loss, there will most likely not be an explosion. Accumulated hydrogen, the main culprit of the Fukushima explosion (also a meltdown), and formed by the reaction of zirconium nuclear fuel cladding with water vapor, cannot accumulate in dangerous quantities at ZNPP. There are devices in place that combine excess hydrogen back into water. These devices do not need electricity and can operate even when the ZNPP has been completely disconnected. The likely outcome of such an scenario is ground/water pollution at the site, or at most in the Dnieper basin, whose scale is likely to be relatively small because the reactors do not operate at power.

- Such a worst-case scenario is unlikely to develop without personnel knowing about it. With ZNPP not operating at power, a meltdown scenatio won't develop over in a matter of hours - it will take several days to come to that.

- Spent fuel does not explode. It will only cause local ground contamination if hit (unlikely).

- The cladding of the ZNPP's reactor buildings is strong and won't easily be breached by explosives. It can withstand the impact of a direct hit by an airplane weighing 6 metric tons. By comparison, the Chornobyl plant did not have a proper containment building like the ZNPP has.",False,1688122546.0,t3_14mpqrq,t3_14mpqrq,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

Russian siloviki-focused channel publishes document, says it explains  “why questions arose regarding Surovikin in connection with the rebellion.”  Basically, the document told of the plan.

> According to the source, Andrey Troshev, a representative of Wagner, notified the leadership of the Ministry of Defense in advance of the planned movement of Wagner forces and it’s assets *across Russia*—to be moved to storage facilities, transfering en masse from June 21 to July 5. 

> Actually, he said that Wagner would ""withdraw"" from the war. [Remember, that deadline was looming so this was a probable outcome.] Further, that Sergei Surovikin would act as a guarantor of preventing any provocations from Wagner. 

> However, later Shoigu was informed that the movement of Wagner forces was actually planned for a different reason—in order to capture Shoigu and Gerasimov. The source says that Shoigu believed that characterization of the true purpose of the transfer of Wagner equipment. 

> Recently, Surovikin had been prevented from seeing Putin, and even his reports were filtered either through Gerasimov or through ‘dummy unit commanders from the front.’ 

> Realizing that earlier attempts to remove Shoigu and Gerasimov with the help of Prigozhin publicly discrediting them hadn’t been successful, it was decided to use the possibility of transferring Wagner forces and means to actually physically capture Shoigu and Gerasimov, and then report to Putin about the ‘true state of affairs.’

> Having learned about theses conspirators’ intentions, Shoigu reported to Putin that a coup d'état was being prepared—but said the purpose of which is to overthrow *Putin*, and second, in order to prevent this, a preemptive strike against them was needed. 

> Subsequently, it was also decided to isolate the various conspirators from the rest of the generals—but without disclosing the conspirators’ involvement in the rebellion—in order to avoid uncontrolled spiraling  among military personnel at the front—as Surovikin has much greater authority amongst frontline commanders than either Gerasimov or Shoigu has.

5f39b0e4ab16d52347f4662dee29165d,14mpqrq,jq5445c,"Okay, Russian and Ukrainian pronunciation guide again:

First of all, just quickly explaining the Kyiv vs Kiev thing again. Russian, Ukrainian, and, because it's going to come up, Belarusian are three different languages all descended from Old East Slavic. So think something like Spanish vs Portuguese for level of similarity or difference. And the Ukrainian capital is one of those cities that's been around for so long that it has proper translations of its name in local languages, similarly to how it's Firenze in Italian, but Florence in English, both from Florentia in Latin. So Kiev is correct when speaking Russian (and, yes, even the Ukrainian government will use it in that context), Kyiv is correct when speaking Ukrainian, and Kiew is correct when speaking Belarusian. The actual change is that, historically, we've borrowed names from Russian as the dominant local language and culture, but since independence, Ukraine's asked that we borrow the Ukrainian names instead. For example, Chornobyl and Kyiv, not Chernobyl and Kiev. This *does* have an impact on pronunciation in the Cyrillic alphabet, since there are a few letters like и, щ, and г that are pronounced differently between the three languages. (If you learned that щ is shch, that's still true for Ukrainian, but it's shifted to a longer sh in Russian) But because that all gets leveled out in transliteration, like how the sound change g > h from Old East Slavic to Ukrainian is reflected by transliterating г as h instead of g, I'm going to gloss over that part. This is focused more on pronouncing transliterated names, like you'll see used in English.

**Vowels**

For the most part, think Spanish / Not-English. So it's AH, EY, EE, OH, OO. Technically, E and O are slightly more open like in b**e**t and b**ough**t, but ""Like Spanish"" is good enough for a lot of things

Y is normally a vowel, although before another vowel, it's probably a consonant. As a vowel, though, it makes a sound fairly similar to the I in b**i**t. (And this is one of those spelling differences in Cyrillic. Russian and Ukrainian both have I and Y as vowels, but while Russian has и vs ы, Ukrainian has і vs и)

The big *exception* is that I is, roughly speaking, silent before other vowels. (But not I. At least in Ukrainian, ii is eeyee) There are really complicated reasons this is the case, but all you really need to know is that Zaporizhzhia is 4 syllables, Za-po-rizh-zhia, not 5, Za-po-rizh-zhi-a

**Consonants**

For the most part, consonants behave how you'd expect. For example, SH makes the SH sound. There are really only five big tricky ones to watch out for:

* G- Always hard like in ""gift"", never soft like in ""giraffe""

* ZH- I never really know how common this term is, but the ZH sound is another name for the sound in plea**s**ure*. Or, if you speak French, it's just the French J sound. E.g. Zaporizhzhia

* CH- Always like in **ch**ur**ch**, never like in Ba**ch**. E.g. Chornobyl

* KH- This is how they *actually* spell the sound from Ba**ch**. E.g. Kherson

* SHSH, ZHZH, etc- Technically held for longer, but no one's going to come after you if you don't

**Stress**

Alas, Russian and Ukrainian don't have predictable stress, like how nearly every Polish word is stressed on the second to last syllable. You're going to have to look this up

**Final Obstruent Devoicing**

Not a thing in Ukrainian! It's actually one of the only two Slavic languages alongside Croatian to not have it. (It's the thing where -ov is -off in Russian)

**That weird double YY**

In more precise transcriptions, the letter й, which makes the consonant Y sound, is written J. But because that would confuse English speakers, it's confusingly written Y instead. Hence, things like Zelenskyy.

**-ov and -ev names**

At least in Russian, -ov is always -off, while for complicated reasons, -ev can either be -off or -eff. For example, Gorbachev is pronounced Gorbachoff, but Brezhnev is pronounced Brezhneff. Peeking back into Cyrillic, the rule is more precisely that -ов is pronounced -off and transliterated -ov, -ев is pronounced -eff and transliterated -ev, and -ёв is pronounced -off, but will variably be transliterated as either -ev or -ov. (Which is why you'll see both Gorbachev and Gorbachov for Горбачёв)

**V in Ukrainian**

If you want to get really fancy, the letter в in Ukrainian, transliterated V, actually makes a W sound at the end of a word or before a consonant. Unfortunately, a lot of the diphthongs that get formed, like /iw/, aren't really part of English. But pronouncing the cluster ""iv"" as ""you"" /ju/ is a decent approximation. So for example, Kharkiv is slightly closer to HARK-you

**Luka's name**

Russian and Belarusian both have a feature where A and O merge to ""uh"" in unstressed syllables. They just disagree on how to spell it. Russian spells it Lukashenko, while Belarusian spells it Lukashenka. The more you know...",1688162108.0,1688139184.0,t3_14mpqrq,t3_14mpqrq,,0,105,0,105,0,0,

The Ministry of defence have announced this morning that troops are entrenched at Ocheretuvate in the tokmak direction.  Generally such announcements in the past have come after the area is secured

Ocheretuvate is the second line of defense and there isn't really much behind that.  [https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rRKs40IEbGRsV0Fhky25l5OkPJ\_vUvQ&ll=47.22594915955095%2C35.71200405281087&z=9](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rRKs40IEbGRsV0Fhky25l5OkPJ_vUvQ&ll=47.22594915955095%2C35.71200405281087&z=9)

Also, look at a topographical map of the area - [https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-wmv51/Ukraine/?center=47.07461%2C36.03313&zoom=9](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-wmv51/Ukraine/?center=47.07461%2C36.03313&zoom=9) .  Ukraine now control the high ground above Tokmak at Ocheretuvate, with a nice defensible water feature in the village itself. EDIT(even if they haven't made it into the village itself it looks like they have entrenched themselves on the hill above it)

They will be standing up there with a clear field of view  down the Molochna river valley to Myrne ( the hill just above Ocheretuvate is about 200 meters above sea level, Myrne around 45kms away at around 10 - 60  m above sea level so should be visible at that height on a clear day.)

Whether they can get artillery there to exploit this position is another question, but

There has been a possible breakthrough on the Zaporizhiyhe front. Finally. I have been waiting for it for a while. It is a few kilometres east of Orikhiv, directly southwards. Unconfirmed as of yet.  
  
It seems I was right about the Wagner mutiny not doing much to damage Russia. From the Washington Post:  
  
""If anyone thinks that Ukraine’s counteroffensive got a lucky boost last weekend when Wagner chief Yevgeniy Prigozhin led a mutiny of mercenary forces on an assault toward Moscow before halting the advance, Zaluzhny is not so sure. Prigozhin’s Wagner forces had already exited the front line, after claiming the eastern city of Bakhmut a month ago, Zaluzhny said, so there was no noticeable change on the battlefield as the rebellion took place.  
  
“We didn't feel that their defense got weaker somewhere or anything,” he said.""  
  
Nonetheless I am still pretty confident about Ukraine's chances in the battle. They have difficulties, but advantages too. Namely the skill of their assault infantry, the use of drones and precision weapons like HIMARS, not to mention the Western vehicles. The main phase is either just beginning or has yet to begin. Tomorrow could be interesting.  
  
I had no real thoughts about Prigozhin at first, but now I am starting to realise that it might have been Lukashenko's plan to get Wagner into his country, and shore up his regime while padding it against Russia. Deep in his heart I think Luka still secretly wants to be the head of both Russia and Belarus, and that assembling dissidents inside Belarus is one strategy to get there.  
  
Interestingly, I also read that Svitlana Tsikhanouskaya and her democratic movement were preparing an uprising in Belarus in conjunction with the Belarussian units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but that it was frustrated due to the ceasefire agreement. I have long thought that once the main war is over, the democratic opposition will try to make a move to enter Belarus and take over the country. Luka probably knows this and Wagner might help him at home too in a quid pro quo. But I think little will save him once Russia is gone and out of the picture.",False,1688127032.0,t3_14mpqrq,t3_14mpqrq,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

What Ukraine needs to do is keep Russia from ossifying the front lines because that's how Russia will eventually ""annex"" the land. If Ukraine can chip away .001 percent here, .001 percent there, they are keeping the line from ossifying and that's how they can slowly grind Russia down.

If Ukraine chucks thousands upon thousands of troops into a meat grinder, eventually it will break their spirit. Ukraine needs to advance carefully and the square kilometers gained right now aren't important. What is important is breaking Russia's will, and that means killing many more of them than you lose.

Ukraine are severely struggling with command, control and communication not to mention logistics.

It has taken western nations, UK, France, USA literally hundreds of years of institutional knowledge to train staff to be able to properly plan and execute the hideously complicated operations Ukraine are trying to perform. Ukraine simply don't have enough senior leadership experience like NATO do and won't have until long after the war. 

For example a US Battalion which is approximately 800 - 1000 soldiers will have around 20 command staff who're in charge of planning operations. In order to get those 20 command staff they normally have *10 years* of military experience.  And this is just *one* Battalion. 

Ukraine are operating in the region of 3/4 field armies of 50,000 soldiers. That requires a command staff in the thousands all of which will have at least 5 years+ of experience gained by training and exercises in the most prestigious military academies on the planet.

The most recent statements were specifically regarding the benefits payouts to Wagners widows from this current campaign in Ukraine, and the funding for supply of weapons and equipment in Ukraine.  Which yes, he’s saying there that that is given by MOD.  But this was not always the case, and in fact, was one of the reasons why Wagner was not initially in Ukraine!  They were not there until after withdrew from the Kyiv direction.  There were several disagreements, all to do with funding, the biggest was the one was over the primacy of in-country contracts by their domestic arms producers.  The MOD didn’t want to compete with a PMC for supplies and ammunition, the PMC then got a lucrative contract if it would agree to get ammo from MOD.

And more importantly, this is not a video game where you have $$, push a button, wait a few seconds and your new shiny tanks rolls out. There are many inner workings to the logistics needed to produce  armored vehicles, tanks and flying stuff.
Also, most of the newer russian tanks are not brand new but rebuilt, modernized or just reconditioned mothballed tanks.

So an ""expensive"" tank might be easier to put in action than a theoreticelly cheaper one. Indeed, this is until the useful mothballed stocks last but who knows how many of the reported 10000 or so mothballed tanks can be reused.

Same goes for the western weapons, AA etc. A ""simple"" Stinger might be hard to find since it is out of production, same with Nlaws. On the other hand, maybe an AMRAAM may be easier to source.

Losing an expensive piece of equipment is not an instant hit on the country's treasury, you cannot count just money. Russia fired thousands of guided missiles.

That means in $10 billion you can fit 10,000 IVF or 3000 tanks. If you look at the total hardware losses, so far, that probably comes out to several tens of billions of dollars. Russia's total defense spending in the run-up to the war has been around $60 billion USD, and of course much higher now.

The US doesn't want to play all its cards up front, because, if it works: Russia's conventional military is obliterated completely. Now you have a state whose only remaining offensive *or* defensive weapon is nuclear. That creates a lot of dangerous scenarios, whether the war continues or ends. Then there's the worst case scenario: all that kit still isn't enough to kick Russia out of Ukraine, maybe some of it ends up in their hands, and the collective West doesn't have any more ways to press Russia militarily or diplomatically outside of committing their own forces to the conflict.

The strategy they've chosen (for better or worse) is to instead slowly turn up the heat, so that every month the war continues, Russia is forced to understand that it will only get worse. Their priorities might change suddenly if Russia were to start making significant advances, or if they introduced a new weapon that proved effective, but for now the goal is to slowly increase pressure and get maximal effect out of minimal expenditure. 

Because of this political focus, an important part of the process is constantly *signaling* to Russia that things will get worse; there's no benefit to deploying a secret weapon, because the destruction of the Russian army through surprise isn't actually the goal. The goal is to convince them to leave without even using those weapons.

This might be bullshit.  Not that Ukraine isn't asking for the Rockeyes, but consider a few of things:

Cluster munitions don't really seem suitable for Ukraine.  The United States has, for the most part, abandoned their use because precision munitions can accomplish much the same objectives while not leaving 1% of their bomblets unexploded for some civilian to step on years from now.  If the US, fielding an expeditionary force that never fights on US territory proper, is eschewing the use of cluster munitions, how much appetite would Ukraine, fighting on their own soil have?  After the way, they do plan on **living** there, right?

Even if Ukraine's interest is genuine and this isn't just injecting noise into Russia's signal, actually delivering the munition to the target might be problematic.  Drones are survivable because they're small and fly low.  To get the kind of spread on those cluster munitions the drone might be forced to fly at a higher altitude than the operator might want to, exposing it to more AA.

Finally, putting a Rockeye on a drone defeats the purpose of the drone.  You use drones not because they're *good* but because they're *cheap*, and disposable.  Each of those bombs cost $14,000 apiece.  Drone ain't so cheap no more.  On the other hand, the United States isn't using those things any more, despite having them in their arsenal.  Might be the US decides the marginal value of weapons that are going to sit in a warehouse until they expire to be *negative*, owing to the cost of storage & decommissioning.

I doubt Gerasimov had any interest in actually trying to shoot down any American aircraft for obvious reasons.

Even if they managed to take out a couple of American aircraft with the s300 system and su-34s, their destruction was inevitable with the type of American military assets in the area.

I’d guess either:

A. Prigozhin underestimated Uncle Sam’s willingness to fight

Or

B. Prigozhin underestimated Uncle Sam’s military power

I'm sure Ukraine do have command and control  issues due to the urgent and fairly ad hoc way they've had to expand and equip  their military. But on other hand after one more year they have far far more real world experience fighting in a high intensity conflict against a technologically advanced enemy than any army in the world. And so far they have won every major campaign in this war. They are hugely outperforming any realistic expectation.

A well trained, experienced american commander's response to the situation Ukraine are currently facing would be something like.
1. Don't advance until they have achieved overwhelming air superiority.
3. Use enormous of stocks of missiles, area effect munitions, waves of close air support to obliterate defensive positions, neutralise any threats to armor and psychologically destroy defenders.
4. Clear mine fields with engineers supported and protected by ground and air assets
5. Advance in force.

They'd do it methodically, carefully and with about 20x times the armored force Ukraine is using, literally thousands of sorties by F35s, F15Es and apaches, and expend billions of dollars worth of JDAMs, tomahawks and ATACMs before going anywhere near the main russian defensive line. Due to their desire to avoid casualties and the time it takes reduce defences through bombardment I actually doubt the US military would have advanced much further against the heavily defended areas of the russian lines after a month- they would still be absolutely bombing the shit out of them in a similar way to the preliminary phases of operation desert storm.

 Ukraine on the other hand has none of those options open. They are advancing with what they have and largely relying on the tactical superiority and bravery of their infantry to clear russian positions and open up corridors for armor. They are doing- with the lives and blood of their soldiers- what an american commander would do with a few billion dollars worth of precision guided munitions. 

Given the limitations in equipment they have, it is absurd to expect them to be pulling off some sort of lightning advance whilst avoiding heavy casualties- when you consider how this war started and how most people thought it would unfold, it is one of the most extraordinary achievements in military history that they are in a position to be advancing at all.

I can understand why Zaluzhny has lost patience with western commentators- he's being asked to perform an incredible difficult task with the limited resources he has. If he goes faster more ukrainians die. To both be asked to accept risks and casualties that no western army would ever accept and then have to listen to idiots complain its not being done faster is a bit much.

Its taken the US government and military 18 months (and counting) to supply 1 Abrams battle tank to Ukraine. It will take a solid 2 years for them to supply 1 modern fighter plane to Ukraine. That being the case I'm willing to allow the Ukrainian military a bit more than 1 month to take heavily defended positions with the men and equipment they do have.",False,1688183246.0,t3_14mpqrq,t1_jq7ldcq,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

I would guess the Shadow Storm has already done a lot of that. The ATACMS are not as important right now as most think they are.

Ukraine can get through the trenches, it is the land mines that are stopping Ukraine currently. The US had problems with this during the Vietnam war. The US started using a method of getting through land mines called a Thunder Run. The US would send tanks forward until they hit something. I believe from the early pictures of some of the Leopard mine clearing tanks that was damaged was being used for something like the Thunder Run but even the mine clearing tanks of the Leopard can't take the mine hits. 

So far Ukraine has only reported 1 loss of a Leopard that I know of. So I'm guessing most was able to be fixed. Ukraine stopped using this method so I guess Ukraine decided the losses would be so great by doing this that it wasn't worth it. 

The line clearing charges are working but it is slow. Once Ukraine gets close enough to Russia's main trenches I'm guessing they will revert to this method and just take the losses of equipment to punch through.

Those trenches will not be that difficult to clear. They are built with large bunkers in the ground but if you pound it with an excessive amount of mortars and HIMARS for 30mins to an hour then everyone is gonna be in those bunkers. You hit the bunkers with JDAMS and that is when you go with your big push of mine clearing tanks and push up with tanks to secure the trenches.

Slavic languages have kept or even expanded the original declension rules and the added context on each word provided by the declension makes the structure of a sentence much less rigid,  even the word order can be shuffled around without changing the original meaning (or it just adds a slight nuance or a double meaning).

Keep in mind that Russia still does have a lot of imports going on and the currency being used has an impact on how much things cost in Russia.

If a phone used to cost 45K rubles before the war, today it will cost more than 53K for the same price tag in the US. Indirect import also make things worse because it's more complicated to import things nowadays.

The reverse is also true, if you had a house worth 6M rubles before the war, you could buy a house in the US for 80K USD, but now you'd only get 67K USD out of it. 

In general, Russians are getting poorer by the day which also means that life will get more expensive tomorrow.

The reality is that while Russia could prop the ruble for about a year, it isn't able to maintain this unrealistic 1 USD to 75 RUB exchange rate (pre-war).

Russia has been burning through its reserve to make it look like everything is fine and keeping the price low for people. But over the last couple of months, the ruble has been constantly dropping slowly. They are visibly not able to prop it as much as they want anymore.

Think of it like you're burning through your reserve in a non sustainable way.. so to make it more sustainable you have to lower the ruble at the expense of your citizen. They'll get poorer by the day but if you make them poorer slowly enough, they might not even realize how bad it is because everything won't loose 50% of its value overnight.

So no, the value of the ruble is very relevant because it shows how life is getting more expensive in Russia and how Russia is unable to prop it anymore.

Edit:

But then the worse problem of all, is that at some point... Good luck finding anyone to exchange rubles for a foreign currency. So imagine that at some point, they'll have to buy stuff exclusively in foreign currencies... If you don't earn money in foreign currency and nobody want to trade your rubles...

When people were saying that the value of the Ruble doesn't mean anything, what they meant is that Russia went out of its way to put up serious capital controls and other measures, so as to prop up the value of the Ruble. Thus, this meddling made the value of the Ruble a much worse measure of overall economic welfare in Russia. 

However, since clearly Russia wasn't doing this to keep the value of the Ruble down, the value of the Ruble became a flawed measure of the success Russia was having in propping up the value of the Ruble. Ruble to USD going up means either that the Russian state was having less success in keeping the value of the Ruble high, or that the natural price of the Ruble went down without the Russian state compensating for it with stronger propping up, or both.

Yeah, sure thing, but probably not. And compared to Switzerland, they are at least not smug about it.  But it's not really the case that they became neutral by choice. It was forced upon them by the Soviets and the US post-WW2. And once something is part of the constitution, it's very difficult to get rid of it. And well during the Cold War they were neutral while bordering a Warsaw Pact country, so it's not really the case that their neutrality relied on the strength of other countries. By now it's part of their political culture, and even if they wanted to change that again it's very difficult, to get rid of principles written in the constitution, in most democracies there usually is a 2/3 majority necessary for that, and it's rarely happening anywhere.

Medvedev might well continue the war, but anyone smarter would realize that the war is unwinnable at this point, and their best move would actually be to blame Putin for the entire mess and move on.  If they keep trying to throw more at the war, they are likely to be the next to get replaced.

But here we are and even that seems unlikely now.

You do realize that it took multiple months for Kherson to be broken into right? They don't have air superiority. What they are doing right now is grinding through all the russian BTG's/regiments/whatever so they don't have reserves to call upon. And when most have been rendered combat ineffective is when the lines will actually break. The Russians are already prepping for the fall of the southern front.

They will have cut russian territory in two, surrounded melitpol/berdyansk, isolated crimea from resupply, they will largely have reached rhe pre 2022 borders. That's why those lines are so heavily defended.

Its hard to know exactly but in the most well defended sectors of that frontline. It looks like Ukraine has advanced about 1-2km per week in these first 4 weeks.

Even if things didn't speed up, at all  and things continue at their current rate, 12 months from now they would have completed the advance and cut the russian occupation in two.

Firstly roughly 80-90% of the western equipped brigades still haven't been used (and probably won't be until they have a reliable path through minefields and are confident they've dealt with the aerial threat)

And they are being restocked with both apcs and MBTs- even on currently commited MBTs they have 30 Abrams and 100+ Leopard 1s expected this year. And then there are effectively unlimited replacements available for the (extremely powerful and well armored) Abrams.

In the last week they've had positive news on most fronts- i think they've realised that absent air superiority the key are advances on foot and they've made good progress using those tactics. The task will certainly get easier once they get proper aircover from F16s and more strike power in ATACMs (and it is shameful and idiotic that the US dithered on these for as long as it did) but they aren't waiting for those things, they're moving forward, they've opened another front across the Dnipro, things are progressing.

Manpower is only one factor but if your killing Russian companies to point only 20-40 people out of 100 are left. Something will have to give at some point. Russia doesn't have the equipment to sustain those type of consistent losses. Same with the artillery. This is a game of logistics and manpower. No different than a lot of battles in WWII. And those battles for key points took weeks and months to play out just for a handful of places.  

>So I don't really understand where your unwavering belief in Ukraine winning this attritional fight is coming from. All I see is whole lot of sweat and blood for tiny results.

It's not unwavering. This is the waiting and see phase. If you are getting this antsy over things in the early stages of the counter offensive, then take a month's break. Seriously. This is gonna be a long grind till see we start to see how things play out. I just know what tactic Ukraine is using. 

>Anyway, I guess time will tell - but in general this is completely awful for Ukraine. Bad for their economy - awful for their population levels, etc. And there's no telling how long it will take.

This war was already terrible for all of the things in Ukraine but it's far worse for Russia. Doesn't matter what Ukraine does since Russia started it. And it's even worse for Ukraine if Russia wins. So that point is kinda moot.",1688154451.0,1688153915.0,t3_14mpqrq,t1_jq65bov,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

It has been a neutral country for 68 years and has a notoriously underfunded military which is specialized on disaster relief, not military operations. Every attempt to equip the army properly is faced with criticism because the public views it as waste of money and weapons might even be seen as toys for the far-right. 

There are no mountains of modern war equipment hidden anywhere in Austria and due to the country's size it wouldn't be a main contributer even if the army was comparable to Switzerland’s (who, unlike Austria, takes the concept of ""armed neutrality"" pretty seriously which is why Switzerland has a sizeable arms industry).

Austria is specialized on disaster relief and humanitarian help and provides those things very willingly when they are needed, especially in eastern Europe. It's important that Ukraine gets both, humanitarian and military help, but that doesn't mean it's a problem when a country focuses on its strengths.
