Some strong language here from Estonia’s president, Alar Karis, who met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv today.  
  
We stand united with Ukraine. We will not walk away. We will continue to support you in every possible way.  
  
I praise the Ukrainian leaders who, despite constant provocations, remain calm and express willingness to solve this conflict peacefully.  
  
Russia must end the intolerable provocations and stop fuelling the conflict, which has been ongoing for eight years. Moscow should immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Ukraine’s territory and its immediate vicinity.  
  
We strongly condemn all military and hybrid actions against Ukraine. We regret that despite diplomatic efforts, there are no signs of willingness to de-escalate - quite the opposite, \[with\] the buildup of Russian forces continues, including in Belarus.  
  
I align myself with everyone who wishes we had a way to secure peace through the force of diplomacy and dialogue.  
  
Indeed, it is a decisive moment in European history. President Putin will answer to future generations for his violent actions. As European and western leaders, we also have the responsibility to step up to our values \[and\] our commitment to a Europe that is united and at peace. We regret every single life lost.  
  
It is our duty to protect our common values and the democracy we all helped to build. A threat to Ukraine is a threat to the security of Europe.  
  
The minimum we can do is to step up our practical support to Ukraine, which Estonia has done and will continue to do. In the EU, we will deliver on a massive package of sanctions and do so swiftly and decisively. But most importantly we must keep the door to EU and Nato open for Ukraine and we must have concrete next steps for further cooperation and integration.  
  
We know you will continue to value democracy and remain on the path of reforms. Eventually we will welcome you as the member of the European Union - you belong in Europe.  
  
We support Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We remain fully committed to the policy of non-recognition of illegal annexation of Ukraine’s territories. Ukraine has a right to defend its borders and independence and we continue helping Ukraine to build its military capabilities to stand against the aggression.

The territory currently controlled by the so-called people’s republics is less than half of the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but both entities claim sovereignty over the whole regions. In the summer of 2014, the Ukrainian army took back control over many towns that had initially been seized by Russia-backed separatists. If Russia recognises the territories in those borders, it raises the threat of a potential military campaign to retake them.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Tuesday questioned whether Ukraine had a right to sovereignty because he said the government in Kyiv did not represent the country’s constituent parts, the Interfax news agency reported.

“If we talk about the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, one of the key documents … is the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations among Peoples,” he was quoted as saying.

Lavrov accused Ukraine of being out of line with that since 2014 when a Moscow-backed president was overthrown in Kyiv and replaced by a pro-western leader, prompting Russia to annex Ukraine’s peninsula of Crimea and back an insurgency in its eastern regions.

“I don’t think anyone can claim that the Ukrainian regime, since the 2014 coup d’état, represents all the people living on the territory of the Ukrainian state,” Lavrov was quoted as saying.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Tuesday questioned whether Ukraine had a right to sovereignty because he said the government in Kyiv did not represent the country’s constituent parts, the Interfax news agency reported.  
  
“If we talk about the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, one of the key documents … is the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations among Peoples,” he was quoted as saying.  
  
Lavrov accused Ukraine of being out of line with that since 2014 when a Moscow-backed president was overthrown in Kyiv and replaced by a pro-western leader, prompting Russia to annex Ukraine’s peninsula of Crimea and back an insurgency in its eastern regions.  
  
“I don’t think anyone can claim that the Ukrainian regime, since the 2014 coup d’état, represents all the people living on the territory of the Ukrainian state,” Lavrov was quoted as saying.

UN security council members condemn Russia's actions  
For those just joining our live coverage now, here is a summary of what was exchanged during the United Nations emergency security council meeting which wrapped up just hours ago.  
  
It was an extraordinary war of words as representatives from the United States, the UK, France, Germany, India, Ireland, the UAE, Kenya and Ghana all emphatically urged peace and diplomacy in a bid to avert war in Ukraine.  
  
Addressing the session, US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield cast doubt on Putin’s assertion that the Russian troops would take on a “peacekeeping” role in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas.  
  
He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are.  
  
Referring to Putin’s recent allegations, the ambassador said his words amounted to a “series of outrageous, false claims” that were aimed at “creating a pretext for war.”  
  
Putin wants to travel back to a time when empires ruled the world. This is not 1919,” she added.  
  
The UK’s permanent representative to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, highlighted the humanitarian impact of a possible invasion.  
  
The actions Russia has chosen today will have severe and far-reaching consequences. First, to human life. An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine,” she said.  
  
In seeking to redraw borders by force, Russia’s actions show blatant contempt for international law.”  
  
After about an hour we finally heard from Russia ,with Vasily Nebenzya calling the prior statements a “direct verbal assault” and saying they would go “unanswered”.  
  
Nebenzya also attacked the west for “nudging” Ukraine towards conflict and accused other nations of overlooking the plight of those in the Donbas.  
  
Most of you did not find any place for the nearly four million residents of Donbas ... Our western colleagues have been unashamedly cramming weapons into Ukraine.”  
  
Russia then alleged Ukraine was on the brink of “military adventure”.  
  
Allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do.”  
  
Finally, Ukraine’s ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya took the stand, insisting that his country’s borders remain “unchangeable” despite Russia’s actions.  
  
We are on our own land. We are not afraid of anything or anyone, we owe nothing to anyone and we will not give away anything to anyone. There should be no doubt whatsoever.  
  
The international borders of Ukraine are and will remain unchangeable.  
  
We demand from Russia to cancel the decision on recognition and return to the table of negotiations.  
  
We condemn the order to deploy additional Russian occupation troops to the territories in Ukraine.  
  
We demand immediate and complete verifiable withdrawal of the occupation troops.  
  
The United Nations is sick. That’s a matter of fact. It has been hit by the virus spread by the Kremlin. Will it succumb to this virus?”

“We are committed to staying and to continue delivering in Ukraine, especially in eastern Ukraine,” UN spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci told reporters in Geneva.  
  
“We continue to be fully operational.”  
  
She acknowledged though that “as a result of the evolving situation on the ground, we have allowed for temporary relocation of some non-essential staff and some dependents”.  
  
The UN counts 1,510 staff members in Ukraine, including 149 international staff, Vellucci said.  
  
In all, around 100 staff members are based in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk.  
  
There have been warnings that a scale-up in the conflict could displace millions of people and cause a humanitarian crisis.  
  
The UN refugee agency said Tuesday that for now it was not seeing any increased movements outside the eastern regions.  
  
But “the situation does remain unpredictable,” spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo told reporters in Geneva.

  
Meanwhile, the UN humanitarian agency Ocha warned that it was seeing reports of increased hostilities in the east of Ukraine, which has been wracked by conflict for eight years already.  
  
Spokesman Jens Laerke said the UN was continuing to follow a humanitarian response plan put in place before the latest escalation in tensions, including most recently sending an aid convoy into the non-government controlled areas last Friday.  
  
He warned though that even that response lacks funding, stressing that the best preparation for what could possibly be a dramatic increase in needs was to finance the existing aid efforts on the ground.

eb5bdc82bd1c9f94d2f4dab1ad290173,syfneh,hxyaz2x,"Moscow is sending mixed signals about whether it will seek to conquer more territory in east Ukraine.  
  
The two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine claim that they should control more territory than they currently do. That includes the large city of Mariupol, which is on the government side of the front lines. If Moscow supports their claim, then Russia could launch an attack to capture that territory.  
  
So the key question in Moscow today is whether Russia is recognising the territories’ existing borders - or the territory they would like to control.  
  
Thus far, it’s not clear. A Russian deputy foreign minister gave a direct answer during a press conference that Russia recognises the borders in which those states “exercise their authority and jurisdiction”.  
  
That’s fairly straightforward - Russia supports the status quo.  
  
But then Vladimir Putin’s spokesman answered a similar question. Dmitry Peskov said that the borders are “those in which they exist and were proclaimed”.  
  
Those are different things. The proclaimed borders in 2014 include cities like Mariupol. The current borders do not.  
  
So what’s happening? The ambiguity may be intentional, allowing Vladimir Putin to make his decision on the basis of how the west responds to his formal occupation of Ukrainian territory.  
  
If he needs a new bargaining chip in his negotiations, he could threaten a new war to capture additional territory.  
  
On the other hand, it is possible that many of those speaking just don’t know the answer. Peskov, who was questioned at length by a BBC journalist, said he couldn’t add anything to his talking points.  
  
**For their part, the authorities in the Russian-controlled territories have said that they continue to view their borders as the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. If Moscow agrees, then a new war is a likely result.**

The country’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, also told US secretary of state Anthony Blinken in a phone call today that “the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be respected”.  
  
China’s reaction to Russia’s move in Ukraine has been under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks. On 4 February, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin pledged “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” in the bilateral relationship.  
  
But Moscow’s manoeuvre in Ukraine clearly posed a headache for Beijing. On the one hand, like Russia, China is frustrated with its deteriorating relations with the US and its allies. On the other hand, however, it does not foresee much diplomatic gain by fully backing Russia on its action in Ukraine.  
  
“The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected and safeguarded,” Wang told the Munich Security Conference by video link over the weekend. “Ukraine is no exception.”

While the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has said the presence of troops is evidence that the invasion of Ukraine has already begun, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, was more cautious when talking in Paris this morning.  
  
It was not, to his mind, he said, a “fully fledged invasion”. The comments reflect the nervousness in some EU capitals - including Paris and Berlin - at hitting Moscow too early with the full “unprecedented” package of sanctions prepared over recent weeks and being left without any further leverage over the Kremlin.  
  
In contrast, EU member states in the Baltics argue that Putin will only taunt the bloc with incremental incursions that have the appearance of falling shy of the threshold for the “massive costs and severe consequences” threatened by the bloc over a military invasion. Those EU governments argue that it will be death to Ukraine by a thousand cuts if the bloc prevaricates.

d7dcaa57510cdafc4da25aa4b149abd0,syfneh,hxyy22f,"Okay just my humble opinion, using logic and the data available (what Russia is saying and doing that we know):

It does not make any sense for Russia to stop here and none of the signs point to that. Time will tell and maybe the world is lucky and this is it. But here’s why I don’t think so. 

Russia has sent troops (officially) into the third of Donbas they controlled. If Russia stops here, they will be sanctioned (including losing NS2) to control a small piece of territory that is partially war torn, and that they already owned from afar. It makes zero sense at all. Why take the hit for something that’s small and that you own? Sure he did this in the past, and look at what happened to the Russian economy from 2014 incursions. 

Now looking at what Russia is saying. There is mixed messaging about if Russia considers all of Donbas independent, or just the third they control. But Putin basically went on a rant last night which basically made it clear he doesn’t think of Ukraine as it’s own independent culture or sovereign country. He has made it clear for years that Ukraine cannot join NATO. This week Ukraine made it clear their desire to join NATO is greater than ever. None of that makes me feel like Russia will stop now. It doesn’t add up. 

Finally what is Russia doing? Well they moved men into Donbas. Considering Ukraine has been unable to take back Donbas in almost a decade, and considering anyone with a brain knows they aren’t trying now, that should mean something. Why move so many troops into a region you know will not be taken? Show of force for sure. But still. Then there is the fact that Russia is still surrounding Ukraine. And we know that they have one of their largest and most mobile groups/armies near Kharkiv…well outside of Donbas. And we know their troop concentration near Donbas was smaller than multiple other locations. Could that be to ensure Ukraine has to spread its units out all over the place? Yeah. But why have they continued to move up to the borders all over? Why was blood moved to the front over a week ago? 

Most of these things can be explained away on their own, but when you add them altogether, it certainly paints a picture of further invasion. And like I said, pushing Ukraine further towards the west this fast, and taking sanctions, to control a small piece of territory you already controlled, would be really really dumb.",1645542584.0,1645542180.0,t3_syfneh,t3_syfneh,,0,25,0,25,1,0,

Putin announced they’d move “peace keepers” into regions they basically already occupy in east Ukraine. The rest of the world said they’d issue sanctions against Russia. It’s like crossing the line without really *crossing* the line.

Russia is most likely hoping/waiting for conflict to start between the “peacemakers” (soldiers) in east Ukraine and the people already there, so they can launch some sort of full fledged invasion into the rest of Ukraine and occupy it like they did with Crimea. This conflict will most likely be their reasoning to fully invade. 

If you live in the United States and are reading this, you won’t be affected - well barely. Your gas prices will most likely rise in the next coming weeks, somewhat substantially if Russia limits their oil exports as retaliation for sanctions imposed on them by the rest of the world.

Or Kosovo. They just declared themselves independent. And that's it? Nothing else needs to be done to become truly independent?

With Scotland it was pretty clear: a referendum said no. But what if it was yes? Is that all Scotland would have to do? ""Hey UK, we want independence. If our people say yes, then we leave""? Is it simple as that?

Michelle Bachelet said in a statement that she was “deeply concerned” following Putin’s decision to recognise the independence of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk separatist republics.  
  
“Any significant escalation in military action creates a heightened risk of serious human rights violations as well as violations of international humanitarian law,” Bachelet said.  
  
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stressed that “at this critical juncture, the priority, above all, must be to prevent a further escalation, and to prevent civilian casualties, displacement and destruction of civilian infrastructure”.  
  
“I call on all sides to cease hostilities and to pave the way for dialogue instead of setting the stage for further violence,” she added.  
  
The UN rights agency, she said, would “continue to monitor the situation closely from our offices on both sides of the contact line in the east of the country.”

c53c618074ecfb69db155cebff1b45ec,syfneh,hxy5ug2,"I will explain why Russia is invading Ukraine, and more importantly, why the Russian people generally support Putin and his decision to invade.

First some history and perspective. Crimea is to Russians what Gulf Coast beaches are to Americans. Russians have vacationed there for centuries. On December 8, 1991, the former Soviet Union fell apart, and Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia became three independent countries. Crimea was claimed by Ukraine, infuriating the Russians.

Splitting off eastern Ukraine and Crimea from the new country of RUSSIA in 1991 was like splitting off the GULF COAST STATES from the United States of America and making them a new country.

Nearly 10 years ago (2013), Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Crimea to ""reclaim it for Mother Russia."" It was a brutal war that saw Russian forces successfully claim the peninsula on the Black Sea for Russia. However, most people don't realize that the eastern half of Ukraine, drawing a line south of Kyiv down to Crimea, since 1991 and the break-up of the Soviet Union has always been considered by Putin and the Russian people as part of Russia (just like Crimea). In other words, to Russians, an invasion of the eastern half of Ukraine is taking back what is rightfully Russia's.

So, why do Putin and the Russian people think this?

In July of the same year that Russia invaded Crimea (2013), Russian President Vladimir Putin flew to Kyiv. Traveling with Putin was the patriarch of Russia's Orthodox Church, the religious leader who serves both Russians and Ukrainians through the Church. Their trip commemorated the 1,025th anniversary of the baptism of Prince Vladimir of the Kyivan Rus (AD 988) and the subsequent adoption of Christianity by the 'Rus'-sian people. In other words, ""Mother Russia"" was born in Kyiv. To Russians, Kyiv is what Philadelphia is to Americans. It will always be the birthplace of ""Russia.”

Everyone needs to recognize that the people of Russia back Putin in this invasion of eastern Ukraine because they feel - just like they felt about Crimea in 2013 - that Russia is taking back what rightfully belongs to them. You add all this history to what Putin views as a build up of UN forces around him and this is what you are left with.

In the best-case scenario after the invasion, a new Ukraine will encompass the western half and the eastern land (including Kyiv) will become part of Russia.  In the worst-case scenario,  other countries will join the fray, and regional war, then a world war, will flare.

These days are set up exactly like World War II when Hitler claimed Poland was part of Germany and had been ""stolen"" from the German people. Hitler launched an invasion on September 1, 1939, under the pretext of taking back what rightfully belonged to Germany. More than two years later, on December 7, 1941, the United States joined what was eventually called World War II.",False,1645525352.0,t3_syfneh,t3_syfneh,,0,10,0,10,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Putin would not have ever retreated the troops. If he did without ""winning"" anything he would have been seen as a paper tiger. So now he has something to show for all the BS.

US sanctions are a joke. They currently only ban all goods from the Donetsk and Luhansk. And they barely do any business there. But now Biden can act tough and show that he stopped Putin and has some sanctions to show for it. He cannot sanction Russia too bad because if oil prices go up, so do the gas prices in the US and his mid-term results are going to suck.

Ukraine now technically has an end to the war that started in 2014. They can show that they stopped Putin, and the areas they gave up were only the ones they had no control over for many years. Things blow over, their economy bounces back.

UK can show some strength as well with sanctions. Borris is happy because he was about to get kicked, maybe now the news cycle has changed and he might have a small chance.

Canada's Foreign affairs minister said that the new sanctions they are imposing are only the ""initial sanctions"" and IF Russia ""invades further"" then the big boy sanctions come out.

So as I see it, everyone comes out looking relatively decent. Things de-escalate. Putin claims victory, Biden does too because he stopped the Russian aggression. Ukraine end up being somewhat of a sacrificial lamb, but they are somewhat happy, because when things de-escalates and their economy rebounds. They also stop spending money on their army fighting a never ending war in Donetsk and Luhansk.

But maybe I am way off base, only time will tell.

EDIT: Adding another reason on why I think I think the West cannot afford to have Russia take over Ukraine, is because of China. China is the country that will be the most interested in the outcome of this, because they are interested in making a play for Taiwan. If the West folds on Ukraine, then Taiwan will be easy game for China. China is a military and economic powerhouse. So if Russia can pull off taking over the largest country in Europe, then Taiwan does not stand a chance. Why would the West be so interested in Taiwan?

eb5bdc82bd1c9f94d2f4dab1ad290173,syfneh,hxy6uyk,"What is still unclear is what borders Russia are recognizing:

Russia’s legislature is expected to rubberstamp the Kremlin’s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed territories in Luhansk and Donetsk on Tuesday, paving the way for Russian troops to formally occupy Ukrainian territory in what they call a “peacekeeping mission”.  
  
But a key question remains: In what borders will Russia recognise its two proxy territories? The fine print could determine whether Vladimir Putin is preparing to launch a broader invasion in Ukraine.  
  
Both of the Russian-backed territories lay claim to Ukrainian territories that are not currently under their control. For instance, the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic has said that it should control the city of Mariupol, which is firmly on the Ukrainian side of the line of conflict.  
  
If Russia recognises those larger territorial ambitions, then under the terms of the treaty Putin signed with the territories yesterday, it would imply a further war of conquest backed by Russia is to come.  
  
Andrei Kortunov, the director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, said:  
  
The open question is what particular borders they’re going to defend. The question is whether these newly recognised republics might have territorial claims … that might constitute a casus belli.  
  
If we assume that Russia is not interested in a big war in Ukraine – because that would definitely mean a war – then we can assume the ball is in the Western court.  
  
In Kortunov’s thinking, Putin may wait before sending large numbers of troops into the territories in order to gauge the Western response:  
  
The West needs to decide how it is going to react - what kind of sanctions and what will happen to the political dialogue between Moscow and Western capitals?  
  
Some western analysts believe that Russia’s massive buildup of more than 190,000 troops near the borders of Ukraine indicates that Putin plans on more than just a recognition of the two territories.  
  
According to Michael Kofman of the CNA thinktank:  
  
Russia doesn’t need 190k troops on Ukraine’s borders to recognize the independence of separatist republics. These troops are not even near the Donbas. This is the first step in what will likely be a large-scale Russian \[military\] operation to impose regime change.  
  
The decision to recognise the territories also will likely scuttle the Minsk agreements, a peace deal that Moscow hoped to use as leverage to force Ukraine into imposing unpopular political decisions about the conflict.  
  
Russia appeared to be leaving the question of the borders open on Tuesday morning before the parliament sessions. Leonid Kalashnikov, an MP, initially told Russian media the Duma would recognise the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) as the territories recognised at “referendums” in 2014.  
  
“This agreement does not specify \[the borders\], but I think it means statehood, which was approved in the old and only referendum that was held in other borders than those currently occupied by the DPR,” Kalashnikov told reporters on Tuesday, answering a question from Interfax.  
  
“How these borders will be restored is not provided for in this agreement. How they will be restored is not our competence,” said Kalashnikov, the head of the a Duma committee that manages issues dealing with ex-Soviet countries.  
  
But he soon clarified his remarks, which many took to imply a coming war, saying that they were just his “personal opinion”.  
  
In his speech on Monday, Putin appeared to be setting the stage for Russian claims to far more than just the Donbas regions:  
  
From those who have seized and are holding power in Kyiv, we demand an immediate cessation of hostilities. Otherwise, the entire responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine.

The main concern of a man like that is that if maidan becomes a success, it is a threat to his power. Because of that, he will always seek to keep Ukraine destabilized and broken.

Hypothetically, sanctions could still influence him, but his recent behavior shows that he is willing to accept the cost. Moreover, sanctions will never make him back down from what he already has as this would signal too much weakness. 

Because of this, the purpose of the sanctions should be to hurt the economy as much as possible by stopping all trade possible. This will directly affect their budget for the military and other aggressive means, like cyberattacks. In addition, it puts pressure on the population to stand up against the regime.

With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated ""slice by slice"" until it realizes, usually too late, that it is virtually gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the ""sliced"" sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion.

Recently Russia proposed a series of what appears to be false flags of ammunition blowing up in there territory. They also staged many false flags in the seperatist areas of Ukraine..

Russia used these false flag events to claim that the self proclaimed people's republic of Donetsk and Luhansk were under threat. 

Putin has since claimed that the whole regions of Luhansk and Donetsk need to have the right to independence to protect Russian citizens. He has moved in forces to take the rest of these regions from Ukraine.

Up until now there has been a peace treaty in Donetsk called Minsk 2 preventing any further fighting by both the rebels and Ukraine.
Signed by Ukraine, Russia and France.

That has been voided by Putin claiming that the entire Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts are independent of Ukraine itself.

Putin is now said to be sending in ""peacekeepers"" to the area. Unfortunately like we have seen with Russian peacekeepers in Syria these troops are not actually peaceful and often carry heavy artillery.

He has also put out a speech saying he wants to revive the Soviet union. A Soviet union that is now dissolved. Putin wants to do this by taking all the independent Soviet states that ceded from the Soviet Union in 1991.

> Dugin spent two years studying the geopolitical, semiotic and esoteric theories of the controversial German scholar Herman Wirth (1885-1981), one of the founders of the German Ahnenerbe. This resulted in the book Hyperborean Theory (1993), in which Dugin largely endorsed Wirth's ideas as a possible foundation for his Eurasianism.[43] Apparently, this is ""one of the most extensive summaries and treatments of Wirth in any language"".[44] According to the Moldavian anthropologist Leonid Mosionjnik Wirth's overtly wild ideas fitted perfectly well in the ideological void after the demise of communism, liberalism and democracy.[45] Dugin also promoted the legend that Wirth had written an important book on the history of the Jewish People and the Old Testament, the so-called Palestinabuch, which could have changed the world had it not been stolen.[46]

> The Ahnenerbe (German: [ˈʔaːnənˌʔɛʁbə], ancestral heritage) operated as a think tank in Nazi Germany between 1935 and 1945. Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer-SS, established it as an SS appendage devoted to the task of promoting the racial doctrines espoused by Adolf Hitler and his governing Nazi Party, specifically by supporting the idea that the modern Germans descended from an ancient Aryan race seen as biologically superior to other racial groups.[citation needed] The group comprised scholars and scientists from a broad range of academic disciplines.

I'm very pro-Ukraine in this situation, but I think dismissing the arguments that some people have towards blaming the west/US as well as Russia is kind of close minded. 

There are definitely arguments to be made that the west should have never left the doors open for Ukraine to join the EU/NATO to begin with, and many would argue (fairly) that those doors being open are primarily why we are here now, and that a countries right to choose shouldn't jeopardize the national security of others.


edit: I want to make it abundantly clear, Ukraine should have a right to choose who it decides to work with. Like I said I am pro Ukraine.

I used to think that you are either logical, or not. Those that are ruled by emotion always have been. But living in the US and watching what happened during the Trump years, I've learned that's not the case. 

We all balance our logical brain and our emotional one. Sometimes one tends to preside over the other and sometimes and sometimes it's not clear. But I've seen many people make completely irrational, poorly thought out decisions when they get overly emotional. Reasonable people start believing in pizza basement child sex dungeons run by the presidential candidate, or that their freedoms are lost and a dictatorship established because because someone asked them to wear a mask, or because someone asked them to think be sensitive about other races.

I've watched on the news a loving spouse of 40 years beat and kill their wife because she asked for a divorce. 

Sometimes people get so wrapped up in their feelings and beliefs that logic and reason can no longer penetrate their minds. We call these people ideologues and they are among the most dangerous people on earth. Their theories become more important than reality.

Maybe this is some kind of grand plan, maybe Putin has everything worked out 5 steps ahead of the other 8 billion people on the planet, no one else can figure it out and his goals are achievable and he's done the cost benefit analysis. Or maybe, he's an ideologue working towards some belief he's created in his own mind, or some shared collective belief like the re-establishment of the Russian Empire and he's going to bring it to fruition even if it means millions die in the process.

Sure it seems clunky and unhelpful (to Ukraine especially right now), but we know where the red line is, and Putin knows.

If Hitler had a firm defense pact (and not the mutual defense pacts that was basically governed by the participants themselves) he would have not gotten as far as he had before war was triggered.

The entire reason England _and_ France declared war in Sept 1939 was because their defensive pact with Poland did not offer either of them an out, and they had to honor their commitments regardless.

Nato is there to stop another Hitler, Putin is doing the small land grabs on countries to stop them from joining nato (there is a clause that you cannot join Nato if you have an active,ongoing or unresolved border or territorial dispute.).

That's an exaggeration, but there's already a cost of living crisis associated with rising fuel costs and sanctioning Russia would drive those prices up higher - they have already start to rise just from the risk that there \*will\* be sanctions. And this price hike will hit the elderly hard. If fuel simply isn't available, it's not an exaggeration to predict that a lot of elderly people won't make it through the winter. It's part of the reason Putin's pressing the assault now: if he waits till late spring / summer Europe has less to fear in the short term from imposing fuel sanctions on him, because people won't be using anything like as much fuel.

SWIFT sanctions could also harm Russia a lot in the short term - but they haven't done that yet because the economic backlash would most likely result in China developing an alternative digital payment system outside of Western influence. So this move would harm Russia but most likely bolster China, which isn't ideal.

However, now that the pro independence parties in Scotland are agitating for a second referendum, it is still up to London to decide whether it goes ahead (which is being denied at the moment).",1645530679.0,1645530391.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxybshd,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

If part of a country breaks away and most other countries accept this breakaway state as a new country, then a new country it is. On the other hand, if hardly anyone considers your new country to be a legitimate country, then you won't get very far.

Of course, not all countries are equal in the value of their recognition. If a breakaway state is recognized by a large and powerful country, such as the US or China, then that carries more weight than if that state gets the backing of a small country. Geographical proximity also matters. If all your neighbours recognize your new country as an independent state, then it's less important what some faraway country thinks.

In general, western countries will only recognize countries that have broken away from other western countries if the ""parent"" country approves of the split. This means that Catalonia won't be recognized by western countries unless Spain is OK with it.

Boris needs to freeze and take all Russian assets (money, property etc) within London.

Dugin's Eurasitic ideology therefore aims at the unification of all Russian-speaking peoples in a single country through the forced territorial dismemberment of the former republics of the Soviet Union.[39][40]


> Before war broke out between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Dugin visited South Ossetia and predicted, ""Our troops will occupy the Georgian capital Tbilisi, the entire country, and perhaps even Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which is historically part of Russia, anyway.""[75] Afterwards he said Russia should ""not stop at liberating South Ossetia but should move further,"" and ""we have to do something similar in Ukraine.""[76] In 2008, Dugin stated that Russia should repeat the Georgian scenario in Ukraine, namely attack it.[77] In September 2008, after the Russian-Georgian war, he did not hide his anger towards Putin, who ""dared not drop the other shoe"" and ""restore the Empire.""[71]

 >The right of a people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a jus cogens rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms. It states that peoples, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. The concept was first expressed in the 1860s, and spread rapidly thereafter. During and after World War I, the principle was encouraged by both Soviet Premier Vladimir Lenin and United States President Woodrow Wilson.

Would the people of Russia be on board with such severe sanctions. Maybe initially, but they are already hurting, this would just destroy their economy. And I think Putin cannot hold on to power if the majority of his population is hurting.

The other reason I think the West cannot afford to have Russia take over Ukraine, is because of China. China is the country that will be the most interested in the outcome of this, because they are interested in making a play for Taiwan. If the West folds on Ukraine, then Taiwan will be easy game for China. China is a military and economic powerhouse. So if Russia can pull off taking over the largest country in Europe, then Taiwan does not stand a chance. Why would the West be so interested in Taiwan?

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had some influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

All analysts' agree that Putin does not really want a war in Ukraine. It is a territory too large to hold and it has a huge population that would resist a Russian invasion.  
Putin wants Ukraine out of Nato and he's threatening to invade if things don't go his way. The US can't really accept that Russia could decide if another country were to join Nato and they'd have to explain other eastern Europeans why did they just accept Russia's terms.  

The US and Russia are talking about how to make everyone happy, but no one wants to appear weak in front of its people and allies. The Ukrainians' opinion isn't that relevant for both the Empires.  

Putin, Ukrainians and Nato countries may not want a war, but if tension escalate too much things could go out of hand. The leaders of the rebel republics seems to be infamous for not being too bright (check the metadata thing that happened a few days ago) and unreliable. So Putin MAY just have occupied the rebel territories to shut them up and stop them from doing something stupid. He occupied two territories that were pretty much controlled by Russia, so it wasn't really a big leap.  

Problem is, now Russian forces are really at the border of Ukraine, which puts everyone in a difficult position. So far the US is only threatening to sanctions the two rebel republics but reaching an agreement is getting difficult.",1645546874.0,1645542050.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxy58zc,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

People who are dual citizens by birth (or because of a few other reasons) are exempted from this loss.

However, the DPR (and LPR) are not recognized as independent nations by Ukraine, so any Ukranians who have taken up DPR citizenship may not lose their citizenship that way, simply because Ukraine doesn't consider DPR citizenship to be a real thing. Another way to lose Ukrainian citizenship is to join the military of a foreign power. Again, it's questionable if the DPR qualifies as such, since Ukraine sees it as an internal rebellion.

Finally, there are international treaties that try to prevent countries from making someone ""stateless"" (without any citizenship). Since DPR isn't recognized internationally, Ukraine would likely not be allowed to revoke the citizenship of anyone getting a DPR citizenship or joining the DPR armed forces. So it seems likely that most ""DPR citizens"" are also still ""Ukranian citizens"" and ultimately what matters for things like conscription in this situation is that people with guns knock on your door and tell you that you have to join the army. The paperwork and formalities take a back seat there.

Note that a further complication is that Russia has been handing out passports to many DPR (and LPR) residents, making them Russian citizens (which helps to feed the ""Russians in Ukraine are under attack"" narrative from the Kremlin). These people could lose their Ukranian citizenship since voluntarily taking up Russian citizenship is a reason for Ukraine to revoke the Ukranian citizenship. The treaties on the prevention of statelessness don't apply, since Russia is an internationally recognized nation.

The question is how well documented all of this is. If someone takes up Russian citizenship, but simply doesn't inform the Ukranian authorities, nothing happens. And with the Donbass region being a conflict zone for some time now, its quite likely that the bureaucracy hasn't exactly kept up.",False,1645522284.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxxzem6,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

[I'm gonna leave this lecture here from an expert on Political science and international relations, this was back when Putin annexed Crimea](https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4)   It's an hour long but this guy only really talks for ~40 minutes and then answers questions. I think his position is pretty interesting and he definitely answers this question(though I don't agree on everything he's said) 


But to answer the question from fair rationalization of the other side(once again, **not my personal position**) NATO and EU should have been off limits to Ukraine from the dissolution of the Soviet Union because Russia didn't support an alliance that close to their borders, that Russia felt primarily existed to destabilize Russia and damage their national security, and that alliances shouldn't be formed if it damages another nations national security.",False,1645541799.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxyvshk,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Like I said in my original comment, I am Pro-Ukraine, I think Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO or the European Union without fear of another country attacking it, 


But I think that your stance that ""If you think NATO being in Ukraine jeopardizes Russia you are paranoid"" isn't true. I'm certainly not saying that it would lead to an immediate invasion of Russia, but it definitely would be a major destabilizing force having a *western* alliance with *nuclear* capabilities that rival Russia's own. NATO countries also have to be Democracies which is another major destabilizing factor, having a successful western democracy where the Russian language is commonly spoken 

It's one of the major reasons why NATO members and the EU have been so slow to fully integrate Ukraine into NATO and the EU in fact, because NATO members understand that if they allowed Ukraine to fully join, Even if there was no war in Donbas, Russia would see it as a destabilizing force large enough to go to war with NATO over, and that also leads people to come to conclusions of their own: ""If NATO never had any intention of allowing Ukraine in, why did they start the process if not to destabilize Russia""


edit: to conclude I am pro-Ukraine not only because I support Ukraine's right to choose what alliances they join, but also because its clear that the west has absolutely fucked Ukraine by never having any interest in admitting them as an official NATO member even though they said they did.",1645543127.0,1645542618.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxywfes,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Hitler hoped that the units assigned to Steiner would be able to stage an effective counterattack against the northern pincer of the Soviet assault on Berlin, but Steiner refused to attack upon realizing the units were inadequate and  understrength, being made up of some soldiers, Hitler Youth teens and emergency Air Force ground personnel and Navy dockworkers.

Just because Putin can live with sanctions doesn't mean they aren't the right course of action here. Comprehensive sanctions *can* harm the Russian economy, especially if Western Europe looked to diversify its energy imports.  And if Germany were to permanently cancel Nordstream it would be a huge blow.

Putin and his allies definitely understand their power is not dependent on the Russian economy... Russians are, historically, highly tolerant of economic hardships, even those caused by their own leaders.  So Putin can move to secure his legacy rebuilding the Russian Empire without too much domestic hazard.

But our objectives are still served by imposing a high cost on Putin for doing so.  A united front and strong sanctions may bolster domestic opposition to Putin but, more importantly, they illustrate to the world (especially China) that the West isn't dead.  It's still capable of standing together to resist authoritarians.  Sanctions show such leaders they can't expand their borders by force with impunity, even in situations where the West is resistant to military confrontation.

And it should be noted that China is far, far more sensitive to sanctions than Russia.  Russia doesn't have as much economic or diplomatic dependence on the West like China does.  Other than energy supply, Russia doesn't export much to the West.  China does, and much of its economic prosperity is dependent upon good business relations with the West, particularly financial investment abroad.

With the dissolution of USSR, its inheritance was split among the counties, part of it were diamond reserves kept in swiss banks. While this was fine and dandy, the problem was that countires couldn't access them because Russia was the majority holder so it was essentially blocked off from everyone else. Russia then bullied its way to get them fully. 

Georgia, for example, got an offer in the 90's, that Russia would erase Georgia's debt for gas if they gave up their share. While not exactly a fair trade, it was, as the government in the 90's thought, better than nothing. They agreed and signed. Problem is, Georgian copy of the deal was lost on the way back (or stolen or given to Russia by an insider, who knows at this point). With any other country this wouldn't be a problem, just ask the other side for their copy. With Russia, the copy received was erasing a smaller part of the debt than originally agreed upon. Of course, Georgia protested, and Russia was ""take it or leave it"". Georgia refused to sign for a while, but in 2000's they wanted to get into international trade agreements, which essentially necessitated that Georgia didn't have any disputes, like the agreement one, active.

People have written books about how the land Ukraine is on has historically be used to protect the Russian heartland and how a western-allied Ukraine fundamentally undermines Russia's national security, but I will do my best in a very concise way to explain.

Russia, and most of Eastern Europe for that matter, exist in a region known as [the European plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Plain) In modern war with mobile warfare it takes very little time to move through these regions practically speaking. A key factor in Stalin not pulling his own troops/influence out of Eastern Europe after WW2 was because he witnessed how important these lands were for slowing the Nazis and making it very difficult to take Moscow. But you can also go back another century and a few decades during the Napoleonic wars and also see those lands being used similarly to slow the French advance to Moscow. 


And with that in mind, NATO is an alliance that has existed to destabilize and undermine USSR (and post 1992) Russian influence. NATO exists for a lot larger reasons these days but its creation was a reaction to the Soviet Union. 


>The only way NATO could ""destabilize"" Russia by accepting Ukraine is if Russia's stability depends on attacking Ukraine

I disagree and I think you aren't considering the fact that a Neutral Ukraine has very similar benefits to Russia as a Russia-alligned Ukraine in terms of stabilization. A NATO allied Ukraine is a Ukraine that is hosting an alliance and their weaponry at Russia's doorstep, which even if you don't think that is a real threat, to the people of Russia it is because they don't see NATO like you or I do, because you and I have never been threatened by NATO before, for simply just existing in a country that doesn't allign itself to the same views of the west. This is a cultural thing and that is probably another reason why you may not be understanding fully why its so destabilizing.",1645548857.0,1645548643.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxz9yif,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

> How would their economy fare?

It could be catastrophic.  It would mean that they would not be able to trade currency securely from one nation to another, in other words that they could not be paid for their exports (which are the vast majority of their economy).

It is believed that Russia has been developing a SWIFT alternative to facilitate currency transactions in the event of them being shut off from SWIFT, but it is highly unlikely that it is going to be as secure or sophisticated as SWIFT.  Which means that they will become a ripe target for transnational theft, or even having their SWIFT alternative shut down by foreign intelligence services.

The Germans, led by the Nazi’s, had different opinions.  They wanted to fight to right the wrong done to them after WWI.

Another reason for Appeasement was simply Britain buying time to build up its own military.

There is a history, especially post Soviet Union of NATO being mobilized outside of Article V (Libya, Bosnia specifically are mentioned alot), and that is ultimately what rests in the mind of Putin and the Russian people. Regardless of if you feel those conflicts were justified with NATO intervention, they did not use Article V, the key factor in NATO being exclusively a defensive alliance, to come to aid in these conflicts. 

Like I said initially, I agree that Ukraine should be allowed to choose their alliances and that their own security should come first before another nations stability, but I also think there is a lot more nuance to NATO and Russian fears than a lot of reddit accepts.

The majority of our oil and gas supply is produced domestically and almost all of the rest comes from Canada and Mexico. There isn't any significant threat to the oil and gas supply in either the US, Mexico, or Canada which requires significant military protection. 

That's a somewhat naive view of how this works.  While at present the US is ever so slightly a net ***exporter*** of oil we're only so in aggregate.  Different parts of the US are net international importers and exporters, for example while Los Angeles is an enormous oil field that happens to have a city in it, the West Coast is a large net importer of oil.  Meanwhile Alaska exports oil out the wazoo to the Pacific rim.  Northeast is a massive net importer.  In addition to crude production Texas has refinery capacity and capabilities that are the envy of the world and exports a tremendous amount of refined product.  Florida imports a lot via Port Everglades.  We have so much domestic natural gas production that we're actually ramping up exports via ship because it's economically viable to do is.  And that's just the domestic operations, US oil companies have operations that span the globe.

Yes there are domestic pipelines, but even domestic to domestic there's plenty that goes via ship.  Then there's everything else that goes internationally which the US Navy effectively guards by ensuring trade routes are secure.  This includes oil that US companies pump and ship which never touches domestic soil.  And because oil is a very international market the Navy is effectively protecting foreign companies moving oil among foreign countries.  If a tanker going from Indonesia to South Korea gets hijacked or blown up then we feel that immediately in pricing.

The safety and more importantly the stability of that all that trade is part of what keeps our prices at the pump low.

>Vehicle exhaust contains similar components in every country and the US has some of the best emission standards, including some of the lowest uses of diesel for passenger cars (which are more carcinogenic), compared to other developed nations. It also has lower population densities than many other nations, which helps mitigate the effects of exhaust. There isn't any evidence that I have seen that US healthcare costs are more strongly impacted by transportation emissions than other developed nations. 

The part you're missing is that other developed nations have the healthcare costs paid for via the government.  When the government is the one footing the bill for cancer treatments they then have an aligned interest in reducing those costs.  Meanwhile here in the US every tumor increases GDP, horray!  Taxing the shit out of gasoline use to pay for healthcare means they're aligning costs.  You cause more disease by using more gasoline, you pay more for healthcare directly and at the pump.  Here the costs burden the victims instead of the aggressors.

>The reason gasoline is often more expensive in other countries is because they have longer supply chains for petroleum (most of Europe, for instance, is heavily reliant on Asia for petroleum). They also typically have higher gas taxes.

They're also taxed as a means of trying to limit the net outflow of wealth from those countries.  Sometimes you can just be a king and decree that salt and pepper are the only spices permitted on the table as a means of limiting gold exiting the country, but in the modern world governments try to use tax policies to encourage activity that helps the country and discourage activities that harm the country.  It's why fire example consumer electronics are so expensive in Brazil, they have no domestic industry and to an extent they're unnecessary imports.  Life can in fact go on without a PlayStation.  Countries work hard to try to get to a net positive international trade and tax policy is a tool to get there.  Don't have a oil extraction and fuel refinery industry large enough to support domestic use?  You can only export so much wool to try to make up for it but it would be better if you had a lower goal to start with, because every barrel of oil that shows up at port is yet another sheep that needs to be sheered, processed, and exported.",False,1645520219.0,t3_syfneh,t1_hxxv14s,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
