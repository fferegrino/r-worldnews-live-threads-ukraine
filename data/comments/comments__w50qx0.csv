I'm 30, I live in Kyiv, have a job in game development. First couple of month were physically hard, you know, air strike alarm ~10 times a day and loud explosions almost every day. Then it got easier physically but also got harder mentally. I can't actually remember when I heard an explosion last time, I believe it was more than a month ago on darnytsya rail depot. And it is kinda devastating, because me not hearing it doesn't mean it doesn't happen just 100 or 300km from here every day just like it was for me couple of month ago. I haven't lost anyone really close to me yet, but I know a lot who did. I shame myself for being too ""soft"" for army, so I try to donate to UAF as much as I can. I also began exercising physically and practicing firearms handling, if shit is gonna go down further, which I believe it definitely will. My last post on worldnews live tread was a bit depressing. This one is a bit more paranoid. But it's definitely better now. Now I'm not going to die if I'm not taking at least 3 russians with me.

P.S. thanks for weapons. Please send more. And ammo. Media goes like they are already weakened and utterly fucked (which they are) but they still have so much more shit, that it'll most likely take at least couple of years from here. Please do not get tired to help us. Love.",False,1658531439.0,t3_w50qx0,t3_w50qx0,,0,215,0,215,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Day 149 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet here, but at 11pm instead of sending missiles, which is what they usually do, Russians decided to start shelling us. I’m not sure if that shelling was aimed at the city itself, as it was very loud inside of the city, but the fire started somewhere on the outskirts, north from Kharkiv, behind the ring road, so that shelling was most likely aimed at something in oblast.

We actually thought that they wouldn’t launch their missiles today, as it was surprisingly quiet other than that shelling at 11pm. But they didn’t forget their missiles, they just fired them much later than usual, at 4:10am, an hour ago from now. They also only fired 2 missiles, and they were aimed at something in Kharkiv oblast, none made it into the city, I guess this is the fifth day with no missiles, and it does feel pretty nice.

What is interesting is that when they were firing their usual 4-6 missile per day, they basically stopped shelling us, it was just the missiles at the scheduled time and nothing else. But as soon as they started conserving their missiles they started shelling us again. They are substituting their missing missiles with shelling. 

In the first two months of the war we were being shelled relentlessly every single day, but there were basically no missiles fired at us. Then in May, when the Russians were pushed away from Kharkiv, the shelling pretty much stopped, but instead they started firing 4-8 missiles per day at us. And now, in the past week, after they started conserving their missiles, it’s basically 50/50 between missile strikes and shelling.",False,1658542570.0,t3_w50qx0,t3_w50qx0,,0,102,0,102,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 22 July 2022
 
- In the Donbas, Ukrainian forces continue to repel Russian attempts to assault the Vuhlehirsk power plant. Russian artillery remains focused on areas around the cities of Kramatorsk and Siversk.

- On 21 July 2022, Vitaly Kim, governor of Ukraine's Mykolaiv region, said that Russian forces had used seven air defence missiles to strike infrastructure, energy facilities and storage areas.

- Russia has increased its use of air defence missiles in a secondary ground attack mode because of critical shortages of dedicated ground-attack missiles. Russian has almost certainly deployed S-300 and S-400 strategic air defence systems, designed to shoot down aircraft and missiles at long ranges, near Ukraine from the start of invasion.

- These weapons have relatively small warheads, designed to destroy aircraft. They could pose a significant threat against troops in the open and light buildings but are unlikely to penetrate hardened structures. There is a high chance of these weapons missing their intended targets and causing civilian casualties because the missiles they are not optimised for this role, and their crews will have little training for such missions.

2/3 - Russia has likely used as much as 55-60% of its high-precision weaponry reserve; 

- Russian forces may be storing equipment in Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant facilities to protect it against Ukrainian strikes.

3/3 - Russian troops still have not captured any decisive ground around Siversk, most likely they will not be able to take Sloviansk and Bakhmut; 

- Russian forces conducted an unsuccessful ground attack north of Kharkiv and in the Kherson region.

Two years after Dr. Strangelove came out, it wasn’t just Stanley Kubrick who was contemplating the ramifications of a world under threat of thermonuclear ICBM barrages. The US military was very concerned about what would happen if the Soviet Union launched a nuclear sneak-attack. They wanted to be able to survive, and to keep fighting.



So they commissioned the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to come up with a way to maintain command and control in the event of a massive nuclear first-strike. Their solution was ARPANET, a system of decentralized packet-sharing computer protocols that remain the fundamental building-blocks for how the internet works today.



ARPANET was a revolutionary concept. You couldn’t knock it out by hitting the central hub because there was no central hub. You could knock out 80% of it and it might slow down a little, but it would keep working. The military really liked that idea.


The assumption was that a first-strike would destroy the Pentagon first, and any other buildings full of generals that there were. The assumption was that most of the generals would get killed and that it would become necessary to fight a war without them. The thinkers also looked at ARPANET and wondered if it’s intrinsic survivability could be copied for the entirety of the military.


They thought that they could do it, but they knew it wasn’t going to be easy. Survivable networks depended on moving as far away from centralized hierarchal structures as possible, which went against 100s, or even thousands of years of military thinking. You don’t want to even have a pentagon, or any other kind of hub. You didn’t want chains of command that go all the way to the top. The very fabric of the military needed re-weaving.


But they got to work anyway. Almost 60 years later, they have pretty much done it. The pentagon remains where it was. Hub and spoke networks still exist. But contingency plans are in place and have been tested in war-games that show that the US military can keep fighting even after an all-out sneak-attack has taken place. They don’t really need the generals now. Captains, lieutenants, colonels, connected to the Internet, can keep the fighting going just fine.


Russia got Internet, too, but they did none of the other stuff. Strict top-heavy hierarchies are more entrenched in Russia than pretty much anywhere else. Rank is more than just a place in a command structure, it’s your identity, your worth. And today the outdated way that the Russian military is structured is showing its limitations in a big way.



The Ukrainians had to take a crash course. They had eight years. When people talk about ‘modernizing’ a military they aren’t just talking about buying or building fancy new weapons. Fancy weapons are nice, but that’s the easy part. Re-structuring the entire way that decisions get made, orders get given and taken, is a whole lot more difficult. Ukraine made amazing progress on that in eight years. Not perfect, but it seems pretty clear to me that the benefits of a military that uses state-of-the-art thinking on command-structure, a military that uses distributed networks instead of hierarchies as much as possible, are enormous.



Today the Ukrainian military is a lot more survivable than the Russian military. The Russian military is fragile thanks to its old-fashioned structure. The Ukrainians obviously know that, and have been targeting the command hubs effectively. I don’t predict a long slog of pushing the Russian lines backwards, I predict a collapse at some point. That is how top-heavy structures fail, they can only take so much damage before they completely collapse.

They were based in the west of the country, so they weren't close to where the fighting was happening, but Russia's bombed cities in the west (I remember thinking about a coworker from Ivano-Frankivsk while watching a video of the Russians hitting the airport there with a cruise missile on the first day of the war, for instance), and I'd suspect a large number of them have gone into the army or Territorial Defense (most of them were in their 20s or 30s), so they could be deployed to areas where the fighting is heavy.

One is the fact that, when Erdogan finally arrived, Putin stepped forward to greet him. That looked like an over-eager appeasement move to me; if Putin wanted to look strong, he should have stood there quietly, as though he were the one in control, and let Erdogan approach *him*. 

Maybe he thought that move would make him look as though he controlled the dais and was inviting Erdogan up there, but to me it looked like he was impatient and relieved that Erdogan didn't make him wait longer.

Second, there's the handshake dynamic. You'll see this a lot in greetings between politicians and business execs, if you watch for it. Erdogan took Putin's hand, then pulled it forward into *his* body space, creating an imbalance in their positions.

TL;DR: The S300 was designed with ground-ground capability in mind, just wasn't a priority. Starting around 2010, RU began replacing S300s with S400s, meaning they suddenly had a lot of spare S300s. Since Tochka cruise missiles were getting phased out as well, they started upgrading S300s with satnav to improve ground-ground accuracy. Not as good as a cruise missile, but good enough to do damage, and they have a massive stockpile of them (likely tens of thousands), so why not use them. Main drawback is the small warhead (144kg) compared to a Tochka-U (482kg) or Iskander (500kg).",1658510932.0,1658510706.0,t3_w50qx0,t1_ih7i5pu,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Ukraine is also fighting a masterful information war. There's a big difference betwen suspecting you are surrounded and screwed and the enemy telling you so, it's a great psychological play.

Ukraine is also doing absolutely everything it can to modernise and be a liberal European democracy and so it is trying to conduct this war with as much openess, transparency and fairness as it perceives it needs to.

And finally, if the troops surrender it's another win for Ukraine, they can treat them properly, feed them and then conduct a prisoner exchange, getting her own people back and then word gets out in Russian units about how easy things go if you surrender, increasing more chances of surrender.

They’ve made minimal progress in the East - they’ve managed to take a couple of small cities in two months at massive costs. Russia has now essentially run out of combat power to advance. They are counting on geopolitical pressures to force Western governments to curtail their support to force Ukraine to the negotiating table. That won’t happen until the fall at the earliest - Ukraine is going to launch a counteroffensive, probably starting in the next few weeks (although that date has been shifting back over the past couple of months). I expect the result of that will determine the course of the rest of the war. If Ukraine wins a significant victory and captures/destroys a chunk of the Russian army west of the Dnipro around Kherson, then I expect the war to continue. Ukraine will try to push across the south to retake Melitopol and threaten Crimea and the flank of the Donbas advance. Now, it’s much harder to play offense than defense.

Believing any article claiming one way or the other at any point in the war is also pointless until the war is over.

Best idea is to not think of the war as winning/losing but in terms of the facts.

Russia is bleeding and paying a very high price for what little ground they were gaining up until recently. Recently they have stopped, because they have attrited themselves so heavily.

Ukraine is running a Defence-in-depth strategy and has very much succeeded at this to date, with some high numbers of casualties in the latest intense fighting in the East.

Ukraine is now in a strategic position to begin advances in the South and South West, but how successful and how quickly they manage this remains to be seen. These upcoming/ongoing offensives until September will largely frame the position both sides are in come winter.

Long term, Ukraine has the advantage as it is being resupplied and trained up on western equipment, Russia relies on large stocks of older gear and has a relative manpower disadvantage (it has not mobilised, Ukraine has).

The summary is that there is still a long road ahead and discussing a complex conventional war with many asymmetrical factors in win-loss terms is oversimplifying the situation.

Everyone's kinda sitting back and waiting to see if Ukraine can or will ever launch an effective counter attack or not with the help of modern western artillery systems and missile batteries.

We are also seeing Ukranians starting to get trained on more Western weapons systems including fighter jets which will allow the Western Military Industrial Complex to supply them basically indefinitely.

On the other side, Russia has the potential to drag this out for a decade if it wished and eventually win a war of attrition.... maybe. Really the war could go on for a very long time if both sides are willing to throw away a generation of young adults into it.

The coming months are going to be telling, if you start to see meaningful movement on the Kherson front while the Donbas front continues its very slow march than I would say Ukraine has the upper hand. If the status-quo persists until the fall than it's stalemate. If Russia manages to actually push significantly out of Donbas, than I'd say Russia has finally retaken the initiative.

A final note I will say is a stalemate is a mixed bag for both parties. While it means Russia can move to integrate occupied territory into their country (legitimately or not), but it also exacerbates their weakness at being unable to decisively defeat Ukraine. Also the longer the war wages the more it weakens Russia as a whole and weakens their influence on Central Asia and even some of the edges of the Russian Federation itself (Chechnya comes to mind as one of many potential provinces that might try again for independence).

Russia was always going to fail to take Ukraine.  Even if Kyiv had been encircled and overrun Moscow would still face a situation much more difficult then Afghanistan.  They failed in Afghanistan too.  As did USA and USA also failed Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq.  

Prior to the invasion there was much doubt whether or not Ukraine would really fight.  Two or three days in there was no room for doubt.  

Battlefields are a whole different category.  There have been many wins and losses.  Historical well studied events are often contorted.  See Britain at Dunkirk for example.  Victoriously withdrew the soldiers.  Succeeded in submerging all the heavy equipment in the channel so the Germans could not use it.   

Ukraine's battle field success was a surprise.  Damage done to Russia was way out of proportion to what can be expected from a smaller force using mostly the same equipment.  

Ukraine has used up it's ammunition, worn down the equipment it had, and Ukraine is still outnumbered in equipment.  Russia has damaged Ukraine's industry so rebuilding during the war is not possible.  If Ukraine were fighting Russia in isolation, without NATO supplies it is unlikely they could avoid getting overrun now. 

There is NATO supplies so no way Russia can sustain a long war.  Now it is just a question of how long it takes to evict Russian forces.  A very broad range of possible blood loss for Ukraine.  A very broad range in how long it takes.  

The final outcome for Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk is still in doubt.  My only doubt though is doubting the value.  There are costs and benefits that Ukraine has to weigh.  Are they just collecting angry residents who will then demand more cost incurred rebuilding?  All of us should defend Ukraine's right to make that judgement.

Because they're expensive to replace. Russia still fields S-300 launchers, so they're the ammunition for the core backbone of the RF's primary anti-air weapon. Sure, maybe Russia has a lot of them, but I'm willing to bet their stores are not half as deep as they think. What's there has probably degraded with neglect, or been stolen, or exploded in a 'smoking' accident. This has been true for literally every piece of equipment the RF fielded to date. 

And what are they using this expensive ammunition for? Terrorizing civilians. Why? Because the missiles lack the yield to penetrate  armored targets nor the accuracy to hit light infantry. 

It all boils down to: Russia expending irreplaceable ammunition on civilian targets for limited military gains in a conflict with an ill-defined end point. They don't know how long this war will last, so they might actually need all of that ammunition. What they're doing is wasting military assets to create domestic headlines.

As much as all sides try to hide the fact, the truth is Russia is one wrong move away form WWIII. The USA and the European nations see Russia as a direct treat because of the invasion.

In his declaration of war against Ukraine, he directly claimed everything under the USSR as belonging to Russia. He made it very clear that he intended to rebuild the Soviet power block with military force.

First, they're no good without trained crews, and even if we were intent on supplying them, there wasn't much point to sending them until there were crews capable of operating them.    
Second, for HIMARS to be useful they need a steady stream or ammo, and that takes a significant slice of logistics capacity to supply.  Earlier in the war we were concerned with making sure the Ukrainians had a steady supply of more basic equipment and weapons to keep up the fight.  Giving them rockets they weren't ready to use took second place to getting them stuff they needed and could use at the moment.  There are only so many planes and ships available for sending stuff at any given time so you're looking at basic prioritization.

Another factor, of course, was the concern over how Russia would react to the escalation of sending high tech long range weapons.  You'll note that we've been slowly ramping up on sending Ukraine equipment that could be used offensively.  Seeing that Russia didn't react in any substantial way to those earlier shipments cleared the way for sending the HIMARS.  
I can agree it would have been great to see them in the field sooner, but I don't have the details to tell me if there was any serious chance of that happening.

We also needed assurances from Ukraine that longer ranged systems would not be used to strike targets far inside of Russia itself.",False,1658491251.0,t3_w50qx0,t1_ih6eg7x,,3,11,0,11,0,0,
bbef3ef31c11db0067b14978965297d4,w50qx0,ih6oqsg,"In addition to the comments below regarding the training and logistical issues, there is the matter of the pre-war assessments about the capability of the Russian armed forces.   I think it would be fair to say that most, if not all of the Western governments and militaries were taking the matter seriously, and had assumed a worst-case scenario was going to unfold.   They were anticipating the rapid advance and fall of Ukraine in rapid order, and had started to assemble what Ukraine would need for active resistance and partisan support.   Yes, in looking at it now, it seemed dumb to underestimate Ukraine's fightback, but it was a serious worry.

When you talk about getting supplies into a theater of operations, you have to be very cognizant of the bottlenecks you'll encounter.  To put it in an analogy, let's think of it like a warehouse.   We have boxes and boxes of stuff in the warehouse, but if the fastest you're going to get those boxes in the truck is down to Tommy and Jim-Bob in shipping and packing, you have to prioritize what goes out first, may it be by priority and need, or any other level of assessment.  If something shifts in that assessment you'll have to plan changing priorities.   You might be able to rope in another person, but if the shipping section is only big enough for two people to work, you're still stuck.  

So lets look at it this way.   With that pre-assessment being pessimistic about Ukraine's chances against a full-blown assault, everyone planning the shipments are thinking in terms of supplies to carry out a guerilla campaign.  So the boxes being queued are going to reflect that.  They stacked what was going out, with those priorities.   However, when it turned out that the Russians combined forces were less a juggernaut, but more like a bunch of full teacups teetering on a tray carried by a waiter on the edge of epileptic seizures, that caused a rethink.   

The Western powers had to work with the Ukrainians on the new gameplan.   Reassess the needs to hold on the battlefield, and plan accordingly.   Basic supplies for troops, then ATGMs and SAMs, which will have the greatest effect as quickly as possible, then everything else.

 That is a big part of this slow rollout.  Theoretically, you'd want all of the stuff where you want it to go to be there tomorrow, but you have to think in the limits that the situation presents itself, and sometimes, that's far from optimal.  Forces like the US military spend hours and billions on making these logistics less of a problem, but they still have teething problems.

Crimea is the least likely of all territory to return to Ukraine because of geopolitical, mililtary and cultural reasons.
