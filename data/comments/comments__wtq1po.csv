Day 179 of my updates from Kharkiv.

There was a lot of shelling today. It started around 9pm with couple MLRS rockets being fired at Kyivskyi district, and then some more being fired again at 10pm, and for the third time at 10:30pm. All 3 times they aimed at the same district, 1 person was injured, but thankfully nobody died. Also they used cluster munitions every time, a cluster rocket was found lying on the ground in the middle of a street almost immediately after shelling.

Then at 2am we had an air raid alert, but nothing followed after it, or rather not immediately. Apparently it was triggered because there was intense fighting just north of Kharkiv, around Tsupivka and Dementiivka. After that, at 2:50am, there were 2 very loud explosions in the city, air raid alert was still active, but no missile launches from Belgorod were reported. A bit later some telegram channels said that we were being hit from Smerch MLRS, with unitary, and not cluster warhead rockets this time.

Now we don’t really know if there will be any missiles fired at us today, as it is already 5am and it still hasn’t happened, unless those 2 explosions were the missile strike. But if it was, then we don’t know where they were launching them from, as it wasn’t from their usual spot, because locals couldn’t see them this time. Usually when they fire their missiles from Belgorod people from Kharkiv oblast and from Belgorod can both see them fly, and depending on their location, some can even see them land in Kharkiv.

And training was already inconsistent in the Russian army to start with before February 24th. Some units could be very well trained and others could be awful depending on the unit, where it was assigned, how well funded it was and the quality of its officers.

Standards were always a problem stretching back to Soviet times where the tendency was to have a select group of soldiers with high standards that are very well equipped and ""the rest"" which made due with older equipment with limited and/or poor training on it. Russia tried to reduce that capability gap and bring more troops up to decent standards in the last 20 years but it's clear based on the overall performance of the army in Ukraine they were very far from succeeding. Inconsistent troop quality has been cited as a huge reason why many overestimated how the Russian army would perform because they saw Russia's best troops in Syria perform decently and although they knew the rest weren't up to that standard they didn't truly understand just how much worse they were.

So the Russian army is going from most soldiers not getting enough training even pre war to a bunch of drunken thugs in their 40's that won't even get the insufficient level discipline and training that those that came before them got.

Reposting my comment, with the English translation of his post. 


I found the full post from Bondarenko. A lot of stuff has been omitted from the tweets above. 

Essentially, this guy is speculating that the claimed “chemical poisoning” reported by Russian authorities, which some suggested may be expired rations, is actually radiation poisoning.

These soldiers were admitted for poisoning several weeks ago (back in late July.) Bondarenko is putting forward his opinion from the symptoms reported in the media, not his first hand experience. So he like many others is saying “we need inspectors in because they might have radiation poisoning and are covering it up.”

So if his theory is true, it seems the Russians were telling fibs and that those soldiers were exposed to radiation, rather than chemicals or poisoning. I’m no nuclear scientist but the fact that it’s been this long since they got sick suggests that if there is a leak (rather than the soldiers just being exposed to radioactive materials in the plant) it probably isn’t a huge one since it hasn’t been detected in the rest of the surrounding area. But that’s just my own speculation. 


TLDR: this is a gut giving his speculative opinion, as a paramedic, on the Russian poisonings that were reported, not actual concrete info that he was given or first hand experience. 


Here’s his full post:

“Russian soldiers, who were on duty at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, were delivered to intensive care with radiation-like signs.

As the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation wrote, ""Russian soldiers who were on missions in the Zaporizhzhya region were taken to a military hospital on July 31."" There were signs of strong poisoning in the military, an investigation found the presence of organic poison of artificial origin. Currently, the Russian military from the nuclear station is in intensive care, they are being investigated by specialists of the Main Research and Research Trial Institute of Military Medicine of Russia.

As far as I can judge, being a paramedic - symptoms that the media write about, can indicate and radiation disease. The Russians, of course, talk about chemical poisoning, but brought the wounded from the nuclear plant. Not to mention at all the level of trust in Russian information. This is about the botoluxin.

Remind you that around this time Russia and Ukraine exchanged mutual charges in the station bombardment. Ukrainian ""Energoatom"" stated a possible radiation leak at the ZAEU. At the same time, Rosatomu specialists removed their staff from the station in an emergency. And inspectors of the magate occupants denied access to the station.

Something similar was last observed in the first month after the Chernobyl disaster. The USSR leadership desperately hid and distorted the truth, leading to catastrophic consequences for both the health and lives of millions of people, and for the Soviet power itself, which did not forgive this lie.

Now, before it's too late, you need to do everything possible to get a true picture of the situation at the station. The station must be demilitarized immediately and put it under the control of the UN, IAEA or some other independent structure. Its a matter of survival.

The level of opportunity of international organizations, more precisely their level of helplessness, but there is no other yet.”",False,1661099391.0,t3_wtq1po,t1_il7j36z,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

A word used when you agree with something; or when you want to recognize someone for being themselves, i.e. courageous and unique or not caring what others think. Especially common in online political slang.

The opposite of cringe, some times the opposite of biased.

The latter usage is the original use as coined by rapper Lil B, and the word originally took off on the meta-ironic website 4Chan with the latter meaning. For that reason the word is largely used meta-ironically (without context you can't tell if it's being used ironically or sincerely as it's used in both ways) and was popularized in online political slang of conservatives and the political right before being adopted into mainstream online political slang (likely through shitposting websites or subreddits such as r/politicalcompass memes that are similar to 4chan in their meta-irony and ""edginess"" but contain a wider variety of political beliefs) and eventually adopted into general online vernacular.

When used in online political language it can mean ""based in fact"" or the opposite of biased due to the number of people who saw it being first used seriously by the online political right and came to the conclusion that is was related to the phrase ""destroyed with facts and logic"" in reference to right wing personality Ben Shapiro.",False,1661115483.0,t3_wtq1po,t1_il8kw6e,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

>If you can't see the significance of this information considering we are talking about region that everyone was expecting Ukraine is the strongest and is about to launch a counter-attack, I don't know what to tell you.

That's exactly right. You don't know. You're not privy to the numerous meetings between officers, the calls between leaders, and all the other communications and preparations that are happening at a high level right now.

Furthermore, the front line in the south has never been static...or has ever gone in only one direction or the other. Its been a back and forth struggle since the war started. The Russians are going to have to push a lot more than one or two kilometers for that status quo of ebb and flow to change at all.


So no that information is not, in fact, significant. Ukraine can ""declare"" an offensive all it wants but it hardly means anything until we either see movement in the line or a lot of dead or captured Ukrainian troops, things which would indicate successful or failed physical advances...of which we've seen neither.

So you've taken the Ukrainians at their word that they starting an offensive in the south...Good! That means the Russians could have too. And from how many troops they threw that direction they certainly seem to have...which Ukraine is now liberally punishing them for by blowing up every strategic target they can possible reach between Kherson and Sevastopol.

Everyone in this thread has chosen to give what they don't know a charitable characterization based on what they assume is true. You, however, would rather give a pessimistic characterization of what you don't know and assume based on incomplete information.

Both of these extrapolations are probably wrong in some way, but don't pretend for a second that your assumptions are more based in reality than others because its a simple fact; we don't know exactly what Ukraine is doing and we don't have a reason to expect them to be forthcoming and honest about it even if they did.",False,1661106706.0,t3_wtq1po,t1_il7t6hn,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

I think the word terrorism has been diluted and don't like this, myself, as it ends up conflating too many things with very different results. Setting of a bomb in a public square is not in the same league as ruining a research project ostensibly to show compassion to our animal friends (and they certainly are *my* friends, FWIW). Killing an enemy in an (adjunct) declared (by the manifesto) war is not the same as killing a man symbolically because he is Jewish. 

Yes the terms do end up blurring, but I still would not call this an act of terrorism, but rather targeted killing. Call it murder or don't, again fair enough, but it yes is killing but no is not terrorism.

Being at war with the US and bombing the Pentagon (by air/missile/carbomb/whatever) would be fine.

Let me be clear. Attacks against inocent civilians or persons protected by the geneva convention (army medics for example) are terrorism. 

Reckless attacks against ""valid"" targets that cause unreasonable civilian casualties are borderline terrorism, because let's be honest, no weapon is perfect and collateral damage still exists, but only up to a point.

If a russian S300/400 unit can't take out a HARM, then NATO could quickly knock out all of Russia's air defenses in a war.  An S400 in particular HAS to be able to defend itself against HARM because if it can't, its pretty useless in a conflict against a country that has them.

And as I said it's certainly debatable if they offer much of an advantage over using commercial drones for the cost but that is different than saying they were useless. If they worked as intended and tended to hit their targets I would wager the Ukrainian troops  that used them that day found them very, very useful even if they might have preferred a commercial drone for reusability.

Also your source says that ""*some units* preferred to use commercial drones rigged with explosives that are more user friendly."" That doesn't say they were useless or could not do what they were supposed too. Your linked article also seems to cast doubt on Ukraine's ability to use any western equipment. It casts it all in a negative light including HIMARS which they have clearly used with great success. It's always good to be honest about the challenges but as written it's just a very negative outlook focusing on the problems instead of the clear successes that have happened and it doesn't contain nearly enough detail to know what the success rate of the switchblades were and whether those other units not included in the ""some units"" used them just fine.

So I'm not saying that switchblades are better than commercial drones cost wise or for other reasons but that does not mean they are useless, are not better for certain types of missions or that many Ukrainian soldiers were perfectly happy to have a switchblade to use if the alternative that day was to have no drone at all.

His work focuses on Russian information operations, the Kremlin’s campaigns in Ukraine and Belarus, and Ukrainian politics. George received his B.A. with Honors in International Relations and Global Studies with a concentration in Russian and Post-Soviet Studies - what does he say?

Oh yes, he says Dugin is irrelevant essentially.    
    
""from my own discussions with Russian scholars, academic discussions on this field within Russia do not fixate on Dugin, but instead focus on mainstream names in international relations theory: Hans Morgenthau, John Mearsheimer, Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukuyama, Joseph Nye, etc.— Dugin is not really included amongst their ranks.""    
    
Stop over-simplifying the situation. Dugin is just a useful weirdo on the Russian foreign policy scene, akin to Alex Jones. You can still believe he's the big policy god you seem to think he is, and I'll listen to people like Kofman & Barros.",False,1661103148.0,t3_wtq1po,t1_il7edog,,4,-1,0,-1,0,0,
