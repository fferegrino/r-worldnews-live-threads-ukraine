I'm still seeing a lot of people giving the ""NATO pushed them to this!"" argument. That's BS. Nor has Putin gone insane. From the point of view of an authoritarian Russian ruler, this invasion makes perfect sense and would have always happened sooner or later.


He just bit off more than he could chew and is now desperately scrambling. Maybe the crap he pulls now is irrational because he's literally choosing between being screwed and being boned, but everything leading up to it was perfectly predictable, if cruel.


1. Demographically, Russia is dying due to low birth rates. COVID only made this worse. Not to mention this current generation are the direct descendants of the unlucky famine/WW2 generation where 80% of men died, i.e. the dip in the population pyramid. He has to make the most of the military now before his current pool of able-bodied men ages out.
&#10;  

2. Russia has always had 2 objectives: warm water ports, and securing their flank on the Great European Plain, one of the least defensible geographical structures on earth. (Ever wonder why Poland kept getting kicked around all throughout history? Their land is composed of nothing but this giant plain.) He's not just trying to bring back the Soviet era for nostalgia's sake -- back then, the border of the USSR + eastern bloc allies stretched all the way to East Germany, which is where the narrowest chokepoint of this plain is.
&#10;  

3. However, most of those countries have now joined NATO. This is why Ukraine is so central to Russian foreign policy. If Ukraine stays on Russia's side as they were with Zelensky's predecessor, then they greatly narrow the ""gap"" of the plain they have to defend, plus they get the Carpathians as a natural border. If Ukraine becomes EU-aligned, though, suddenly this border grows twice as big to defend, which is disadvantageous for Russia.
&#10;  

4. In addition, part of the only reason why Russia remains relevant in the modern day, given their shrinking population and tiny economy, is the fact that they are Europe's biggest oil supplier. Oil makes up ~50% of their budget. As long as they are Europe's sole petrostate, they have some say. But, they might have a challenger for that spot, and guess who it is? That's right, Ukraine. Oh, and you know where Ukraine's biggest deposits are? Crimea and Donbas. (edit: going to add in stuff like water rights, Ukraine's black soil, controlling 25% of the world's whest production, etc. -- point is control of Ukraine will make him very wealthy indeed.)
&#10;  

5. Therefore Putin stirring up trouble in those separatist breakaway states kills 3 birds with one stone. a) Initial setups for oil drilling is expensive, so as long as Ukraine is distracted by those conflicts, they won't have the startup capital to be meaningful competition for the ""Europe #1 Oil Sheikh"" position. b) Taking over Crimea and Donbas will even further cement Russia's oil and other resource capabilities. c) Keeping Ukraine destabilized makes it harder for them to join NATO and the EU which is in line with the European Plain thing; see points #2 and #3.
&#10;  

6. And sure, the whole Russia+Belarus+Ukraine thing, one great unified Eastern Slav Rus people, just like it was in the good old days of the Tsars and USSR, might play into it somewhat. ""We all used to be one country, one people, and we belong together."" Ignoring the fact that Ukraine doesn't want it any more than Austria-Hungary want to reform their empire.
&#10;  

7. Given all these great reasons why Putin should want Ukraine under Russia's thumb, and Zelensky not cooperating the way his predecessor did, the only question remains: why *shouldn't* Putin strongarm his way into getting what he wants? NATO had historically shown itself to be quiet when he invaded Georgia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014. For those of you asking ""Did Putin really think he could just stroll into Ukraine that easily?"" the answer is YES, BECAUSE HE ALREADY DID. And the world did NOTHING!
&#10;  

8. Well, ""the world did nothing"" is not strictly true. For eight years the US + allies have been helping Ukraine modernize their military (training, money, supplies, ammo). A lot has changed and the military of Ukraine in 2022 is a far cry from what it was in 2014. And let's be real, no one saw Zelensky coming. It's very rare to see a head of state with such protagonist energy -- literally everyone else he's ever come up against, in the same situation, Biden, Trump, Xi, Lukashenko, Putin himself, would have fled and accepted Western asylum, leaving Kyiv without resistance. But from Putin's point of view, Ukraine has always been ""Little Rus"". So he had no reason to believe they wouldn't cave the way they did back in 2014 even as the KGB probably told him about all the javelins that fell off a truck. 
&#10;  

9. So now we have the situation. Russia wants defensible borders and protection of its biggest industry. Therefore they need Russia-friendly regime in Kyiv. They've been testing the waters since 2008 and all went well. Sure, the West has been helping Ukraine but they can't have improved *that* much. And what are they going to do, more sanctions? No, the world will turn a blind eye like they did in 2008 and 2014. So we march in quickly, Ukraine will give up because they are small country vs. big strong Russian bear reputation, Zelensky and cabinet will flee because they always do, and install a puppet ruler before EU bureaucrats have time for anything more than symbolic sanctions and posturing. Remember, Germany hadn't folded and accepted the sanctions / SWIFT thing until day 3 or so. And don't tell the conscripts what they're doing until they already crossed the border, because we expect no actual combat to take place and secrecy matters more (remember, they are trying to do a quick coup before anyone else in the EU even realizes what happened).
&#10;  

10. Based on his prior experiences and knowledge it's clear why Putin thought he could get away with this whole, ah, ""peaceful military operation"". It was not insanity (cruelty and idiocy sure, but not insanity), merely miscalculation in 4 parts: a) underestimated the Ukrainian resolve / training / equipment, b) underestimated the incompetence and corruption rife in the Russian military, c) did not expect Biden administration to literally call him out on his bullshit at every step of the way, d) not understanding the power of social media making this the most well documented / shitposted / viral war in human history + the internet sending information faster than planes can fly = viral outrage uniting the world against a common foe. (edit: Good point from one of the comments -- the response is especially vitriolic because the globe has spent the last couple of years bored and pissed off at COVID lockdowns. It's a steam kettle waiting to explode and Putin just happened to be the one to set it off.)
&#10;  

11. And now that he's crossed the Rubicon -- well, Dnieper -- he has no choice but to double down. If he folds, he loses face, gets overthrown, and definitely dies. If he presses forward, he might still die as his oligarchs turn on him and the country revolts en masse, but there is also a chance that he gets what he came for, albeit at a far greater cost than he ever imagined. Grind Ukraine under his boot for their gall to resist him, show his internal detractors that he is still strong and not to be messed with. So what if the Western Empire of Lies has seized all of his and the oligarchs' stuff? He's still Tsar of the Hill in Russia; his own countrymen may starve under the weight of the sanctions, but he won't. Sure his shiny toys got taken away and just holding Ukraine will bleed Moscow's coffees dry in a few years, but he doesn't have long for this world and dying comfortably of old age in his mansion is better than being assassinated. Option A: less bad for Russia and Ukraine, catastrophic for me. Option B: catastrophic for Russia and Ukraine, less bad for me. Well, someone like him picks Option B every time.


Sad thing is Russia did have so much potential. Putin's early years were quite hopeful: he pulled the country away from anarchy after Yeltsin failed, the economy was growing, and there were talks about forming closer ties with the rest of Europe and NATO. They could used their oil for the common good like Norway, before diversifying into tech or industry -- Russia's computer geeks are some of the world's best, but they're either wasted hacking for the government or otherwise brain drain to the West for better pay and benefits.

16af88aa7c97408a5f78240330d56769,t4e9ng,hyy272n,"**Tactical breakdown of the current situation in Ukraine**

The Russian army attempted a blitzkrieg (lightning war) that slowly turned into a badly planned siege. This is because a blitzkrieg requires fast moving divisions to move rapidly into the war zone one after another in quick succession. This didn’t happen because of [Rasputitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasputitsa) aka Mud General which is thick mud and marsh like conditions caused by the poor drainage of underlying clay-laden soils found in this region.  Because of this Russia was forced to keep all of their equipment on roads leading to the 40 mile pileup we see now. The high temperatures causing this are likely to continue for at least the next few weeks. This “caravan” is less of a threat and more of a display of Putins failures.

The most difficult part of these sort of maneuvers is logistics. Heck, the majority of “the art of war” is about logistics behind feeding and supplying an army. Putin is not much of a war general, with essentially no experience at it. He kept all of his plans a secret even from his own generals, which meant that they were never prepared for what he had in mind (or possibly just decided impulsively). They were probably even burning precious fuel and munitions during the fake training exercises.

To supply an army you have to build your own Amazon.com level logistics or have your men live off the land via stolen food/fuel/munitions which is not an option here. They’re stuck on a single road in many cases and have no way to supply the front of the caravan. Supplying them with air transport will also be essentially impossible.

At this point the most likely scenario is that yes, eventually Russia will take key cities like Kyiv. But this will mean very little. Because of their desperate tactics and brutality, they’ve only strengthened the resolve of Ukraine and the rest of the free world. Like the saying (likely incorrectly) attributed to Yamamoto after Pearl Harbor “I fear we have awakened a sleeping giant and filled it with a terrible resolve” in reference to U.S. war industry, it now applies well to Ukraine’s supply of financing, manpower and weaponry. Further, Russia can no longer even produce munitions due to supply shortages caused by sanctions.

Much of the equipment Russia is sending is on a one way trip. Very soon it will be without fuel or ammunition, let alone food to feed its troops.

Eventually the Russians will have to turn tail and run, leaving behind all of this equipment. It will become something of a self-fulfilling prophecy for Putin in that Ukraine will suddenly have a very impressive amount of equipment and be a member of the EU which is like backdoor membership to NATO. He has single-handedly created the enemy he was previously only pretending existed.

From there we’re likely to enter into a very high tension Cold War with Russia as Putin escalates his nuclear threats out of fear and desperation. The likelihood of him even being able to launch a significant number of these weapons is only going to decrease over time as Russia devolves into bankruptcy and runaway inflation.

Aside from Putin launching these weapons, one of the biggest threats will be the possible sale and proliferation of Russian nuclear weapons to other countries as their economy and military eventually break down. Even the engineers and scientists themselves who work on these weapons are a threat as they sell their services to other bidders.",False,1646161054.0,t3_t4e9ng,t3_t4e9ng,,0,57,0,57,0,0,

I think there is something that many people around the world are missing. There is an implication currently happening with the type of coordination and cooperation the world is experiencing against Russia. While it is awful that we haven't put boots on the ground in Ukraine (for obvious reasons), the actions of NATO, EU, and UN almost as a whole is monumental.

Only 2-3 short years ago the US had a leader who wanted out of NATO and international ties were incredibly fragile. However the actions of one despot brought the world together in a manner not seen since World War 2. Yes it's not perfect and the day is not won. Ukraine is fighting a hard battle and many countries are doing what they can to support them.

But if the best situation happens as a result of this entire horrible conflict not only will we see the potential fall of an Oligarchy, we will see the rise of a new EU/NATO nation (Ukraine), the tightening of ties within the EU and NATO, and the growth of international relations no one has ever seen in their life time. The type of ties and relations our world needs to fight larger looming disasters such as Climate Change.

While I realize it may be foolishly optimistic, and the next couple years have me pessimistic, the following decades may actually be something remarkable for humanity.

In essence it is a light version of an inter-continental version of the EU. The BRICS states even have their own ""Central Bank"", the New Development Bank, which was founded to fund various projects in the member states 

_Note: BRICS association could be one reason why countries like India or China have tried to remain relatively neutral in the Ukraine crisis_

#• CSTO - Collective Security Treaty Organization

The CSTO is a eurasian military alliance which consists of former soviet union states. It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4908644/

#• Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

Speaking in an interview with CNN and Reuters, Zelenskiy said:

It’s necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table.

Zelenskiy urged Nato members to impose a no fly zone to stop the Russian air force.

This is not about dragging NATO countries into war. The truth is everyone has long since been dragged into war and definitely not by Ukraine, but by Russia - a large-scale war is going on.

On Nato membership, he said:

Our partners, if they are not ready to take Ukraine into NATO ... because Russia does not want Ukraine to be in NATO, should work out common security guarantees for Ukraine.

This means that we have our territorial integrity, that our borders are protected, we have special relations with all our neighbours, we are completely safe, and the guarantors that give us security, they guarantee this legally.

Fuel, food (including potable water), and add maintenance to round out the ""big three"" of logistics areas a unit absolutely cannot fail in order to move.

Let's say a tank goes down for any reason (engine, transmission, tracks, etc). If they can't fix it on the spot with their mobile maintenance capabilities, that vehicle needs to be recovered to a rear assembly area to be fixed. That is a huge pain, but normally while the recovery is happening the rest of the unit can bypass the broken vehicles. One a road, however? You're causing more of a traffic jam. And now you need to drag these tanks one at a time on the same road in the opposite direction 40+ miles to your assembly area.

It's very predictable and normal for even the most advanced units (like mine in the US Army) to have multiple tanks AND their recovery vehicles down. However, the way we train and fight is spread out over terrain, so it doesn't hinder the adjacent unit's operations. On a straight highway... this is how you get fuel/maintenance failures and equipment trying to move both ways around eachother resulting in a massive cluster.

To the people worried about the 17 or 40 mile convoy or why the Ukrainian's haven't taken it back... The Ukrainian Army doesn't have a ton of military hardware that could strike all 17 or 40 miles although they have some. But that convoy will have a bunch of Anti-Air with it. They aren't that equipped like other nations with large Air Forces.  
  
HOWEVER at no time in history was it a good idea to have a single file line in an active attack against a hostile force. One of the first battles we know about, Battle of Thermopylae, which the movie ""300"" is based off of shows that having a choke point is bad when you have a numbers advantage.

You'd have two choices - refuse the order and at worse be killed for insubordination, at best it's a catalyst for a coup overthrowing Putin for being that insane.

Putin is doing this in part because the Russian military is currently very exposed. Seventy-five percent of all Russian forces immediately available are involved in Ukraine. They are also mired in heavy resistance and fighting without air supremacy.

What does that mean? If a large military with strong air superiority (NATO, EU, US Forces) engaged their conventional forces in Ukraine they could likely expose them to defeat in detail (or just simple annihilation).

Essentially, from a strategic perspective, 75% of Russia's armed forces in Ukraine, nearly 50% of its entire ground force, are currently vulnerable to complete destruction if NATO attacks. The only option they would have in a practical way to defend against this would be at least tactical nuclear strikes.

But even that might be of limited use (there are a lot of NATO bases, and mobile US carriers are very difficult to ""hit"" with nukes). So that leaves him with the possible necessity of strategic nuclear strikes to defend those forces.

Now would Russia actually be vulnerable with a large portion of its conventional military destroyed? No, it simply has enough strategic options to prevent any invasion ever (and end the entire world). But it would be the death of Putin and his regime if it happened. And he'd be willing to take the world with him.

But that could be a diplomatic coup for the US, no? Court Indian support?

India probably has some buyers remorse for that Russian gear they bought, since Ukraine is turning much of it to junk. And I’d imagine  the Anglosphere & EU could sell some fertilizer to India, picking up the slack in exchange for dropping Russian products. And India isn’t a good friend to China, so shpporting a prospective Yuan backed currency bloc (which Russia might have to do) could be detrimental to their own financial growth ‘cuz that would peg them to Beijing’s influence.

Adding in Pakistani support of the Taliban and harboring bin Laden, plus the previous thoughts, a shift to India makes some sense to me. I also figured Biden picked Harris in part to signal his prospective support to India against China. So with Pakistan and China on their borders, and Russia’s government proving they’re hostile as fuck, I’m curious what Biden has been saying to Modi lately.

Obviously I’m not a geopolitical genius. I’m just curious how China, India, Brazil, Finland, Switzerland, and other nations have reacted to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reports are China is evacuating their nationals from UA, and several Chinese academics have condemned the invasion (only to be censored, per BBC).

Russian and Donetsk troops cut off Ukrainian access to the Sea of Azov. Deputy Head of the DPR People's Militia Department Eduard Basurin said that two humanitarian corridors will be organized for the residents of Mariupol, along which it will be possible to leave the city until Wednesday.

The forces of the Lugansk People's Republic, according to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, have advanced more than 60 km since the beginning of the operation, and they have overcome 19 km over the past day.

In the afternoon, the military department warned of strikes with high-precision weapons on technological facilities of the SBU and the 72nd main center for information and psychological operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kyiv and called on city residents living ""near relay nodes"" to leave their homes. Later it became known that television broadcasting stopped in the Ukrainian capital.

The number of disabled military infrastructure facilities of Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, reached 1,325 (on Monday evening it was reported about 1,146). In addition, according to Konashenkov, almost 400 tanks and armored vehicles and about 240 units of artillery and multiple launch rocket systems were destroyed.

Earlier, the ministry announced losses among the participants in the operation, but did not give details.

If the system detects nuclear missiles coming towards Russia it sends signal to briefcases and bunkers. If none answer in time the system launches nukes to predetermined locations. There is no confirmation if this system is active today but there is high chance it is.

It seems like he was a critical figure in the decades before this crisis - the opportunity Russia had for a leader in Ukraine that would bring Ukraine into the post-Soviet fold who instead screwed up a bunch and drove the country toward the West.

Imagine if it were public knowledge that George W. Bush had personally ordered the police to kill Dan Rather and his decapitated corpse was found in the Potomac river. It's hard to believe that if you do stuff like that as the leader of a country the people of that country are going to be super-receptive to being friends with your friends on an ongoing basis.

Then once things have deteriorated to the point of poisoning the new president of a country it seems hard to believe you really have a decent case for them to want to be in your sphere of influence anymore at all.

Then you show up demanding that your countries have always been friends and call the people currently running it - the people you voted to replace the guy who was decapitating people in the street and who also tanked the economy - all these awful names. Of course they're not going to be receptive.

Lots of people who are talking about NATO as a cause here should instead look at Ukrainian domestic politics in the post-Soviet era.

All it takes is one armed civilian to take a shot at the Russians, and that entire crowd is getting it.

You end up with a [Bloody Sunday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)) style event.

I’m not saying Zelenskyys decision to arm the population is wrong, I’m just saying it needs to be one or the other.

Why was the ability to see up/downvotes removed several days ago? I vividly recall seeing a live thread posted, with a comment with a video spreading disinformation about how, “Russia won’t invade - they already achieved their goals, nerds!” Upon that comment being horrendously downvoted, a new live thread was posted where suddenly up/downvotes were no longer visible. Iirc, that post had only been active 15 minutes.

The hiding of up/downvotes actively contributes to the spread of misinformation by making it seem like blatant disinformation is as valid as those refuting it or - worse - making it seem like a petty argument. This act has had a *significant* effect on the quality of these threads and the community’s ability to call out trolls of all stripes.

Why was this done? Why hasn’t this been directly addressed? Is there a rational explanation for this that isn’t apparent? It’s doing demonstrable harm by muddying the waters of what people *actually* think - it demands an answer from the mods.",False,1646161113.0,t3_t4e9ng,t3_t4e9ng,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

A Soviet army is marching through a Finnish forest when a general hears a voice from over a hill shout: ""one Finnish soldier is better than 10 Soviet soldiers!"" 

The general promptly send 10 soldiers to root out the voice, there is gunfire, and then silence.

After a few minutes, the voice shouts defiantly: ""One Finnish soldier is better than a hundred Soviet soldiers!!"" 

The general sends a hundred men to remove the nuisance, there is a racket of gunfire, and then quiet.

The voice crys out loudly once more: ""One Finnish soldier is better than a *thousand* Soviet soldiers!!"" 

Enraged, the general sends a thousand men charging over the hilltop to shut up that voice once and for all, an epic battle rages, and then quiet. After a few minutes, a gravely wounded Soviet crawls back over the hill and crys:

There is a reality to it that there is a part of the Ukrainian Forces that shows signs of “neo nazism”. And they are hardcore Ukrainian nationalist. They were very much active during the Crimea invasion. 

However, the flip side of this is that Putin has essentially made a mountain out of this molehill, and is hoping ppl think the entire UA is full of neo nAzis, which is not true.

(Media has reported that before the invasion Putin asked the military leadership their opinions. Anyone who said ""don't invade"" was shot.)

Putin himself has no experience with actual war, just running CIA style limited operations. And he got rid of anyone who did. And now he's facing the consequences.

But TLDR from my head

- Generally armored columns move about 50km to 70km per day on a good day. So Russia's been progressing at that pace up until the ""tactical pause"". 

- Russia had known shortage or Ural trucks which are essentially the worker Bees of their supply lines

- Russia's mission in Ukraine was to take Kyiv quickly and avoid having to kill a lot of people knowing the conflict was going to be unpopular at home and abroad. That meant light armor units vulnerable to UA sprinted ahead of main force and ran out of gas. Bad idea.

- Russian army is built and trained to get air superiority, level everything with artillery and then roll in. They're not trained or equipped to do other stuff and they tried to do other stuff. So their supply line equipment and tactics don't match what they're doing. 

- what were seeing happening with the indiscriminate bombing is what the RF's military is good at.

Maybe Russia ends up expanding or solidifying their current holds in southern and eastern Ukraine, restore fresh water to Crimea (which will reduce chances Crimea may revolt and jeopardize their naval base and Black Sea oil rights), and perhaps get the fees reduced on the oil and gas that pass through Ukraine from Russia?

Russia's propaganda network could certainly spin all that as a worthwhile win, provided Russia can get the recent sanctions lifted by pulling or giving back in exchange whatever other areas of Ukraine they occupy.

Russia won't get Ukraine at the rate things are going currently, but unless Ukraine renounces claim over Crimea and the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine will never be permitted into NATO. I'd be surprised if Ukraine could even get into the EU without renouncing those claims either. That's another short-term propaganda victory for Russia if the sanctions get mostly lifted in order to bring about peace, etc... while also getting Ukraine to eventually recognize Russia's claim over Crimea and eastern Donbas region (and anything else Russia can weld to those areas in the meantime). Russia will get Ukraine to recognize all of that land along with their claims over all the resources in those economic areas, even if it means Ukraine joins NATO in the long-term. Putin just needs to survive in the short-term after this blundered attempt at taking Ukraine as a whole.

The only way Russia can decisively lose even in the eyes of his domestic brainwashed constituents is if Ukraine can push Russia out of the country, and back up into Crimea and the eastern Donbas region (they won't be able to take back Russian defensive regions, IMO), WHILE the world maintains the recent sanctions and restrictions for months to come.

I (someone who knows nothing about anything) think the Russian strategy is still to try and take Kyiv as quickly as they can, so they can stop the bleeding, replace the government, get it to sign their ""peace treaty"", and Putin can recall troops calling it a win. They tried doing it very quickly at first, and that was a complete mess. So now they are taking their time, but I don't think this slower move is an indication of a long-term siege.

> In January 2019, the percentage of Russians trusting the president hit a then-historic minimum – 33.4%.[470] It declined further to 31.7% in May 2019[471] which led to a dispute between the VCIOM and President's administration office, who accused it of incorrectly using an open question, after which VCIOM repeated the poll with a closed question getting 72.3%.[472] Nonetheless, in April 2019 Gallup poll showed a record number of Russians (20%) willing to permanently emigrate from Russia.[473] The decline is even larger in the 17–25 age group, ""who find themselves largely disconnected from the country's aging leadership, nostalgic Soviet rhetoric and nepotistic agenda"", according to a report prepared by Vladimir Milov. The percentage of people willing to emigrate permanently in this age group is 41% and 60% has favorable views on the United States (three times more than in the 55+ age group).[474] Decline in support for president and the government is also visible in other polls, such as rapidly growing readiness to protest against poor living conditions.[472]
> 
> In May 2020, amid the COVID-19 crisis, Putin's approval rating was 67.9%, measured by VCIOM when respondents were presented a list of names (closed question),[475] and 27% when respondents were expected to name politicians they trust (open question).[476] In a closed-question survey conducted by Levada, the approval rating was 59%[477] which has been attributed to continued post-Crimea economic stagnation but also an apathetic response to the pandemic crisis in Russia.[478] In another May 2021 Levada poll, 33% indicated Putin in response to ""who would you vote for this weekend?"" among Moscow respondents and 40% outside of Moscow.[479] The Levada Center survey released in October 2021 found 53% of respondents saying they trusted Putin.[480]
> 
> Polls conducted in November 2021 on the wake of failure of Russian COVID-19 vaccination campaign indicated that distrust of Putin personally are one of the major contributing factor for vaccine hesitancy among citizens, with regional polls indicating numbers as low as 20–30% in Volga Federal District.[481] 

Imagine how fucking low it is now.

**And a bonus quote:**

> **""After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as ""manual management"" as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability.""**

Propaganda is powerful but it takes a constant application and is expensive. Propaganda is far weaker though, because one simple disseminating truth can unravel years of propaganda. Or just one lie exposed — such as the Ukrainian action not being a war- can render all Russian propaganda moot.  

Another problem for propaganda-reliant governments is that the citizens who believe the propaganda are disadvantaged to reality, to what is actually happening. Citizens misinformed like this are at a huge disadvantage in the world’s business in our Information Age, 21st century. 

Morale of a propaganda-reliant nation’s troops will always be inferior to those defending their homes from foreign invasion.

But Russia’s proved that even if they get Ukraine they’re not going to win because their economy is in shambles and they can’t be trusted to make smart decisions anymore. China’s economy is also not stagnating like Russia’s has been, so there’s less motivation for them to make a colossally reckless decision.

Also, China is less of a loose cannon because they want to keep their economic growth, and if they invade Taiwan they definitely want to keep their semiconductor industry. So nukes are off the table for everyone in that situation.

Most people don't have real access to independent or western media - you have to know what you are looking for and/or know foreign language rather well. Current administration made it pretty hard on both ends. Eradicating opposition was name of the game for past 10+ years.

What else would you call the entire globe sanctioning and financially crippling an entire country (Russia) with a high probability of Russia using counter measures via cyber attacks, etc.? So no, it’s not “world war” in the sense of how it was in early/mid 20th century, but it’s surely a global conflict and way more nuanced than your presumed narrow definition of a “world war.”  Moreover, one NATO plane downed by the Russians or something to that effect would immediately trigger an even larger scale global war/conflict.

Russia is already threatening to use nuclear missiles if their invasion of another country is challenged.

The frustrating answer is: ""Probably, yes."" NATO Naval Forces are always trying to track Russian (and other potential adversaries) submarine movements. ***Especially*** nuclear-armed submarines. They do this via a wide range of activities ranging from attack submarines camping outside Russian naval bases and trying to detect Russian submarines slipping out of the barn so to speak and following them (in laymans terms) to technically complicated systems like [SOSUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS) which is a network of underwater sonar devices monitoring a strategically vital gap that Russian Submarines passing into the Atlantic would have to go through called the GIUK gap: (G)reenland, (I)celand, (UK).

These systems are not foolproof. It's possible they could be evaded (and Russian Submarine Captains will try very hard to do that) but for close to 70 years... NATO Naval forces have a pretty good track record of keeping tabs on Russian missile subs. 

>Do they always know where the Russian subs are or is there any chance of a surprise attack if shit hit the fan?

As stated above, in theory, they like to think that they do but it's always a possibility (however, I think it is more remote) that Russian naval forces might slip through. The second part of the deterrence mission is the fact that we ***also*** have missile boats out there loaded to the teeth with SLBM's and hundreds of warheads. The same way we are always trying to track their submarines, they are always trying to track ours. And if we can't be totally sure we know where all theirs are... they, likewise, can't be so sure they know where all of ours are. The idea that a couple of Ohio class submarines might be unaccounted for (each with 288 independently targettable nuclear weapons) is a big deterrent to allowing one of your Subs who has slipped loose to launch the first strike. 

>How big would a hypothetical blast radius from a nuclear hit from a submarine? If one hit Halifax, would all of Nova Scotia be fucked for example?

The surprising answer here is: not as big as you think it would be. It depends on a huge variety of factors: airburst or groundburst? Weapons yield? Environmental factors like wind speed, direction, etc. But the surprising reality is most civilians badly over-estimate the destructive power of nuclear weapons (Ex: a single warhead hitting Halifax would ***not*** devastate all of Nova Scotia even though it would be a terrible event)

What is known is that the us is very good at anti sub warfare.  Microphones placed on the sea floor, attack subs to hunt other subs, navy Poseidon aircraft and helicopters to also hunt and kill subs.  Anti sun warfare has been a backbone of defense strategy since the Cold War. There is always a chance because it takes one to slip by but it’s a moot point because they won’t attack the us.  

Second question see the above answer and then google operation crossroads.  A 1940s test on how the bomb would impact the navy.  Surface detonations had less affects on surface ships than they thought it would but the ships were completely contaminated with radiation.  The also learned, An underwater nuclear explosion could take an aircraft carrier and throw it 100 yards.   The test ended in an ecological disaster after the underwater test.  I’d imagine a surface detonation would have little effect on a fully submerged sub based on those tests.  

It’s also worth noting that one of the largest focuses of the navy is anti submarine warfare and that it’s also some of the most classified information and capabilities.  A great Intro to what subs do is the  “smarter every day” YouTube channel and his series where the navy invites him onto a sub in the Arctic.

2) The U.S. and NATO are not going to take any action--like invading Russia--that would justify a nuclear reaction.

3) Of course we all lose in a nuclear war, but Russia really loses.  Based on our knowledge of Russia's nuclear arsenal, we'd likely be able to intercept quite a bit of it and minimize losses in the West, and likely in the U.S..  Russia would likely cease to exist. Why does that matter? Because it's an even stronger deterrent to Russia launching such an attack.

No court, body, etc, has any relevance if it cannot enforce its laws. The UN is not a military - it has peacekeepers provided to it by participating nations. They are a piddling force compared to the kind of military power at play here. 

Sanctions are all anyone can do unless a more powerful military force, i.e. NATO or a NATO member, or China, or someone is willing to step in and defend. However, the very real consequences of that decision could mean nuclear war.

NATO has chosen, wisely, not to get involved as they - probably rightfully - assume that Russia would declare that an act of war and deploy the only option it has for fighting the combined forces of NATO: nuclear retaliation.

Sanctions are the more humane option by far. Due process and civil liberties arent granted to citizens of other countries. For an example of this, see: Russia bombing Ukraine for existing. In a state of war, the ends dont automatically justify the means, but they often can. Again, human rights, civil liberties, etc... all those things are subject to a stable environment that has been freed from the ""natural law of might makes right."" Global armed conflict aint that.

 >The Winter War, also known as First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II; the war ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

My view is that he does not want a democracy next door that has close ethnic and family ties to Russia.  They might inspire change in Russia.

He's already had a lot of NATO expansion next door and complained so maybe he is serious about not wanting Ukraine in NATO.

But the natural gas story is not new.  Crimea and the Black Sea area within Ukraine's EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) are worth a lot.  There are also pipelines that cross Ukraine which Russia has to pay to use.

Like if we take a look at countries, such as the US, where the government of the time ended up being relatively transparent in their corruption, using insider info for selling stock, looting PPE supplies, stealing relief loans, etc. and the downplaying of the loss of life impact of the virus with more ""truer"" numbers coming out. Then compare that to Russia which even on the public side of things was doing at least this if not worse, and you have to assume based upon the relative normal levels of corruption in Russian government that it was even worse than we could ever know. 

As well, it is probably accurate to assume that along with the corruption there has been plenty of nepotism, which again looking at Trump trying to make the US Russia Jr. and absolutely following Putin's playbook (as much as he was able to anyway) means that competency and skills likely are missing from positions which really do require high levels of both to be effective as we have seen in the US with the little time Trump was in office comparatively. I think the Trump years in the US did a lot to give us an insight into at least the framework of how Russia government operates due largely to Trump being unable to keep anything on the down low. 

This isn't to say that Russia still isn't a powerful threat, but I think the kleptocratic culture of Russian government at all levels where personal enrichment is above all else is coming to a head now. It was probably easy for them in the past to kick the can down the road because Russia only needed to present itself as a military powerhouse but never needed to truly back it up in recent years and I think that is being reflected in this war. I believe a key indicator of this is how woefully unprepared and outdated their supply and support tools are. Granted better stuff could be held back but I doubt it, I think its far more likely that for many years now Russia has only prioritized expensive (and thus small quantity) and impressive tools of war to put up a tougher front than they actually have, which I think is also supported by them changing focus to cyber warfare which is extraordinarily cheap for the return on investment. I think they now are the wizard of oz and desperately don't want anyone to peak behind the current. 

All of that being said it doesn't really matter, this is still a disgusting pointless war where the youth are being sacrificed because of old assholes' greed and obsession with lines on a map. And my only hope is that this all works out soon in Ukraine's favor and will make the large imperialist countries (US, China, etc.) think twice about bullying smaller countries, particularly when there is so much more to be gained by toeing the economic disparity line while maintaining stability.",False,1646162209.0,t3_t4e9ng,t1_hyxxzan,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/us/politics/energetic-bear-russian-hackers.html
Cybersecurity officials watched with growing alarm in September as Russian state hackers started prowling around dozens of American state and local government computer systems just two months before the election.
The act itself did not worry them so much — officials anticipated that the Russians who interfered in the 2016 election would be back — but the actor did. The group, known to researchers as “Dragonfly” or “Energetic Bear” for its hackings of the energy sector, was not involved in 2016 election hacking. But it has in the past five years breached the power grid, water treatment facilities and even nuclear power plants, including one in Kansas.
It also hacked into Wi-Fi systems at San Francisco International Airport and at least two other West Coast airports in March in an apparent bid to find one unidentified traveler, a demonstration of the hackers’ power and resolve.

It feeds war hawks, and props up an entire defense industry based on the need to maintain not just military parity, but outright dominance in order to contain this influence.  
  
Like it or not, the US and NATO would have a much harder time justifying these levels of military spending without these antagonists.  And evidence suggests that were China and Russia fall into line, they would be no more subjugated on the global stage than Germany and Japan have been.

Or he may blame the outcome on Western financial support of Ukraine, or threaten use of nukes if sanctions are not walked back.

Our only assured path away from MAD is if Putin continues to act rationally, and a Nato push to defend Ukraine might just be his best off ramp. 

If we push to defend Ukrainian civilians, don't directly engage Russian troops, provide plenty of warning, and dangle sanction relief upon Russian withdrawal.. that might be a way to allow Putin to salvage his conventional army, blame the withdrawal on Nato interference instead of issues with the armies poor performance, start saving face with the oligarchs by freeing up some of their assets, etc...

And yes, obviously this needs to be highlighted AND also this should NOT be a shock.Racism existed in Europe before the war started last week and unsurprisingly, war hasn't made that reality any better.

War generally has a tendency to take shitty things and make it even worse. A simple hypothetical, imagine that in an absurd reality America decides to conduct a ""special military operation"" in Canada. What do we know about Canada? Well we're pretty racist up here to, and as a Canadian I would bet money that we would be pulling pretty much the same shit (I mean we aren't even in a war and we treat out Indigenous population like crap.) Does it make it okay? No. Does that mean that America would be right about their operation? Also no.

War sucks for many reasons, this being one of them, we see the worst side of humanity. The war wasn't going to make racism just ""go away"". You would be naïve and frankly an idiot to believe that. People get even more tribal and it gets very ugly. We also need to be thinking critically about why now we are being told about the racism in Ukraine now. Maybe because it kinda makes it easier to not care about the war or maybe now it feels justified.

Racism is AWFUL, and there is also a difference between being racist and being a Nazi. Russian propaganda is trying to do equate the two and this is playing right into that narrative.

Germany took in less than half of the refugees Turkey took in. [And Turkey sheltered refugees for far longer](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2021/06/22/10-years-on-turkey-continues-its-support-for-an-ever-growing-number-of-syrian-refugees), without having a cultural and/or political meltdown over it. And they are not exactly a rich country. This proves my point.

Greece was left to bear the rest of the burden. But the civilized and enlightened Europeans had multiple meltdowns over sheltering [as few as 904 people](https://www.handelsblatt.com/english/politics/resettlement-plan-eu-refugee-quotas-failing-despite-landmark-ruling/23572112.html?ticket=ST-5398980-VtW7np10rXDLX5rl7h4v-ap6). Europeans [refused to help Greece relocate even 5%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/08/eu-met-only-5-of-target-for-relocating-refugees-from-greece-and-italy). Despite Greece suffering a massive economic crisis, they were told to go fuck themselves and just deal with it.

The EU seemed ready to collapse, the idea of refugees caused [cultural panics in the UK](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f510b25581c993fae11fe42817a9c6d3780f376/0_305_5049_3029/master/5049.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95fad1226ec034297f9682fc8fd82590) and the stability of the Union was questioned.

Merkel's choice to take in refugees [was very unpopular](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-merkel-popularity-idUSKCN0RV4VZ20151001). Germans lost their minds, [burning down refugees shelters](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-222-refugee-homes-burned-or-attacked-arrests-a6763506.html) like nobody's business. The far-right surged across Europe. Even the blue eyed, blonde haired civilized friends of ours [shifted right](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29202793). See, they just had to deal with a fraction of what Greece dealt with, [and absolutely hated it](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/17/even-sweden-doesnt-want-migrants-anymore-syria-iraq-belarus/).

The point, is that accepting MAD as a reasoning as to why nuclear war won’t happens assumes that nuclear capable countries would only use the nukes to defend themselves from an invasion or to counter an incoming nuclear attack. When a country moves beyond that and threatens to use their nukes first, so that they are unopposed in their invasions of peaceful countries, then you can’t hide behind MAD anymore.

No. NATO is just a piece of paper. There is no difference to an American between defending Ukraine from Russias imperialistic expansion, and then dying in a nuclear holocaust and defending Norway from Russias imperialistic expansion and then dying in a nuclear holocaust. 

The very concept of MAD assumes a reasonable opposition who won’t initiate nuclear warfare but holds the option to respond to nuclear warfare with their own nukes. When the opposition isn’t reasonable and threatens to nuke everyone if they don’t get what they want, then MAD has to be thrown out. At the very least, the west can’t sit by and wait for someone else to become the victim of Putin. Russias threats show they have no qualms about being the aggressor. About initiating nuclear holocaust. Even if the rest of the world doesn’t assist Ukraine, they cannot sit by without doing something to disarm Russia.

Putin will not stop and the only way this stops is for the Russian people themselves to stop him. If they don't, we're in.

That's what I'm saying, this is not true. It's actually the opposite. Unchecked aggression and violence gets you thrown out of society. There's plenty of credible research on this particular subject, but tbh one needn't look any further than common sense. If Man X murdered Man Y in the middle of the street, does that somehow increase his chances of mating/professional success? No, in fact it's the opposite. He probably gets fired and goes to jail.

You're conflating physical aggression (violence) with ""proactive behaviour"", which is sometimes colloquially referred to as ""aggression"". But in the context of real military conflict, that particular interpretation is irrelevant. 

We are strictly talking about physical aggression, which is definitely not a beneficial trait for survival in a society.

People like this Dugin and Spencer are why I (a Jew) loathe Jewish conservatives so much. People like Ben Shapiro think that we've become just another group of white people now, and proudly support men like Trump. Meanwhile, LITERAL NAZIS are saying to ""party like it's 1933"" when Trump got elected. Like, how willfully blind do you have to be, to denounce BLM, and join the side of the people in Charlottesville chanting ""Jews will not replace us."" This guy Spencer has in no uncertain terms declared his love for Hitler and Trump, how does that not give at least some pause to a Jew. How does someone related to Holocaust suvivors not see black people being killed by the state's police, and Mexican children being put in cages, and not see a resemblemce.

And now, we have a tyrant literally waging a war to assassinate a Jewish head of state, and the US right wing is on the tyrant's side. Meanwhile, worms like Shapiro and his ilk sheepishly say they support Ukraine, while still aligning themselves with a party that has a sizable portion of its members rooting for its destruction. The ties between the US right and Russia are so obvious, and yet some Jews will rationalize it away. I know studies have said 70% of American Jews are liberals, but that other 30% is still way too high a number.

It's so selfish, like if one day the alt-right comes into power, when they start ethnic cleansing, Shapiro will say to the men with Swastikas on their arms ""well gee guys, I'm white just like you! Remember, I'm on your side."" Jews in this country have benefited greatly from the color of our skin, but many have gotten complacent, and forgotten the deep contempt that's still out there for us. They're basically the Jewish equivalent of Uncle Tom (Uncle Shlomo, I like to say). And Isreal, which is supposed to be a haven for us, and a global protector, is out here committing war crimes of their own. It's like they've forgotten who they are and why they exist.
