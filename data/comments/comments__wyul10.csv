Day 185 of my updates from Kharkiv.

There was some shelling today, but not much, I think it only happened once at 5pm, and they only fired a couple of MLRS rockets, but we don’t know where they landed. There was also a missile strike, and not just one, but two of them, second one coming 2 hours after the first one.

The first missile strike happened at 12am, there were 2 missiles, and both of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast. Then at 2am a second missile happened, but it was “special”, because they fired 2 missiles again, but both of them malfunctioned and fell in Belgorod oblast, somewhere between Yasnye Zori and Nikolskoye.

It’s always nice seeing Russia bomb itself, and Russians are not against bombing Ukraine, they are just unhappy that their missiles are shit, which is why they bomb themselves half the time. One of the missiles from yesterday damaged yet another school in Kharkiv, so it’s doubly better seeing their missiles hitting their own territory, and actually doing some proper denazification.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 27 August 2022

- Over the last five days, there has probably been an increase in the intensity of Russian assaults along the Donetsk sector of the Donbas. North of Donetsk city, there has been intense fighting near the towns of Siversk and Bakhmut. Pro-Russian separatist militia have probably made some progress towards the centre of the village of Pisky, near Donetsk Airport. However, overall, Russian forces have secured few territorial gains.

- There is a realistic possibility that Russia has increased its efforts in the Donbas in an attempt to draw in or fix additional Ukrainian units, amid speculation that Ukraine is planning a major counter-offensive.",False,1661583713.0,t3_wyul10,t3_wyul10,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

NYT Front Page: U.S. Feared Trump Files Put Spies At Risk

Interesting narrative emerging from the timeline learned in the Trump / FBI raid affidavit... 

It would appear that Trump took files including information on human intelligence sources and stored them, illegally, in this home in Florida.  

This happened in January 2021... 

In October 2021, it was reported that there was a substantial increase in our informants and spies getting captured and killed, leading to the CIA issuing a warning to every CIA station and base around the world sounding the alarm about this troubling development.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/us/politics/cia-informants-killed-captured.html

We can also remember that in 2017  the US had to exfiltrate a top Russian spy due,  in part, to concerns that Trump was mishandling classified information.  

https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/politics/russia-us-spy-extracted/index.html

It would appear that Trump may have directly, and substantially harmed the US's intelligence gathering capability immediately preceding the invasion in Ukraine... I can only imagine how many Ukrainian lives could have been saved if the US was operating at full capacity in Russia... 

Please remember this when voting in November if you're an American and support Ukraine.",1661610856.0,1661610552.0,t3_wyul10,t3_wyul10,,0,164,0,164,2,0,

Cancelling all sanctions, halting all support for Ukraine, allowing Russia to murder, rape and torture their way across the entire country so that Ukrainian identity is wiped away and Putin achieves a complete strategic victory while the West is humiliated in defeat?  All so that, maybe (if Putin feels like it), we can have slightly cheaper energy bills?

And then what?  Having established that cheap gas is more important to Europe than human lives, or land, or principles of democracy and self determination, why *wouldn't* Putin move beyond Ukraine's borders deeper into, say, Moldova?  Or create provocations and escalations with ""little green men"" in Russian-leaning regions of the Baltics?  What would be our response then?  There's a very good reason why one should never give in to blackmail: the blackmailer will only come back and demand more.

And there are some things that are worth a little sacrifice.  Slightly higher energy bills are, in the grand scheme of things, a pretty small sacrifice.  It's not like our homes are being bombed, our children are being raped, our fathers are being tortured.  We weathered all the economic ""devastation"" of COVID without too much complaint, why on earth should some slightly higher energy bills be so much worse?

Because when you think about it, NATO might be the best deterrent there is, but with the level of propaganda in Russia, if they properly prepare it, they could prepare and order an attack on Latvia or Estonia, but even a swift and brutal NATO counterattack will not bring back the inevitable dead soldiers and civilians that could have easily been avoided. I think wearing an extra sweater ans blankets, also government help for those affected by the energy crisis are far easier to manage than this reality.

Why Finland fear Putin?  No need for any of that.  Hawks are crazy silly.  Russia would not send tanks into Hungary. Russia would not send tanks into Czechoslovakia.  Russia would not invade Afghanistan.  Hahaha - all that was not Russia.  Russia would not have special military operation in Georgia.  Russia would not have special military operation in Chechnya.  Everyone in world know Crimea belonged to Russia anyway, so that doesn’t count.  Russia is benevolent country merely seeking to spread peace to lesser countries of the world by strong leadership with a firm hand.

Moldavia and Czech should have no concern.  The people in Germany and France know re-alignment into benevolent Russian hegemony will stop before it gets to their borders.  Denmark could provide good sea-ports for Russia, but of course Russia has no desire there.  England is far away, and the English Channel stopped the Axis powers in the last great patriotic war.  So no worry.  Plus Russian language is easy to learn anyway.

So you see that proper thinking shows war in Europe, oops, *western* Europe is just silly.  Crazy talk never to happen.  No need to look east - nothing to see… no war, no targeting of civilians, no attacking train stations, no blowing up of apartments, nobody shot in the back, no shopping malls blown up, no children being kidnapped and stolen, nothing but little small special operation.  Could never affect you in any way at all.

You can throw in a dose of whitewashed Soviet nostalgia as well.

It's likely that if a new individual or group ousts Putin, they will lay ALL of the blame at Putin's feet. Key to all of this will be the press, and they would be essential during a transition. Things could become chaotic if there are competing interests, so I would guess that the State would continue to exercise a degree of control over the press.

For the Germans and Japanese at the end of World War II, losing the war pretty much did the trick.

The problem is, people who are brainwashed tend to double down until they cannot double down any longer. People do not want to accept that they have been played for suckers.  (This is why Trump's lickspittle legions are so willing to ignore the mountain of evidence of blatant criminality in the White House.)  In the end, Germany and Japan had no more cards to pull out of their sleeves. Berlin was under Allied control. Nagasaki and Hiroshima had been reduced to rubble. The public had no choice but to accept reality. You can't double down when you're out of chips.

Cultures vary, and groups of people can have common, defining attributes and qualities about them. But in the modern Russian state, as in the Soviets state that preceded it, the flow of information to the people is constantly manipulated in a truly exceptional way. Now this in itself is not really enough to warrant the label of brainwashing, but state control of information is certainly getting there. What they are doing is psychologically one step beyond, though: they not just control the stated truths, but also by design manipulate the *idea* of truth. By presenting simultaneous and contradictory versions of the truth the state leaves the populace puzzled as to which truth is in fact real. This undermines confidence in the *very idea* of a consensus. We aren't talking about differing points of view, we are talking about purposely lying in a way as to make it very clear you are lying, but unclear as to where the facts stop and the lying starts. Consequently they lie not just about bad things they have done but also good. 

The brainwashing is this attack on the foundations of truth itself. It's very effective at controlling a population (in the small picture) because people need to get on with their lives, and, untrusting and unable to differentiate the lies in the big picture the only move remaining is to become apolitical and accept whatever is fed to them.

That's the plan at least. And it very much is a concerted effort. A very, very cynical manipulation of reality to influence less on what people think but rather how they think. And that is brainwashing. 

The Russian state is somewhat unique in their application of this very cynical strategy. Other states attempt to guide their populations using propoganda. The Chinese come to mind, but in my eyes they are taking a very different approach, wanting the people to choose for themselves to be model right-thinking citizens with rewards and the stick when necessary. That's authoritarian but lacks the cynical brainwashing of producing the conclusion that if nothing is true than anything can be true, and so just give up and trust the state.",False,1661613085.0,t3_wyul10,t1_im00dhi,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Sure, you can probably launch it, but without some heavy modifications to the plane, including adding potential targeting pods, it won't be able to full utilize the weapons the same way.

They are one of the great powers, formerly one of the two superpowers, that got to decide what the post WWII would look like. And they have nukes. 

The security council is meant to not be able to act against its own members. None of them would have joined if it could. The security council provides a mechanism for the great powers to act against a state that they all agree is a problem without anyone feeling like they are stepping on each others toes. 

>there's no point of having a trial.

The UN isn't a court. Russia isn't on trial. International relations are nothing like the relationships between individuals and states. Your analogy presupposes there is a higher authority, the state, that can enforce its will. That can force people to abide by the court's decisions. There is no such higher authority between states.

So if somehow you make it through 90 miles of man pads or potential interception, you have 90 miles more to go of open sea. You're a textbook case of an easy target. 

Being low also means you have far less potential energy to spend in trying to get away from a missile. You can't use your altitude to dive since well, you're already on the ground.

The Ukrainian infantry largely stopped the Russian invasion using handheld weapons like javelins- remember trump threatening to hold these back unless zelensky launched an investigation into hunter Biden?
Now that Ukraine has shown it’s not going to get KTFO - they getting these new weapons systems which they are now training on.
