Russian column near Kyiv hampered by breakdowns

Frank Gardner
BBC Security Correspondent

Some clarity on that massive Russian armoured column heading south towards Kyiv.

Close analysis of the latest satellite images by McKenzie Intelligence Services reveals the following:

The convoy is not 40 miles long, it’s a series of logistical ‘packets’ strung out along a major highway from the Belarus border, aiming to link up with Russian units on the northern outskirts of Kyiv.

The convoy appears to be hampered in several places by broken down vehicles.

The column consists of some armour (tanks) and infantry fighting vehicles but mainly logistical vehicles, implying plans for more than just a brief battle.

Separately, the imagery examined by McKenzie Intelligence Services shows a Russian parachute battalion dug in to the area of Hostomel airfield - Ukraine's most important international cargo airport and a key military airbase near Kyiv.

But their artillery is assessed to be outside the range of most of the capital.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say their morale problems are even worse. Allow me to explain, since I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere yet. 

Not only does the Russian army, like the Soviet army, rely heavily on conscription, it has an \*enormous\* problem with ritualized hazing and bullying, a practice called ""dedovshchina,"" which is a sort of untranslatable phrase that means something like ""the rule of the seniors."" Essentially, new conscripts are bullied, tortured, and sometimes murdered and sexually assaulted by older conscripts, closer to finishing up their terms. Once the ""uncles"" are gone, the bullied become the bullies and the cycle begins anew. Ah, springtime!

This has been a massive problem since at least the Soviet period, and despite some reforms (including reducing the length of the conscription period, which means that conscripts are going into battle now with even less experience and training than before) the Russian army and government has shown little interest in actually stopping this problem. 

What this means is, not only does it seem like the Russian army is running out of gas and food, many of the Russian troops are teenagers who hate each other and have been coerced into bullying each other mercilessly. Lots of young Russian men try desperately to avoid military service because of dedovshchina. I remember having drinks with a guy at Moscow State University once who explained the various ruses his relatively well-off parents were using to keep him out of the army. His girlfriend was annoyed that he never wanted to go on mall dates with her because there were rumors that army ""recruiters"" were snatching young men of military age and forcing them to ""enlist.""

Source: I have a PhD in Russian lit/studies, hire me plz; also, google dedovshchina if you want to know more.

In 2013, the average Russian salary was 30,000 Rubles.  The Ruble was worth $0.03 USD, so the effective average USD salary was **$900.**  
Since the 2014 invasion of Crimea and recent events, the Ruble is now worth $0.0085 USD.  The average Russian salary in Ruble has also grown to 51,000/mo.  This is **$433.5/mo**  
**This means that Russian salary since Putin's ambitions in Ukraine starting in 2014 have more than halved from $900/mo to $433.5/mo!**  
Keep in mind, the Ruble is only being kept where it is because the Russian Central Bank is spending foreign exchange reserves to prop up the price of the Ruble by purchasing it.  This won't last forever, but we don't know how long.

3. Kherson -> Transnistria (Moldova's separatist region). The intent appears to cut Odessa off and limit Ukraine's access to Black Sea.

>They told us some details of yesterday's failed attempt at sending sea troops ""directly to Odessa.""

>Putin's command, indeed, planned such an operation, and large landing ships, you won't believe it, were going to dock to the Luzanovsky beach mined and blocked by anti-tank hedgehogs, having previously worked out in the vicinity of multiple launchers.

>At the same time, enemy helicopters and a large number of UAVs flew into the bay.

>Ukrainian air defense and other defenders were preparing to give a decisive rebuff to the enemy, but at the very last moment the Russians got in touch and asked to give them the opportunity to leave the bay.

>According to our data, there was a real riot on Russian ships: Russian men refused to follow the order and storm the coast of the Slavic Russian-speaking community.

>Russian soldiers, follow the example of your comrades!

This is a from a screenshot of a facebook post.

EDIT: For those asking if this is true, I commented this somewhere else

From what I've seen coming out right now I would not be suprised if it is.

- Russian soldiers obviously were lied to so far, some being told they were just going on a training exercise until they were actually shot at with live ammo.

- Support for this invasion is incredibly low, troops are poorly trained and the propaganda leading up to it so far seems to have failed, it's hard to shut out the entire outside world in the modern age, even for a country like Russia.

- Ukrainians and Russians have a long relationship, they do regard themselves as brothers and sisters in a way.

There are a ton more reasons, such as incredibly poor logistics on the Russian side, general corruption within the army etc. but I myself wouldn't be surprised if people are rapidly getting fed up with Putin within Russia by now, especially within the military.

That's the problem when you actually become a dictator, you're surrounded by puppets, they're too scared to tell you the truth.

Remember this little clip, Putin with his Spy chief right before the invasion, it's telling:

While everyone is focused on Ukraine, I think the world might need to also keep an eye on Kazakhstan

Some background: Kazakhstan just went through a very violent coup (the current leader ordered protestors shot in the streets). During the coup Russia sent CSTO peacekeeping forces to secure uranium mining and processing facilities (one of the country's most important industries). During this time I think Putin calculated that the new leader in Kazakhstan was just another Russian proxy. However, what really happened was that the Russian proxy leader was overthrown by a leader more friendly to China

Recently Russia made a request to Kazakhstan to supply forces to help with it's invasion of Ukraine. Kazakhstan didn't just refuse, they refused, blocked Russian media outlets in their country and openly stated that they don't see the LDR/DPR as separate countries. I cant imagine this made Putin very happy

Over the last few days I've noticed some interesting developments

1: Russia has announced it's relocating troops from the far east of the country to an area on the eastern border of Kazakhstan (and northern border of Georgia).

2: Reports are coming in that Kazakhstan has tested emergency sirens in Alamaty, a city on the western side of the country (same side as Russian troops)

3: Unconfirmed reports are showing large scale military movements within Kazakhstan (on twitter there is a 10KM convoy apparantly)

I'm thinking Putin could be making a move on Kazakhstan to force their compliance. The new government there is probably unstable and the main protests during the coup were in Kazakhstan. Maybe Putin thinks he can march 1000 troops and 100 tanks in and take the country with little resistance? Georgia has been very quiet and is sticking with the 'keep my head down' tactic in hopes that Russia will ignore them. If Russia is going to ignore Georgia for now whats the logic for having troops on the border?

If Putin could take Kazakhstan easily, he could turn around and pitch to Russians back home that he liberated the country from a dictator that violently put down protests. Maybe he could even get them to be convinced that 'the costs are worth the wars''?

On the other hand if Kazakhstan folds and gives him troops/support for Ukraine that would work in his favor too

Edit: Also to add Kazakhstan's currency has tanked 20% in the last week. I imagine it's citizens aren't particularly happy right now",1646152577.0,1646152223.0,t3_t4buw2,t3_t4buw2,,0,80,0,80,0,0,

This includes forbidding Ukrainian national language from being taught in schools and from used in government work, erasing cultural heroes from their history, and attempting to control the territory outright or as a vassal state.

Looking at it from the historical lens, it seems more and more than Putin may not have lost his mind but saw the inevitable writing on the wall: Ukraine was ready and has been working towards becoming a part of the EU and leaving behind Russia once and for all. He decided the time to act was now before Ukraine was lost to Russia for good. Approximately 100 years ago, 5,000 Ukrainians were rounded up and shot for the idea of a free and independent Ukraine. If you are a citizen in Ukraine right now, there is no history more important for your country then the present right now. 

Now, because of this war, Putin is attempting to drag Ukraine back into the fold and doesn't care if by consequence he will cause Ukraine and his own country back 20 years of progress.

Honestly, it really makes me wonder why Putin who purports himself to be such a strong leader is too cowardly to be upfront with his actions. In truth, being short in stature, Putin appears to suffer from classic Napoleon Complex—his psyche still firmly locked into an '80s Cold-War mindset that so thoroughly gripped his reality. Putin may show himself shirtless and being a macho bear, but in reality, his geopolitical projection is closer to that of a snake, both dishonorable and dishonest. 

Appealing to fear and *using* fear as intimidation and leverage is commonplace and well-documented. It's an oligarchy with a mafioso crime boss at its head. This is not a conspiracy, this is evidence that continues to mound.

For The Shock Doctrine, I recommend the thoroughly-cited book, but I linked the full doc Klein's husband made that's a good summary. [Here's the 6 minute trailer](https://youtu.be/EuyRdJupbvU). It doesn't just focus on Russia, but uses them as a case-study for the thesis.

This is a serious problem.

Everyone here needs to take a step back, breath, and let some of the entirely warranted tension they’re feeling dissipate.

If you practice meditation, do so for a few. If you have a dog, play with them. This building sense of fear and fury works against all of us. I want to be clear - no one is “to blame” - this is the first time in history a war has been functionally live streamed 24/7, with demonstrable war crimes being documented.

It is important to call out trolls, both alt right and Russian/state actors, but be careful that you know what you’re looking out for. Here is a video series that really breaks down what they do (warning: it’s a sizable time commitment, but totally worth it): https://youtu.be/4xGawJIseNY

Here are some pointers:

A Russian shill will post according to Russian time zones. Generally speaking, they’ll make a provocative claim that they do not bother backing up. Their intention is to introduce ideas and arguments into the public discourse that stoke fear, raise doubts, and create a sense of general paralysis.

In contrast, an alt right troll will likely be someone doing this for fun or to “own the libs”, and will have a largely cohesive account. They’ll employ explicitly bad faith logical fallacies such as:

The ad hominem, where they attack the person in question when they can’t dismantle their argument: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem

The straw man, where they recast the logic of the other person in question into something easier to dismiss and often not actually related to what they’re saying: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

A red herring, where they attempt to shift discourse away from important points to ones that are not and likely also divisive: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring

At the core, a troll seeks to create a sense of unreality by claiming objective reality can’t really be known, stoke division with bad faith arguments and identity politics, and to make refuting them exhausting for both the observer and individual countering them. They do *not* argue in good faith, and will consistently try to push the burden of proof onto the other person when *they* make outrageous claims.

Do not accuse someone of being a troll just for expressing an opinion if they are presenting a logical argument or overwhelmed by emotion. These people will *engage* if you try with them. Those that don’t are the ones you need to be concerned about.

Breath deep. We can *choose* to be a community that works together and supports Ukraine and each other. It is, quite literally, under attack, and will require effort and awareness on all of our parts to maintain and support. We are all emotional because we care.

**Spreading fear** (bringing up nukes constantly, claims of WW3 escalation, constantly bringing up convoys, etc; of course not all instances of this are trolls, some are just scared and nervous people.)

**Misdirection** (moving goalposts, whataboutisms, concern trolling (usually along the lines of **X is terrible, but Y...** where X is something any sensible person can agree with, while Y is what they're trying to steer you towards))

**Sowing doubt** (e.g. excessive pessimism, shooting down things like ""That's never going to happen"", fatalism such as projecting that Ukraine's defeat is certain in the end, etc.)

**Sowing division** (e.g. all the vitriol directed at Germany whenever they lag behind even a little, such as unduly focusing on them only sending non-weaponry at first and all of the demonization of Switzerland for being neutral ... these are valid things to be upset over, but my signal-boosting them they foster toxicity and hope for us to turn us against each other; the sensible approach is to instead recommend people in said countries to contact their representatives and voice their concerns in a civil manner. Another example is things like inflaming divides, e.g. left VS right (Trump, Fox, radical leftists, etc), poor VS rich, white VS PoC (e.g. all the pushing of ""Ukraine is full of Nazis"" and ""Ukrainians are beating and ignoring Indians and black people at the train stations"", etc; there are instances of both, but they try to push it as if it's the norm and not rare occurrences)).

**Misinformation** (especially conspiracy theories; just look at /r/conspiracy if you doubt me ... and another case in point: QAnon. Another aspect of this is making claims without providing reliable sources and exaggerating things.)

The common thread is that they try to find a weakness (a fear, an insecurity, a doubt, an actual event, etc) and then they exaggerate it. Like pouring gasoline on a small flame or hitting a crack with a sledge hammer. This kind of propaganda is far more effective than just completely fabricating something (even though this happens as well). Kind of like the saying **""The best lies have a grain of truth.""**

-----

# How to combat it:

**Downvote posts that are suspicious.** 

Check their post-history to see how much of the above they're engaged in. (Other suspicious tells are: claiming to be X while making claims that seem to run counter to that, young accounts, account inactivity until recently, Word_Word_NNNN names (with the Ns being numbers and the underscores being optional or sometimes hyphens).

**Be sceptical.** (But not paranoid.)

Ask for sources when claims are made. And ask yourself whether the post benefits the victims or the aggressors of the conflict.

**Reassure the worried.**

Ask excessively negative people to take a break and relax, etc.

(Even if a nuclear holocaust is a possibility, it's highly unlikely, and worrying about it won't do us any good.)

**De-escalate.**

Ask people that are pointing fingers at non-Russians in a negative way to focus on the bigger fish instead (more productive; the world needs unity in times like these; the appropriate discussions for other topics are better reserved for a different forum or a different time, IMO. In moderation it's not a problem, but when a thread gets flooded with such a topic it's definitely suspicious.)

When encountering attempts at misdirections, tell them that here and now isn't the time and place for it.

**Downvote toxic trolls, meme spam, etc.**

**Upvote constructive, positive posts.**

-----

Of course, the first section will have false positives and the second section isn't an ideal solution for all cases, but I think that these are some good general guidelines for a situation such as this.

And if anyone have suggestions to add, let me know and I'll update the lists.

Also, I'd recommend using some extension like Reddit Enhancement Suit that has a feature that keeps tracks of your downvotes and upvotes at a per user level (for me they show up as e.g. a [+12] in green or [-9] in red next to their username ; that way the more you upvote and downvote good and bad posts, the easier it will be able to identify posters as allies or potential bad actors.

-----

**edit 1**: 

Jumping to conclusions is of course bad. Please try to check post-histories before assuming someone is a bad actor.

The stories of Russian defeat are screamed from the rooftops and the stories of Ukrainian defeat are quickly suppressed. In a conflict like this, let me tell you, BOTH sides will win and lose in different areas. Take every story with a grain of salt.

I only say this because I see a lot of people soaking up all the news they see and assume Russia is on the brink of losing the war. Of course we will think that, because any story of things going well for Russian troops (supplies arriving, troops winning battles, Ukrainians surrendering) are quickly shot down for various reasons.

Yes, Russia still has more soldiers, more tanks. But this isn't a problem that can be solved by throwing more soldiers and tanks at the problem. Russia's getting its ass kicked because of poor organization, logistics and troop preparedness. They're running out of food and fuel, they lack the means to coordinate larger offensives, and morale is so low that many Russian soldiers are choosing to surrender without a fight.

Throwing more manpower into that won't fix the problem, because the problem *isn't* a lack of manpower in the first place. Russia has all the manpower it needs to defeat Ukraine... it's just being used incredibly poorly. 

If they really want to turn this around, what they need to do is pull back and reorganize everything. Get their frontline units enough fuel to move their vehicles forward. Open up proper lines of communication up the chain of command. Improve discipline at every level. Then, and only then, will they have the strength to take Kyiv. 

There were signs yesterday that Russia's attempting to do some of that, but Ukraine is making that difficult for them. Ukraine is blowing up fuel trucks, spying on communications and doing everything they can to encourage Russian surrenders. And that's keeping them off-balance, keeping them slow and vulnerable. 

Every day they fail to rectify those logistics issues, Ukraine's long-term chances here keep getting higher and higher. Russia still has the capacity to win right now, but that won't be the case if they aren't able to change the situation soon.

- Giuliani recently gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics.  Meanwhile:

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius.""

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack domestic opposition's data.

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow and met with their government officials.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands) 

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

I still think the answer to this conflict is isolating Russia economically. I am no military expert but I just don't see how anybody really stops Russia from eventually invading and occupying these Ukrainian cities. Any major superpower in the world can brute-force occupy another smaller country if they're willing to take the losses to do it. The question is  - at what price? If all Putin wants is to extend Russian borders then he can technically claim victory. But if wants a unified, peaceful, prosperous and happy annexed Ukraine/Russian relationship is that even possible?  We have learned that America sucked at exporting democracy through our military adventures in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq and I assume the same is true for exporting authoritarianism.  Once Putin installs and new government, executes or jails his opponents and secures all of the Ukraine's major logistical apparatus Russia's borders will be extended geographically but he will have shrunk his country and his legacy in every other way:  economically, socially and from an international public relations perspective.

But looking forward it seemed that Ukraine would just be a stepping stone. Soon it would be, oh Poland is nazi'ing it all up in there and on and on.  


The problem is they have nukes so you don't want to cause Armageddon over one country but like I just said this won't end. Putin will continue to play that card until he attacks everything he wants. 

I think the various leaders realized this. Today or tomorrow we have to face this. We have to take that chance and make a stand.

One road with tens of miles of traffic between the fuel, maintenance, and ammunition support and the tracks that need it.

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city and a major target of Russia’s invading forces, has a special place in the Kremlin’s version of history, which portrays it as the place that demonstrates the folly of Ukraine trying to live apart from Russia.

Russian troops poured across the border just 20 miles from the city early Thursday with residents reporting loud explosions, apparently caused by artillery shells or missiles landing on the outskirts of town.

Closer to Russia than any other large Ukrainian city, Kharkiv has long loomed large in President Vladimir V. Putin’s view that Ukraine is no more than an appendage of Russia unjustly snatched away by the machinations of foreigners and misguided Ukrainian nationalists.

When protesters in Kyiv toppled Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in 2014, Kharkiv became the focus of a Russian-orchestrated effort to rally opposition to the new government in Kyiv and restore Mr. Yanukovych to power. The ousted president fled to Kharkiv, where the mayor at the time, Hennadiy Kernes, hosted a congress of pro-Russia politicians and officials from largely Russian-speaking regions in the east and southeast of Ukraine.

That effort, supported by Russian agents and agitators from across the nearby border, quickly fizzled but generated many of the propaganda tropes now being deployed by the Kremlin: claims that Ukraine has been taken over by neo-Nazis; that Ukraine’s Russian speakers are in mortal danger; that Ukraine exists as a country only as result of foreign meddling.

Kharkiv, long a melting pot of different ethnic groups, including a large Jewish population, played a particularly important role in shaping Ukraine during and after World War I. It served as the first capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a largely Moscow-controlled entity set up in opposition to the Ukrainian People’s Republic in Kyiv, which sought to break away from Moscow and declared an independent Ukrainian state.

Soviet forces based in Kharkiv quickly crushed this early attempt at Ukrainian statehood, seizing Kyiv in February 1918.

In a lengthy historical essay on Ukraine published last July, Mr. Putin cited this obscure episode as an example of the doomed, foolhardy attempts to establish a Ukrainian state by “the different quasi-state formations that emerged across the former Russian empire.”

This history, Mr. Putin added, carried a pointed message for the current leaders of Ukraine: “For those who have today given up the full control of Ukraine to external forces, it would be instructive to remember that, back in 1918, such a decision proved fatal for the ruling regime in Kiev.”

NATO is not coming in as the cavalry. Ukraine has to be okay with giving away Crimea or Donbas or they'll be turned into a vassal state at best and utterly destroyed at worst. If it gets bad enough, we ALL might get utterly destroyed. Saving Ukraine's sovereignty and 40 million lives isn't worth 100+ million deaths in 24 hours in a nuclear war.

He has a deescalation pathway. First off, there's always more he can lose economically. If he leaves, no new sanctions. Second, many existing sanctions get drawn back in proportion to how far he's willing to withdraw his forces out of Ukraine entirely.

He can stop any time. His de-escalation pathway will be the future penalties he won't have to face. There's *always* more to lose, no matter how much he wants to convince us that he doesn't see it that way. It's vital to remember that Putin is *bluffing* in much of what he says.

The key, however, is not to give him any consolation prizes, like letting him keep Crimea or Donbas. He's counting on that. It's probably his end game, to be honest.

The Budapest Memorandum was negotiated at political level, but it is not entirely clear whether the instrument is devoid entirely of legal provisions. It refers to assurances, but it does not impose a legal obligation of military assistance on its parties.[1][26] According to Stephen MacFarlane, a professor of international relations, ""It gives signatories justification if they take action, but it does not force anyone to act in Ukraine.""[25] In the US, neither the George H. W. Bush administration nor the Clinton administration was prepared to give a military commitment to Ukraine, and they did not believe the US Senate would ratify an international treaty and so the memorandum was adopted in more limited terms.[26] The memorandum has a requirement of consultation among the parties ""in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning the... commitments"" set out in the memorandum.[27] Whether or not the memorandum sets out legal obligations, the difficulties that Ukraine has encountered since early 2014 may cast doubt on the credibility of future security guarantees that are offered in exchange for nonproliferation commitments.[28] Regardless, the United States publicly maintains that ""the Memorandum is not legally binding"", calling it a ""political commitment"".[29]",False,1646157301.0,t3_t4buw2,t1_hyxrywj,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

You are referring to the ""first strike"" principal which has been negated by ""Mutually Assured Destruction"" MAD.

Your commenting form a position of little knowledge on the subject matter.

1. Your point has been pondered and negated ever since the 1950s when both sides decided to produce SSBN, ICBM carrying submarines to counter a ""first strike"" scenario. They are usually hidden and very difficult to detect since 3/4 of the world is water. And both sides have multiple SSBN with several dozen ICBMS total and hundreds of warheads total.
2. Russia counters America by having rail and road mobile ICBMs that are constantly moving in the world's largest country. We gave up on rail and road mobile ICBMs.
3. Military leaders aren't stupid both sides have early warning satellites to detect ICBM launches in the boost phase. Though we have the biggest and best network.
4. Though unverified Russia claims to have a ""dead hand"" fail safe, that once nuclear readiness is set to high, the system is set up that isolated officers in silos deep underground will receive launch orders if communication is lost to the Kremlin. Supposedly the officer will then verify the accuracy and not just automatically launch.
5. Nobody really has a fully capable robust ABM (Anti ballistic missile system), the easiest option is to nuke the nuke, but we learn from Operation Starfish high altitude nuke testing that you'd just EMP yourself. So all ABM is hard kill, and hitting a a dart traveling several KM per second with another dart traveling several KM per second is dam hard. Our real ABM system was supposed to be GMD (Ground based Mid course Defense) and GMD didn't do well after many years and tens of billions wasted. We have THAAD and SM-3 but their limited in what phase of flight they can engage ICBMs at. Also Russians have publicized some details about their decoy system on their ICBMs to render ABM a moot point.

Even 'reliable' sources seem to disagree on how many nukes Russia has. I've seen from the high hundreds to 6,000 reported during this past week. 

Russia is showing a complete lack of competence and preparedness with their military. Does this extend to their nukes? 

What are our stopping capabilities?  1 Missile? 100? 1,000?

Russia has had a single man stop a nuclear holocaust once. Who is in charge? Are they willing to obey the order, can they stop the missiles from being fired? Basically, what is the political climate in the group of men executing Putin's orders? 

The US has accidentally dropped Nuclear bombs on it's own soil and it's speculated that by complete luck there wasn't an explosion. 

MAAD is a theory, but what is the reality. Are nukes just negotiating tools, or are they actually tools of destruction? It makes more sense in modern times for them to be used for negotiation. There is no way you can win a nuclear war. Russia has been exposed technologically, tactically and economically. If they fire a nuke, it is unknown if it would hit it's target or even detonate. They are struggling to hit targets they are near in Ukraine when time is against them, every day spent not having captured Kiev is a huge blow to Russia. They literally can't afford to miss, but they are. So, are they missing on purpose, or are they incompetent?

But much like your comparison - if someone's fear of spiders is so overwhelming that it causes them to hyperventilate, fear for their lives, and unable to use any semblence of emotional deescalation - then the answer is not to continue staring at the spider and sob about how the world is ending. It's to leave the room, stop looking at it, deescalate emotionally, and seek support from loved ones. 

Whether we like it or not, humans are social animals. If a human panics, our instincts tell us to also panic. We remove all rationality and rely on adrenaline and emotion to get us out of danger. This is exactly why Russia is threatening nuclear bombs. They're hoping the leaders of the world seize with enough panic at the idea that they won't fight - they'll freeze and do nothing, and let them take Ukraine. But if you think about it for long enough - if they DID use nuclear power, what would be left to rule over?

Sitting at your computer or phone doomscrolling about how you're terrified of the world ending will not help you. This is exactly why the bots are doing it. They're aiming to sow dissent and fear so that the people of the world ALSO get scared - ""Oh my god, but what if Russia bombs us? We're so scared, please, please stop pissing them off! Leave them alone! WE'RE SO SCARED OF BEING BOMBED PLEASE WE DON'T WANT TO DIE!"" 

That's exactly what Russia wants. They want you to feel enough terror to stir everyone else into panic. 

But that's not progressive or helpful. Not to you, and certainly not to everyone else.

Putin made it clear in December. They want another 1.000 km of safe space against NATO. If in the event of a conflict between NATO and Russia the allied ground troops have to pass 1.400 km of space to reach Moscow, that's powerful. They basically want to be like the US, surrounded by coasts they own and friendly countries. Owning the entire Northern Black Sea coast means NATO troops can only get to Russia through a massive sea assault comparable to D day or through Georgia. If they were to attack through the Baltics NATO would be subject to Russian subs and it would take months to build up an army. And they would have a very small point of entry into Russia.

As for NATO expansion eastwards I agree a lot more, but at the same time we need to consider that these countries wanted protection from being attacked by Russia. There are obvious historical reasons for that. Like Russia doesn't trust the West, the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary etc don't trust Russia. NATO membership for them was and is the only way for them to know they're safe from invasion from their east. Not letting them join would be like telling Russia ""yeah they're yours"".

No, but they are EU, which does have a mutual defense pact of its own.

> If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.

> Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.

That doesn't mean armed conflict.  Countries that are obligated by the mutual defense clause won't necessarily send troops to Ukraine or Russia, given the implications of doing so.  But it could lead to additional sanctions, or possibly even military measures.  Slovenia, for example, might send an additional ""peacekeeping"" force to their holdings in Ukraine; and it isn't unreasonable that they would want to make it into a multi-national peacekeeping force.",False,1646157961.0,t3_t4buw2,t1_hyxrod5,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

- Russia has plenty of unguided ordinance they can use. But the political cost of using these munitions will be grave because it will make Ukrainian citizens that much angrier when they are occupied and it will blow back on them in the international community (which we are already seeing happen).

- Russia is fearful that sending too many planes into Ukraine at once will get too many of them shot down, after bad experiences in Georgia.

- Russia doesn't have high quality enough intel to know where to bomb in the first place.

- Russia's ground to air communications network is poor. Troops on the ground cannot coordinate air strikes where they are needed in time.

2. Between the initial attack, the war in Syria, and general poverty, the planes that do have pilots likely have very little smart bombs left. Russia likely doesn't want to indiscriminately bomb people because of the political fallout so they're saving their smart bombs they have for important missions. 

3. Even the best militaries sometimes hit their own planes with anti air. Ukraine operates the same planes as Russia AND their AA crews aren't likely well trained. Russia is afraid of shooting for their own planes.

Those were cited. Combined together, likely means Russia is saving what is left of their smart bombs and trained pilots for something worthwhile rather than continue flailing around.",False,1646155623.0,t3_t4buw2,t1_hyxmc3m,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

74fcbfc1bb7fec91d99a8ca21a553f70,t4buw2,hyxoyho,"Big takeaways for me are:

1. The reason Russian convoys seem to be so vulnerable to drones and even air strikes is that they are not integrating well with the air defense troops, and often moving beyond the reach of AA and SAM umbrellas.
2. The lack of precision guided munitions and advanced targeting systems is severely hindering the RuAF capability to conduct close air support missions.
3. Unguided weapons are an option but so far RuAF commanders have been reluctant to use them in urban areas, unlike during their intervention in Syria. This is likely to change soon.
4. It's likely that the RuAF is also reluctant to deploy large amounts of aircraft for fear of friendly fire. This goes back to the poor integration of ground and AA units, which likely also extends to Air Force and AA units.
5. RuAF pilots have very, very few flying hours compared to Western trained militaries, and are unlikely to be qualified enough to use their aircraft effectively. Keeping them back allows the RuAF to somewhat save face and avoid exposing this weakness.

My gut feeling is that on top of this, logistics and maintenance are also terrible, and if your army can't keep a truck functional it sure as shit can't keep complex jets in the air.

edit: and as an addendum, integrating AA/SAM/Ground radars and air force is literally the doctrine around which the Soviet and Russian air forces have been built around for decades.

6829745194915016b57e14af2e37b820,t4buw2,hyxivv1,"That's a very narrow-minded mindset:

First of all, nukes are virtually guaranteed to not be fired, so worrying about that just plays into Russia's hand of fear-mongering. Besides, defeating all invaders isn't the only way to win a war. Ukraine have a very good chance at winning the war through attrition. 

Secondly, for reference, the siege of Aleppo took over 4 years and that was a smaller city with relatively little support (whereas Ukraine has much more modern infrastructure and equipment as well as the majority of the world behind them constantly sending supplies, weapons, etc). **Even if Kyiv falls and Russia starts occupying bigger cities, they'll be facing indefinite insurgencies.**

Thirdly, Russia's war effort currently lacks the manpower needed to hold the cities they take. (One of the reasons they've been avoiding many bigger cities).

Fourthly, Russia doesn't have the logistics and resources (food, gas, high end weaponry, etc) to engage in a long-term conflict with Ukraine. They'll run out of steam and/or starve sooner or later.

Fifthly, they're already facing a ton of desertion and internal protests. And since Ukraine has a lot of Russians (and friends of family of Russians), this front is even more volatile than most wars. Bombing Kharkiv which has a high Russian population definitely isn't going over well. And the ignorance on the home-front is decreasing with every new day.

Sixthly, this is a new age of warfare that calls for different means of combat. Russia is battling as if it's the 80's. The internet, social media, a globalized economy, etc all completely change the landscape of warfare. **And Putin is getting completely fucked on those fronts.**

And lastly, their economy is tanking ***hard*** and if there's one thing Putin is absolutely terrified of, it's economical instability:

> **""After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as ""manual management"" as the Russians like to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of August 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial stability.""**

— Anders Åslund, ""The Illusions of Putin's Russia""

The term is used both for detonation of ammunition not loaded into a weapon, and unintended firing of a loaded weapon due to heating. A fast cook-off is a cook-off caused by fire. A slow cook-off is caused by a sustained thermal event less intense than fire.

 >GLONASS (Russian: ГЛОНАСС, IPA: [ɡɫɐˈnas]; Глобальная навигационная спутниковая система, Global Navigation Satellite System) is a Russian space-based satellite navigation system operating as part of a radionavigation-satellite service. It provides an alternative to GPS and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision. Manufacturers of satellite navigation devices say that adding GLONASS made more satellites available to them, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where buildings may obscure the view to some GPS satellites.

With enough deaths and constant motivation from their leaders, the troops can be swayed to blame Ukraine for all the suffering. They will be promised a quick end to the war if they just push and take Kyiv.  

And what will the Russian troops do? What's the easiest option? To believe in the lie. They saw themselves a Ukrainian missile blow up their friends the other day. It's easy to switch from a philosophical and futile anger at Putin to a more tangible hatred of the enemy who is right in front of them.  

What you're talking about would only happen if enough time passed with no progress. If months pass and Kyiv still stands, it will destroy morale. Only then will most soldiers feel jaded and cynical. We're not even a week into this war, and plus Russia's been sanctioned to hell, so there's nothing good to go back home to. The only way is forward.  

Ukraine's mission remains the same: last as long as possible. The longer they stand, the harsher it will be for Russia. But even if Kyiv were to fall today, the hatred is so strong Russia can expect insurgency for a very long time. Every puppet will be dispatched, and attacks will spill over the border into Russian territory.

The risk remains high, but still is just a risk at this point since the only two countries shooting eachother are Russia and Ukraine, When fighting breaks out on another continent or even country, or if western militarys go to Ukraine, I think thats when the world war discussion starts.

It would appear that this is just the leading up to a world wide conflict. Similar to the period before WWII, there was alot of these regional skirmishes, treaties, declarations, etc before it ended up as a full blown conflict on every continent. 

I think we should be careful about labeling this a world war already, when its still just in Ukraine currently.

 >The Winter War, also known as First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II; the war ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.
 
**[Simo Häyhä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_Häyhä)** 
 
 >Simo Häyhä (Finnish: [ˈsimo ˈhæy̯hæ] (listen); 17 December 1905 –  1 April 2002), often referred to by his nickname, The White Death, was a Finnish military sniper in World War II during the 1939–1940 Winter War against the Soviet Union. He used a Finnish-produced M/28-30, a variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle. Häyhä had also used a submachine gun, the Suomi KP/-31. He is believed to have killed over 500 men during the Winter War, the highest number of sniper kills in any major war.
