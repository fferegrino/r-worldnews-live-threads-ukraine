Day 72 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was much quieter than yesterday. We heard shelling only a couple times at most and it wasn’t all that close to us. Still, when we come out to the balcony facing Belgorod we can hear a lot of explosions in the distance, which is most likely related to our counteroffensives.

That counteroffensive that was announced today was massive. Liberating five and a half settlements is just great, soon Russians will actually be pushed back far enough that they won’t be able to shell us that easily. Though I’m still not sure if Tsyrkuny is liberated, I don’t remember hearing any reports about it being liberated, and some maps still mark it as occupied by Russians, but at the same time our forces are already pushing Cherkaski Tyshky which could mean that Tsyrkuny is actually liberated.

There is apparently more good news about our counteroffensives, including around Kherson, but they can’t tell us about them yet. We also heard about Russians actually retreating from around Kharkiv to go help on other directions, does this mean Kharkiv front was another one of their “brilliant” feints like Kyiv? 

Soon we will hear “Yeah, we were just pretending to attack Kharkiv, and totally didn’t have it as day 1 goal, and those convoys being destroyed on the streets of Kharkiv in the first days of the invasion? Those were paid actors, they are just playing dead. It was yet another brilliant feint of the Russian army!”

Iowa Class US WWII Battleship: 57,500 long tons fully loaded.  
Russian Cruiser Moskva: 11,500 long tons fully loaded.  
Arleigh Burke US Destroyer: 9,500 long tons fully loaded.  
US Legend Class Coast Guard Cutters: 4,500 long tons fully loaded  
Russian Frigate Admiral Makarov: 4,000 long tons fully loaded.  
Russia Corvette, Steregushchiy Class: 2,000 long tons fully loaded  
Russian Raptor class patrol boats: 23 long tons displacement

So the closest thing the US has to a Russian Frigate is the Legend Class Cutter, but the Markov has a crew of 200 (Cutter has 113) and of course the US Cutters don't have anti ship or anti air missiles like the Markov does because they're not really designed for modern warfare (they're designed for interdiction and rescue). 

The thing that would make this such a huge loss to Russia (if true, and I hope it's true) is that they just don't have a lot of Naval power, very little of it is in the Black Sea Fleet.  And of course morale.  Huge boost for Ukraine and huge hit to Russia, who can no longer claim that the Moskva was some sort of a one-off.

> Everyone has noticed that the reasons for invading Ukraine are identical to what Hitler said when he attacked Poland. To be exact: it’s to defend our borders, the security of the Reich, and the oppressed German minority in Poland. Danzig was always a German city. Germany has the right to regain sovereignty over German territory. The liberal world is lying: we want peace, we patiently offered to slow the proliferation of armaments. But Poland broke off peace talks and mobilized its citizens. We aren’t fighting the population. Our aviation is only attacking military targets. Anybody who uses bombs or chemical weapons will get a devastating response. We’re prepared to fight everyone.   

> When you read Hitler’s speech from September 1, 1939, you just can’t believe your eyes. At first I even thought it might be a Ukrainian fake. The night before the war, I got a similar shock from the reports of Ukrainian saboteurs invading Russia: a direct calque of the Gleiwitz incident. And on June 22, Hitler explained to the German people that there were 160 Russian divisions on the border ready to invade Europe. I don’t know who came up with this nasty joke, history in general or some specific cynics out there.

At this stage names can be taken off or added at member state discretion, an EU Commission source said.

The EU has not officially signed off on the draft proposal but could do so as early as this morning at a meeting of EU ambassadors -- currently underway in Brussels. 

“Discussions are going on. It’s not a piece of cake, but we have to wait and see,” said one of the diplomatic sources.

Kabaeva was first linked to Putin more than a decade ago, while she was a medal-winning gymnast. Putin has denied a relationship with her.

In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials had been debating whether or not to place sanctions on Kabaeva over concerns that the move might escalate tensions even more because it could be seen as an extreme personal blow to Putin.

bb77b23580a5a7844ecb46247d384eb3,ujezt4,i7mvrot,"Ok. So this why I believe Ukraine’s estimates of Russian troops killed so far. 

Keep in mind these numbers are very rough estimates that are purely based on social media and general media reports that I’ve been reading far too much of in the last 72 days.

I was puzzled by Ukrainian estimates early on in this war and didn’t really believe them. But the tank losses seemed be be consistent with things like OSINT counts of documented losses.

Then there were reported slips by Russian media where numbers were put up and then taken down that seemed consistent with Ukrainian claims. That made me wonder.

It’s only in the last 3-4 weeks I’ve come to believe them, purely because of Russias stalled offensive and a rough napkin calculation of what that would say about Russia’s loss of combat power as estimated by troop numbers.

With an assumption of a contested airspace, and roughly even ground technology, you need roughly 3 times the troop numbers to take urban centres. And about 1.5 times troop numbers to take prepared defences on open ground. 

Izyum and it’s surrounds is the last time Russia has made any ground as far as I’m aware.

Estimates of functional Ukrainian military are a tightly held secret. The best numbers I’ve seen at the start of the war of are about 120k plus 20k foreign fighters (140k total). Most of whom are now distributed between Kharkiv and Kherson. The best estimate of Ukrainian military deaths is about 8k. Assuming about a 4 to 1 injury ratio - Ukraine has probably sustained approximately 40k casualties over the war so far (about 8k dead and 32k injured).

This leaves an estimate of somewhere around a total of 140k - 40k = 100k Ukraine troops in the Kharkiv to Kherson theatre of war.

Russias offensive capability was originally about 180k troops (approx 120 BTGS, including support staff) plus there has been another approximately 40k troops added by Russia during the last 2 months (30 BTGs plus support staff). Thus the total number (and this is a very rough estimate) of Russian troops committed to the war so far is about 220k.

Ukraine claims to have now killed about 25k Russian troops. Assuming a lower rate of only 2-3 injuries per death due to poor medical support, Russia has had somewhere around 75-100k casualties in total.

So if you take 75k from 220k, Russias estimated troops in Ukraine is now about 145k. 

Ukraine has about 100k.

So the ratio of combat power as estimated by troop number is now 1 vs 1.45.

This is under the 1.5 to 1 ratio that is needed for Russia to take ground off the Ukrainians. Which is consistent with what we see on the field.

If the number of injuries to death is more like 3 to 1 then the ratio of total troop numbers is more like 100k Ukraine to 120k Russia.

Given that Russia has concentrated its forces around the Donbas from Izyum to Mariupol, then Ukraine may actually have more combat power in Kharkiv and Kherson. Which is why Russia is actually losing ground there. Again this is consistent with about 25k Russian troops killed.",1651893140.0,1651892844.0,t3_ujezt4,t3_ujezt4,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Ukraine and Germany have had a somewhat strained relationship since the Russian invasion, but this appears to be a step forward.

Germany has previously been accused of being too soft on Russia, although it has since made efforts to take stronger action.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now said his nation's foreign minister will travel to Ukraine on an official visit.

The German government had got into a spat with Ukraine's ambassador in Berlin after Kyiv appeared to snub an offer of a visit from Germany's president.

It is unclear exactly when foreign minister Annalena Baerbock will visit Kyiv.

*Europeans understand the necessity of difficult decisions in the energy sector but lack the political courage to take them. This is why American leadership in the current situation is so vital.*  
  
*The US has already imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia but can still go much further. Efforts to coordinate sanctions with Europe risk hampering this process. Instead, America could take a lead by targeting more Russian banks and seizing assets belonging to the Russian Federation. Tougher sanctions measures must be accompanied by clear messaging that there will be no return to business as usual until Russia not only ends the war but also fully compensates Ukraine for the destruction it has caused.*  
  
*This last point is particularly important as many in Europe still seem to think the war in Ukraine will somehow eventually resolve itself. They appear to believe that Russia will achieve some of its goals and will propose a settlement that Ukraine will have to accept. At that point, everything will go back to normal and all the companies who left the Russian market will return.*  
  
*It is up to the United States to leave both Russia and Europe in no doubt that this is not going to happen. Ukraine will not be forced to accept any peace deals against its will and there will be no business as usual with Vladimir Putin.*

🔻 Today was a busy day, which began and ended with decorating our heroes - our defenders. On the occasion of Infantry Day, the professional holiday for Ukrainian soldiers, I met with our military in the morning.
Thank you for your service. I presented awards, including our new military award.

🔻 Our country had no military awards until recently. And I had the honor to finally present such an award today - the Cross of Military Merit.

And the first person whom I decided to decorate with this Cross was General Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of #Ukraine. For courage, for wisdom, for organizing an effective resistance to the Russian invasion.I am sure that the Russian army will remember it for a long time.

🔻 A special award ""For Courage and Valor"" was also established for combat units that showed extraordinary courage and effectiveness in the battles for Ukraine. Seven brigades received it.

I also decorated our defenders, who received the title of Hero of #Ukraine, with the Order of the Golden Star. And also to the relatives of those our heroes who received this title posthumously.

🔻 We continue the evacuation mission from #Mariupol, namely from #Azovstal, with the mediation of the #UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the day, our team organized rescue for over 40 civilians - women and children.We hope that soon they will arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling spent in underground shelters. We are also working on diplomatic options to save our military remaining at Azovstal. Influential mediators are involved.

🔻 Russian troops continued shelling our territory, including with missiles and airstrikes. I ask all our citizens - and especially these days - not to ignore the air raid alerts. Also, strictly follow the public order and curfew regulations in cities and communities.Please observe the ban on visiting forests in the occupied area. There remains a threat of mines and tripwires left by the Russian military.

🔻 We held a meeting in #Kyiv with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states.We are grateful for their consistent support of our fighting the Russian invasion from the first day. And, as always, we talked thoroughly and with benefit for Ukraine. We are coordinating our steps to increase pressure on #Russia.

🔻 I also took part in a discussion at the very influential British expert platform Chatham House, presenting our initiative to update the global security architecture for the world to have the tools to react promptly to any external aggression.

🔻 I addressed the Parliament of #Iceland, thanking the Government and the people of Iceland for supporting the sanctions needed to deter #Russia. I also called on Icelandic politicians, diplomats, and ordinary citizens to help defend our freedom.

**US Lend-Lease – Russia Gets Nervous**

*Judging by the reaction of Russian propagandists, the news has greatly alarmed the Kremlin. The April 28 decision creates a simplified procedure to supply any types of weapons to Ukraine and other countries, including Poland.*  
  
*The administrators of the pro-Kremlin Telegram channels agreed that the decision — coming on the same day as President Biden’s announcement of an additional $20bn for military aid to Ukraine — will now drag on and could become a “new Afghanistan” for Russia. The propagandists listed the advanced weaponry that Ukraine stands to receive and predicted that from now on “the entire territory of Europe will become a space for massive armed confrontation with Russia for years to come.” Some of the authors acknowledged that the new program “will deprive Russia of local technological and military superiority.”*  
  
*Others put on a brave face and observed that similar deliveries “didn’t really help the Afghan national army”, but at the same time advised the Russian military to quickly “grind down the enemy’s manpower, and then deprive it of the physical ability to deliver foreign weapons to the left bank of the Dnieper, at the same time destroying any warehouses.”*

**Historian Timothy Snyder: Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine Is a Colonial War**

*We speak to Yale University historian Timothy Snyder about his latest article for The New Yorker, “The War in Ukraine Is a Colonial War.” Snyder writes about the colonial history that laid the foundations for the Russian war in Ukraine, such as Russia’s imperial vision and how leaders including Hitler and Stalin have aimed to conquer Ukrainian soil on different premises. “The whole history of colonialism … involves denying that another people is real. It involves denying that another state is real,” says Snyder. “That is, of course, the premise of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”*

Yurii Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson regional Council, told Ukrainian television Friday: ""The way out of city has been complicated. There are some cases when people managed to get out, even by a bus, but most people get turned back. All the junctions are blocked.""

Sobolevskyi claimed that ""there are cases when they [Russian forces] commit abuses at the check-points: very thorough frisking, forcing men to undress, looking for tattoos.""

Russian soldiers frequently check Ukrainian civilians for what they see as nationalist and neo-Nazi tattoos.

Sobolevskyi said that mobile connections and internet access had been restored so that people in Kherson could communicate with their families in other parts of Ukraine.

He said the Russians were trying to introduce the ruble on an experimental basis in some communities.

Some context: The southern city of Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to fall under Russian control, and since then scores of people have been trying to flee.

(A fairly long excerpt...)

> Ukrainian Villagers Return to Find Their Homes Ripped Apart

> Russian uniforms with orange-and-black St. George’s ribbons are scattered on roadsides. A cellar used by the Russians as a base still has a jar of Russian borscht, and a grenade stuck in a corner. “Kuban,” a region in southern Russia, says the graffiti on the wall.
The level of devastation in the village surpasses what happened during World War II, residents say. 

> “We are so tired of this war,” said Mykola Devyatko, 85, who was 6 when the Nazis were pushed out of Mala Rohan. “The other war was not as bad. Then all they had were a rifle, a machine gun, and maybe Katyusha rockets. Now, with the weapons that they have, they are just leveling everything.”

> In the last incident here, Stepanky, a hamlet about a mile north of Mala Rohan, was hit by Russian shelling on April 21—just before the recent Ukrainian offensive that moved the front lines further north. Shrapnel killed Natalia Danilchenko’s 32-year-old nephew. “He was sitting there, waiting for humanitarian aid, and a shell just flew in from God knows where,” she said. “I buried him the next day, on my 63rd birthday.”

> Two Mala Rohan villagers have been killed and one woman was raped by a drunk Russian soldier during the occupation, local officials and villagers say.  Mr. Kotov said a Russian soldier came to his home, trying to trade bread—mostly unavailable at the time—for cigarettes. “He said, we have come to protect you,” Mr. Kotov recalled, “and my wife asked him: from whom?”

> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “has brought 200,000 Nazis to attack you,” the soldier replied, he said. Soon after, Russian troops started telling villagers to prepare for evacuation to Russia, something that they have done across the occupied areas of Ukraine.
“Evacuation is the scariest word. After they said it, I was too afraid to step outside. I don’t want to go to Russia, but if they force you to go under the gun, you have to go. Even if they use us as human shields,” said Natalia Menshenina, 65. At the end of the day, the Russians never got around to taking away residents of Mala Rohan. Ms. Menshenina says she still lives in her cellar because all the windows in her house have been shot out.

> Most of the damage occurred when the Russians were expelled from the village. On that day, Ms. Zlubina’s farm on the edge of the village caught fire, with 140 heads of cattle dying, she said. “As a going-away present, they just burned it all down,” she said. She managed to save hundreds of other animals, mostly pigs. “I’d like to rebuild, but who will fund it now? By myself, I just can’t afford it,” she said.

> Vasily Perepelitsa, 77, grimaced as he recalled the village’s experience with the Russian army.

> “Russia has covered itself in disgrace from head to toes here. Nobody ever expected the Russians to do this until I saw it with my own eyes,” he said. “And when they were escaping our village, they were escaping like dogs. Firing left and right, at random. They didn’t leave a single window or door that wasn’t shot through.”

> 'On Chechens' 
> When I came to Rubizhne, the Chechen unit was already there stationed somewhere in the 5-storey houses. I had no info about their participation in assault operations. I only saw staged videos of them 'clearing up' 5-storey houses which were captured and cleared by someone else a few weeks earlier. 

> Folks from the household service of our company continuously suffered from oppression by the Chechens. Chechens were stationed at a checkpoint which had to be crossed to reach the well and get water. Each trip ended up in conflicts. Either a 40-litre water canister would be taken away, or a generator, or something else. 

> Our fighters were fuming: we are dying from mortars, while they have awesome contracts yet never go to the frontline. Saying 'We came to fight, not die! I personally didn't hear these words from the Chechens, I'm saying what our fighters were saying.

> I bumped into them on the frontline in mid-April. Our group's frontier was crossed by reconnaissance, as I understand to discover firing positions inside buildings. The Chechen fighter groups were meant to be going after them to destroy the discovered points. 

> The Chechens were very dapper - expensive kevlar vests and helmets, full equipment on the outside - collimators, grenade launchers, tactical stocks, pouches wherever possible, everyone had radios, excellent footwear and uniform. Very rich. Ramzan *Akhmatov* didn't spare any money on them.

> Reconnaissance enters the marked area, opens up positions, the noisy crowd of Chechens follows through from behind the building and the party begins:

> - AllahuAkbarAllahuAkbarAllahuAkbarAllahuAkbarAllahuAkbar!!! Pew-pew-pew-pew-boom-boom! Wild yelling and shooting, Scouts come out: 
> - F*ck, such dangerous guys. Our folks went through, while these jumped out and started shooting in all directions.

> Chechens have one 300th, he's immediately sent to the rear. Another one got a bullet in the head. The bullet was armour-piercing, penetrated right through two walls of the kevlar helmet. The soft shell stayed in the first wall, the solid core went further. Bullet penetrated the helmet but came out over the skull - the guy was lucky. He fell from the impact, received a concussion, but stayed alive. 

> We were starting to get shelled from mortars, headed down into cellar. Sitting there, waiting, chatting. The guys are alright, but completely bonkers about religion. Sometimes it reached total absurd.

> Part of our group went to assault in the morning. One of them was a young 20-year old fella. He had problems with heart even before the war, but here he didn't sleep all night standing guard, had some running to do during assault, also stress, also panic fear - he was really afraid of death. In short, he had a heart attack. When he was brought to the frontier his heart already stopped. 

> The group commander - very clever young man, with a few powerful punches in the chest managed to restart his heart. The guy is suffocating, throwing up water, dying. We requested evac and waited for it in a building. On the table is a jar of candied honey. A Chechen standing next to it. Says: - He needs a spoonful of honey now. Prophet Muhammad was saying that honey is the best cure of all diseases.

> F*ck. What's in their heads? The guy was saved, by the way. When he was dragged to the vehicle, he said he was cold and asked to not let him die. Right now he's all good - already home. A bit later, the same Chechen tells me: - Find scissors. - Erm... did you find the youngest guy here to find you scissors?
> - You don't get it. I want to do you good. Now the second Chechen pulls out scissors and gives to him. And he starts trimming my moustache: - Prophet Muhammad says that food should not touch the moustache. Food that touches it becomes bad. It's the 21st century.

> A day after I accidentally ended up at the morning meeting with battalion commander. Over there Chechen fighters were receiving assault objectives in the quarter. A clever Chechen in good Russian was translating the objectives for them in Chechen - many don't speak Russian anymore. As far as I'm aware, they fought well, had no losses.
The rumours now are that it were the Chechens who decided the outcome of hostilities in Rubizhne by storming Ukrainian trenches. But I have no concrete data.

**The Russian Public Is Being Primed for Another of Putin’s Wars**

*(...)*

*Russian state TV pundits and propagandists took Putin’s message to heart and snapped into action. Appearing on 60 Minutes the day after Putin’s speech, Igor Korotchenko warned: “Let’s be straightforward about it: World War III is knocking at our door. It will come from the direction of Poland and Ukraine.” Korotchenko argued that Russia can fight back against alleged Western provocations by demonstrating its military might: “We need to grab the West by the udders, they should feel our hand and we should feel their fearful pulse... The best defense is an offense... Our military fist should be at the face of every Western politician.”*

*(...)*

*Adding fuel to the fire, host Vladimir Soloviev asked: “Then why should we stop at Ukraine? Why not solve all of our problems at once?” Soloviev argued that since it’s unlikely that the major world powers would resort to nuclear war, Russia can move forward with achieving its objectives undeterred: “If we have to end up behind the Iron Curtain, why not collect some more lands and peoples first?”*

For a country thrust into war after its neighbor decided to invade, and not being able to logistically and efficiently put together/arm and deploy foreign legions comes as little surprise. During the initial stages of the war Ukraine had to simultaneously handle the evacuation of *millions* of civilians, coordinate defense across the entire theatre (three attack axis), all while the central government and capital was under immediate threat from the opening days. 

Compounding the multitude problems of the foreign legion, I would guess, would have been the large amount of war tourist and self proclaimed ""billy bad-asses"" showing up in droves eager to fight. A majority of which can't read/write/speak the local language. What competent and efficient  military resources could Ukraine have possibly spared to cater to these people? Outside of rear eschelon military support and humanitarian tasks - I'm failing to see it. 

Also unskilled/unaware foreign fighters are an enormous liability to international and domestic PR/morale. To have poorly equipped/trained foreign fighters sent immediately to the front to be slaughtered is not effective messaging. Which is what's (apparently) happening to the few who eventually make it to see real high intensity combat. 

Wali by his own admission finally made it relatively close to the front. Where he was able to shoot at the windows of buildings occupied by the Russians. Due to Wali's trench mate's lack of concealment and cover discipline (and not heeding Wali's advice) two of these foreign fighters were obliterated by a tank round in extremely close proximity. From what I gather, that was enough to make Wali, who is a very expierenced warfighter, rapidly re-evaluate his presence in Ukraine. Which in my opinion - is absolultly ***fair***.

Suffice to say these last 70 days have been excruciatingly difficult for Ukraine; from the front-line soldier all the way up to Zelensky. I'm certain the road between both foreign fighter and the Ukrainian military was/is paved with good intentions, I'm still suprised at what a lot of the expectations were and continue to be for these foreign fighters.

As a personal aside - When I,  naively, mulled the idea of going over to help (like many others), it would have required me to make significant sacrifices for my family and my relatively comfertable life. Ultimately, I wasn't willing (Afraid) to make the sacrifices required. Seeing these foreign fighters return home in droves, many with tail tucked, reminds me that **it's okay not to want to go die in another country** and **it's okay to say that, even after the fact**. Additionally, it only increases my appreciation for the bravery of the Ukrainian warfighter. It also highlights the indiscriminate brutality and horror that Russia is wreaking for it's own imperialist gain.

I'm constantly reminded of this silly qoute from HBO's Band of Brothers, when Lt. Spears, councils Pvt. Blythe on why the Pvt is to terrified to leave his foxhole and fight the enemy:

""The only hope you have is to accept the fact that you're already dead. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll be able to function as a soldier is supposed to function...All war depends on it.""

Which in my (insignificant) opinion is the true demarcation. Ukrainian soldiers by choice or by decree are prepared to die, many of these foreign fighters seemingly never considered the ultimate consequences of their courageous choice to raise their hand and volunteer.

Lastly and more importantly, there have been dozens of foreigners now, who bravely and without hesistation took up arms to fight for Ukraine agaisnt Russia's unjust and evil war. Foreigners who have laid down there lives, or worse have been captured by Russian forces - and ***that sacrifice*** for someone eles's home is significant. We should not forget them.

It started as a rumor in a tweet that even had the wrong image to represent the ship. The supposed footage that came out is from a video game. You can clearly tell it's not real, just from the speed at which the supposed plane is going around the ship. The plane would have to be an sr-71 to go that fast. It's literally needs to go many km per second if you think about it. There were no unusual radio communications. And the most recent satellite images that were taken right after the rumor started don't show any smoke or fire. Also, people pointing out that there are more planes out right now are just missing the point. If you had looked at flightradar at any point in this war, you would have seen roughly the same number of planes in the same area. There is nothing out of the ordinary going on.

This guy's tweet was amplified on twitter, picked up by some lazy journalists and then cited as a source on other media. Then it amplified to the point that Forbes is talking about it. What the hell is going on?

From CNN's Henrik Pettersson and Niamh Kennedy 

NATO could increase its presence around the Baltic Sea and Swedish borders if Sweden decides to apply for membership of the alliance, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday. 

When asked during an interview with Swedish public broadcaster SVT how NATO would protect Sweden during the potential application process, Stoltenberg said:

""There are different ways to do it. But I am convinced that we will find solutions for the security needs Sweden will have in a transitional period from the time Sweden applies until it becomes a member.""

Stoltenberg stressed that ""from the moment"" Sweden decides to apply and NATO says it wants Sweden to join, ""there is a very strong commitment from NATO to be able to guarantee Sweden’s security.""

""We have different ways of marking it, including through increased presence of NATO and NATO forces in the area around Sweden and the Baltic Sea,"" the secretary general continued. 

Finland and Sweden are both considering potential applications to the alliance following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde told a press conference on April 29 that no decision on membership will made before May 13, when an analysis report from the Swedish parliament on membership is set to be delivered. 

Finland's membership decision also hinges on a government security report. A senior Western diplomat said Thursday that the Finnish Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to draft a response on the Finnish government’s security report as early as May 11. ",False,1651809744.0,t3_ujezt4,t3_ujezt4,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

>Second, Flagshtok reported that almost at the same time residents of the border town of Zlynka (Bryansk oblast, Russia, 40 km from Ziabrauka) saw an explosion over the town and a cloud of smoke after it.

>Judging by the cloud, we can say that it could be both the self-destruction of the missile in the air and the trail from the missile  that was shot down.

**Putin to send 'doomsday' warning to West at Russia's WW2 victory parade**

*LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin will send a ""doomsday"" warning to the West when he leads celebrations on Monday marking the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, brandishing Russia's vast firepower while its forces fight on in Ukraine.*  
  
*Defiant in the face of deep Western isolation since he ordered the invasion of Russia's neighbour, Putin will speak on Red Square before a parade of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles.*  
  
*A fly-past over St Basil's Cathedral will include supersonic fighters, Tu-160 strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 ""doomsday"" command plane, which would carry Russia's top brass in the event of a nuclear war, the Defence Ministry said.*  
  
*In that scenario, the Il-80 is designed to become the roaming command centre for the Russian president. It is packed with technology but specific details are Russian state secrets.*

> My father-in-law went to protect Ukraine 2 months ago. **Now the state says he's never been enlisted. It faked him being in territorial defense, even paying him like he is.** Yet he's on the front lines in Luhansk right now with no proper ammunition or support.

[…]

> **The situation is real. How I wish it wasn't but it is. Nothing in life is truly black or white, and you need to keep that in mind. Corruption was strong in Ukraine, and it still is.** War hasn't changed anything, it only made things worse.

>There are numerous women who contacted local authorities to clarify the situation but there's no response. Arrogant men in uniforms spread their hands, finger-point, and ignore any applications.
 
>We've forwarded our official application to the @DefenceU, awaiting their answer. We've provided all the documents we were able to get. **Now, authorities refuse to provide even those documents for families that reached out just a single day later.**

> I'm writing this in English because I'm sickened to my heart of all zombified Ukrainians trying to convince me I'm pro-Russian and this is propaganda on my part. I'm ashamed of those people, but I'm happy they've not faced injustice and remain in the brighter world.

>**I want Ukraine and her people to have a bright future. And while corruption rots so many instances, that future will not be possible. If you haven't faced injustice yourself, it doesn't mean it's not there. It's there. It's always been.**

Seeing the price of gas almost double what it was a before the invasion, while I blame Russia and Saudi Arabia for playing games with the global economy to fuel egos, could embittered many working class Americans to the Europeans for depending on Russian oil pre invasion, or creating a market that places higher demand for non-Russian oil post invasion. Much like how many Americans have held hostile view towards Europe's until recent lax defense spending which was seen as a cause for the US defense spending being as high as it was, rightly or wrongly. 

My main concern is either a waive if isolationist thinking spreading across the US, or a collapse of the US economy since most people's method of transportation would have to change dramatically in a short time, or budgets won't keep up with rising prices. I think Russia was fucked anyway, since over the long run they wouldn't be able to out produce the west. But a withdrawal of the US from Europe by economic or political collapse, or a failing of the entire western economy might stop the support Ukraine is seeing, and maybe even leave all of eastern Europe vulnerable to a slower Russian advance via fifth column or whatever bs euphemism Russia uses for state sponsored terrorism.

I wouldn't ask Europe to undo the embargo, but I do think that after this conflict stabilizes and they get their energy needs sorted, there should be a cost they should pay for abandoning domestic energy production and buying from Russia when they were warned against it by the US, on both sides of the isle. I think helping the US and Mexico deal with the cartels, or some other issue that the OAS faces and Europe either over simplifies or ignores would be fair. Or they could let the US come in to examine how they treat the Roma and Travelers. Or maybe let us overhaul the structure of the EU so that it would be a proper federal system where the average European person has someone in an equivalent to the house of representatives that they can use to effect change in the European parliament.

For him the greatest shame was, working in Dresden and seeing Soviet Union fall and not seeing something great replace it.

>As a 37-year-old KGB lieutenant colonel stationed in the East German city of Dresden, Putin watched nervously as angry crowds stormed the city’s huge Stasi compound in December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the end of Soviet control in Europe. Overrunning the offices of the East German secret police, the crowds moved on to its inner sanctum: the KGB headquarters. **Putin called for armed backup to protect the employees and the sensitive files hidden inside**, but was told no help would come. “Moscow is silent,” said the voice on the line. **He had no choice but to go outside and lie to the crowds that he had heavily armed men waiting inside who would shoot anyone who tried to enter**. The bluff worked, the mob dissipated and the KGB’s files on informers and agents remained safe.  
>  
>Putin felt he was watching one of the largest and most powerful empires the world had ever seen **unravel in the most pathetic and humiliating way.** “I had the feeling that the country was no more,” he recalled later in a series of interviews published in 2000. “It had disappeared.”  
>  
>He seemed to **mourn not the human cost or material tribulations, but the national humiliation of a powerful state simply imploding**. He later claimed to have had a sense for some time that the collapse of Soviet power in Europe was inevitable. “**But I wanted something different to rise in its place.** And nothing different was proposed. That’s what hurt. They just dropped everything and went away.”

Appeasement didn't work back then and it didn't work now, the sanctions that happened now should have happened in 2014 if not earlier probably.

>DONBASS. HEROISM IS SUPERFLUOUS. IT DOES NOT EXIST WHERE EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN. We are going ahead heroically. There is an old proverb: ""Someone's heroism is the result of someone else's mistakes.""
We cannot take Novomikhailovka, Marinka, Avdeevka or Peski. Military forces of the DPR and Russia are storming Ukrainian Army and Nazi positions. They are heroic. They cannot penetrate the enemy defence from Donetsk. We all understand and will not go into details. 

Another translation in the twitter thread had the word ""Excessive"" instead of ""Superflous"" which I think is more accurate. My take is there is to much heroism as RU forces keep throwing themselves into the meat grinder - alluding that this needless ""heroism"" wouldn't be nessecary had RU leadership not miscalulated the offensive so badly.

Two months after answering President Volodymyr Zelensky's call, sniper Wali is back in Quebec - unharmed, though he almost died ""several times. But most foreign fighters who went to Ukraine like him came back bitterly disappointed, mired in the fog of war without having even been to the front once.

""I'm lucky to be alive, it was really close,"" said the former Royal 22e Régiment soldier, in an interview with La Presse at his home in the greater Montreal area.

His last mission in the Donbass region, as part of a Ukrainian unit supporting conscript soldiers, hastened his return in a way. In the early morning hours, when he had just taken up position near a trench exposed to Russian tank fire, two of the conscripts came out of their cover to smoke a cigarette. ""I told them not to expose themselves like that, but they didn't listen to me,"" says Wali. Then a ""very accurate"" shell from a Russian tank exploded next to them. The scene described by the sniper is bloodcurdling. ""It exploded solid. I saw the shrapnel go by like lasers. My body tensed up. I couldn't hear anything, my head hurt right away. It was really violent.

He immediately realized there was nothing he could do for his two Ukrainian brothers-in-arms who had been hit hard. ""It smelled like death, it's hard to describe; it's a macabre smell of charred flesh, sulfur and chemicals. It's so inhuman, that smell.""

His spouse, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he called her in the middle of the night about an hour later. ""He was trying to explain to me that there had been two deaths. He was telling me, 'I think I've done enough, right? I've done enough?"" It was like he wanted me to tell him to come back,"" she confides. He was awfully quiet.""

Ultimately, it was her family life that outweighed her desire to help the Ukrainians, Wali says. ""My heart wants to go back to the front. I still have the fire. I love the theater of operations. But I pushed my luck. I have no injuries. I say to myself: how far can I roll the dice? I don't want to lose what I have here,"" says the young father, who missed his son's first birthday while at the front.

After spending two months in Ukraine, Wali's assessment of the deployment of Western volunteer fighters, which began in early March following a call from President Volodymyr Zelensky, is ""rather disappointing. The number of volunteers who came forward - more than 20,000, according to various estimates - was so large that the Ukrainian government had to urgently create the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine on March 6.

But for most of the volunteers who showed up at the border, joining a military unit was a hassle.

Zelensky made an appeal to all, but on the ground, the officers were completely helpless. They didn't know what to do with us.

He and several other ex-Canadian soldiers initially preferred to join the Normandy Brigade, a private volunteer unit based for several months in Ukraine, led by a former Quebec soldier whose nom de guerre is Hrulf.

Dissension quickly set in among the troops and a large number of fighters deserted the Normandy Brigade.

Three people who requested anonymity described to La Presse promises of weapons and protective equipment made by the leader of the Normandy Brigade that never materialized. Some of the volunteers found themselves some 40 kilometers from the Russian front without any protective gear. ""If there had been a Russian breakthrough, everyone would have been at risk. It was an irresponsible attitude on the part of the Brigade,"" says one of its former soldiers, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons.

The commander of the Normandy Brigade, who also asked us to withhold his real name for security reasons, confirms that he has been abandoned by about 60 fighters since the beginning of the conflict. Many of them wanted to sign a contract that would have given them status under the Geneva Conventions, as well as guarantees that they would be cared for by the Ukrainian state if they were injured. Hrulf claims that some even ""conned"" him out of a $500,000 shipment of weapons provided by Americans to create their own combat unit.

""There were guys who were in a hurry to go to the front without even being screened. The Ukrainians tested us, and only now are we starting to get more missions. There is an element of trust that needs to be built up, and that is quite normal,"" says Hrulf.
A ""terrible disappointment""

""Many volunteer soldiers expect it to be turnkey, but the war is the opposite, it's a terrible disappointment,"" says Wali.

With another Quebec infantryman nicknamed Shadow, the Quebec sniper finally joined a Ukrainian unit fighting in the Kyiv region.

But again, finding a firearm to fight with was a Kafkaesque exercise. ""You had to know someone who knew someone who told you that in such and such an old barber shop, they would provide you with an AK-47. You had to cobble together a soldier's kit like that by picking up bits and pieces of ammunition left and right, in many cases with weapons in varying degrees of condition,"" he recounts.

Even for meals, civilians often provide them. It's the same for gasoline to get around in a vehicle. You constantly have to organize yourself, to know someone who knows someone.

After a few weeks on Ukrainian territory, some of the more experienced Western soldiers were eventually recruited by the Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate, and are now reportedly involved in special operations behind enemy lines, according to one of them.

Others, less experienced, are ""jumping from one Airbnb to another"" while waiting to be recruited by a unit that will take them to the front lines, Wali says.

The majority, however, have decided to return home, say several people interviewed for this article. ""Many arrive in Ukraine with their chests puffed out, but leave with their tails between their legs,"" Wali said.


In the end, he himself says he only fired two bullets into windows ""to scare people"" and never really came within range of the enemy. ""It's a machine war,"" where ""extremely brave"" Ukrainian soldiers take very heavy casualties from shells, but ""miss a lot of opportunities"" to weaken the enemy because they lack technical military knowledge, he summarizes. ""If the Ukrainians had the procedures we had in Afghanistan for communicating with artillery, we could have made a killing,"" he believes.

But Wali doesn't hide his desire to go back anyway. ""You never know when foreign fighters will make a difference on the ground. It's like a fire extinguisher: it's useless until the fire catches.",False,1651836340.0,t3_ujezt4,t1_i7jh6zc,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

They collapse if they don't continue to make conquests (steal.)

TLDR, she's a very capable vessel on paper, she's one on the newest combat vessels of the Russian navy. Although, I think everyone is legitimately questioning the effectiveness of just about every Russian combat platform. I suspect that there are also significant questions as to the capability of the Russian navy to function at anything larger than a small task force looking at how poor their command and control is. Also, Russia has a huge amount of ocean to cover and their assets are stretched very thin. Many of those assets are also outdated Soviet platforms that are in questionable states of repair.

Back when the foreign legion was first brought up on here I said 'dont go if you don't speak the language, it's a bitch of a barrier'.

And was slaughtered by dozens of replies, hundreds of downvotes, and even referral to Reddits mental health bot. Lots of 'you're an idiot, haven't you heard of translators?' etc.

So it seems like yeah, just popping in up in a country that speaks a totally different structure of language means that you're just getting your dumb ass in the way.

With the bridge destroyed this gives a huge advantage to Ukraine. Now the people who made the website counting down until Monday for it to be blown are either trolls or a clever attempt by Ukraine to draw attention to it making Russians scramble that they have to pick if it is a credible threat or a trolling attempt. If they move troops back to Russia before and it blows then Ukraine is + and if they don't then Russia is -


So I think the countdown to monday is only to troll Russians but I believe they will destroy it either before or after as recapturing crimea would be a massive MASSIVE victory for Ukraine and allowing them to retake Mariupol after.

But that s just my opinion. The southern part of UA is what have worried me for weeks. To UA I think Crimea is way way more important to retake now than Dombas because of the control of the sea and the possibility to block any Russian ships from crossing into and out of that pocket.

So they forced most of the people to evacuate, and those that are still there are still trying to get out and away, kidnapped a bunch of citizens, and are left with a smoldering heap of a city. The ONLY thing going in their favor is it just happens to be in the path of their stupid land bridge to Crimea, but with all the destruction of the city, and the Ukrainians never going to just be all ""Yeah OK you can have that"", it just sets them up to have permanent Ukrainian resistance attacks thrown at the city to drive them out, which the Ukrainians can really unload on them since most/all people will be out at that point and there's really nothing left to destroy. 

The Russians can't and won't be able to rebuild anything usable while the Ukrainians repeatedly hit them. And we haven't started delivering on Lend-Lease yet, so more equipment will come in to bolster that effort.

Putin can declare the end of the operation, and then Ukraine will still be in ""Russia GTFO"" mode, which I'm sure Putin will try to spin as ""They attacked us! NOW we're at war!"" and go right back to getting Russia's ass kicked, albeit formally then.

The whole thing is just exceedingly ridiculous, completely avoidable, and without any actual value to the Russians, and still they went ahead with it because they're lead by a blithering, incompetent fool who dreams of grandeur while nursing his inferiority complex, belittling his people into submission so he can damn them all to a pathetic existence of being a pariah state unlike anything the world has seen in our lifetimes, and quite possibly, ever.

I think there’s at least a real chance that he does declare “victory” and dials down offensive operations and instead focuses on defending any ground they’ve gained. But that clearly doesn’t end the war, I assume Ukraine would still fight to take every inch back. 

I think realistically that is Putin’s only play, at some point the “house of cards” will collapse. You can’t manipulate the ruble forever, sanctions will stay in place until Russia withdraws, and eventually Europe will diversify and stop buying Russian gas (this is a separate story but an OIL embargo by the EU means little, the majority of what they import from Russia is GAS, but even still they are working on stopping these imports as well, it will just take time). 

Anyways, point being that the faster this house of cards falls down the worse it is for Putin. The longer he tries to drag this out the more variables are at play and things/circumstances have, at least, the possibility of changing. If he’s not going to escalate, then I have to imagine the only option left is for him to try and drag a stalemate out as long as possible. Even if the only circumstances that change is Russia losing previously held Ukrainian territory, if these losses happen over X amount of time, essentially slowly but surely, then it’s possible to “cover up” said loses, or they aren’t made a big deal at home.

Considering the use of chemical weapons is a seperate but also important red line using nuclear weapons is the next one along.

The western Ukrainian allied countries have already said that the use of chemical weapons would incur severe consequences, whatever that would be. I suspect it would be the economic nuclear option of simply overnight making Russia an economic pariah.

Now, to move onto nuclear weapons if the response is economic nuclear war, then you would expect that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would garner a military response albeit limited.

Whatever happens the response has to be strong enough to make the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine not worth it for Russia / Putin.

You have to remember when the US dropped the 2 on Japan there were no other strategic powers. So there was no response to be had. It would be completely uncharted territory and precedent would have to be set. I think back channel conversations between the US and Russia would essentially have to dictate what would happen after the response. I don’t think it would be instant apocalypse. I hope that it would be Russia fired a single warhead and US responds with a single warhead and then the long conversation gets to be had. The issue with that is Russia invested in tactical nukes whereas the US did not. The US does have the ability to dial down the strength of a warhead, but it would be launched from and register as full strength payload to Russia.

In this case, Western IP can now be bought (imported) and paid for with money made from petroleum exports. At least, this is what the new law is trying to accomplish. Whether this will actually enable Russia to evade the sanctions in any meaningful way is yet to be seen. In my opinion, there is no way Russia will be able to adequately source replacements for every Western good that has been sanctioned that Russia’s economy relies on.

f868b938a3159bc7b6fd10df6b29f1a8,ujezt4,i7k1fs5,"Great question!

The answer is actually pretty simple: The reason we know exactly how much was seized is because, like a lot of foreign reserve everywhere in the world, it was actually held *in the host countries of that currency*.

Basically, Russia had accounts in America and in Europe which were denominated in American Dollars and Euros. The host countries put a freeze on those accounts and, because they were hosted by domestic institutions, they could easily use government oversight powers to get exact numbers on how much money was there. That's how we know how much was seized.

The rest we know because Russia used to issue investment grade bonds to raise money, which meant it needed to advertise and verify the reserves and cash flows that defined its nominal wealth and supported the value of its currency to international investor agencies, credit agencies and central banks. 

Governments hold reserves in host countries because it can be done as virtual currency, which is infinitely more convenient and secure than importing physical cash and keeping it somewhere. $1,000,000 in USD is 10 kg. That means $300,000,000,000 is 30,000 kg, or 30 metric tons. When you're looking to use this money flexibly and to trade it internationally, you don't want to have to lug literal tons of paper around to do it. 

This problem has actually come up for Russia during sanctions with relation to the portion of reserves it holds in gold. Nominally it has something in the range of $130 billion in gold (price varying with market). The problem is, moving that amount of gold would take a full cargo train and storing it requires an expensive high grade Fort Knox style fortified storehouse, making actually selling it a logistical nightmare, effectively diminishing its value if you actually ever need to trade it in.",False,1651846214.0,t3_ujezt4,t1_i7jw0fc,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

""Foreign currency reserves"" are almost entirely comprised of balances owed by the respective country's central bank to your central bank: so Russia's US Dollar reserves are amounts owed to them by the Fed; their Euro reserves are amounts owed to them by the ECB; etc.  So Western central banks know exactly how much they owed to Russia, and therefore what are the exact balances they have now frozen.

Gold reserves are either held in your own vaults, or are held by some gold dealer on your behalf in their vaults (because physically moving gold around is expensive and risky).  Many of the big gold dealers are based in the US, and I understand some significant proportion of Russia's gold reserves have been frozen there.  Again, the amounts will be known to the respective authorities.

The remaining, unfrozen, reserves are either physically located in Russia or are owed to them by friendly states.  We have less insight into these, and mostly rely on reports issued by the Bank of Russia (and counterpart central banks) themselves (which could of course be distorted).",1651845135.0,1651844646.0,t3_ujezt4,t1_i7jw0fc,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Two months after responding to President Volodymyr Zelensky's call, sniper Wali is back in Quebec - unscathed, although he nearly died there ""several times"". But most foreign fighters who have visited Ukraine like him have come away bitterly disappointed, mired in the fog of war without even having been to the front lines once.  
 “I'm lucky to still be alive, it came really close,” says the former soldier of the Royal 22e Régiment, in an interview with La Presse in his home in the greater Montreal area.

  
His last mission in the Donbass region, in a Ukrainian unit that supported conscripted soldiers, somewhat precipitated his return. In the early morning, when he had just taken up position near a trench exposed to the fire of Russian tanks, two of the conscripts came out of their blankets to smoke a cigarette. ""I told them not to expose themselves like that, but they weren't listening to me,"" says Wali. A ""highly accurate"" shell fire from a Russian tank then erupted next to them. The scene described by the maverick is blood-curdling. “It exploded solid. I saw the shrapnel go by like lasers. My body tensed up. I couldn't hear anything, I immediately had a headache. It was really violent.”

  
He immediately understood that there was nothing to be done for his two Ukrainian brothers in arms who had been hit hard. “It smelled of death, it’s hard to describe; it's a macabre smell of charred flesh, sulfur and chemicals. It's so inhuman, that smell.”

  
His wife, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he called her in the middle of the night about an hour later. “He was trying to explain to me that there had been two deaths. He was like, ’I think I've done enough, huh? Have I done enough?‘ Looks like he wanted me to tell him to come back, she says. He was awfully calm.”

  
In the end, it was his family life that won out over his desire to help Ukrainians, says Wali. “My heart feels like going back to the front. I still have the flame. I like the theater of operations. But I pushed my luck. I have no injuries. I say to myself: how far can I roll the dice? I don't want to lose what I have here,” says the young father, who missed his son's first birthday while he was at the front.  


  
After spending two months in Ukraine, Wali draws a ""rather disappointing"" assessment of the deployment of Western volunteer fighters, which began in early March, following a call from President Volodymyr Zelensky. The number of volunteers who showed up – more than 20,000, according to different estimates – was so large that the Ukrainian government had to urgently establish the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine on March 6.  
But for most of the volunteers who showed up at the border, joining a military unit was a hassle.  
Zelensky appealed to all, but in the field the officers were completely helpless. They didn't know what to do with us.

  
He and several other former Canadian soldiers initially preferred to join the Norman Brigade, a private volunteer unit based for several months in Ukraine, led by a former Quebec soldier whose nom de guerre is Hrulf .

  
Dissension quickly set in among the troops and a large number of fighters deserted the Norman Brigade.

  
Three people who requested anonymity described to La Presse promises of arms and protective equipment made by the head of the Norman Brigade which never materialized. Some of the volunteers found themselves about 40 kilometers from the Russian front without any protective equipment. “If there had been a Russian breakthrough, everyone would have been at risk. It was an irresponsible attitude on the part of the Brigade, ”says one of its former soldiers, who asked that his name be withheld for security reasons.  
   
Cheating and impatience  
The commander of the Norman Brigade, who also asked us to withhold his real name for security reasons, confirms that he has been abandoned by around sixty combatants since the beginning of the conflict. Several of them wanted to sign a contract that would have given them status under the Geneva Conventions, as well as guarantees that they would be treated by the Ukrainian state in the event of injury. Hrulf maintains that some even “schemed” to strip him of a $500,000 shipment of arms supplied by Americans, in order to create their own combat unit.  
“There are guys who were in a hurry to go to the front without even having undergone the slightest security check. The Ukrainians tested us, and only now are we starting to get more missions. There's an element of trust that needs to be built, and that's completely normal,” says Hrulf.

  
A ""terrible disappointment""  
""Many volunteer fighters expect it to be turnkey, but war is the opposite, it's a terrible disappointment"", summarizes Wali for his part.  
Along with another Quebec infantryman nicknamed Shadow, the Quebec sniper eventually joined a Ukrainian unit fighting in the Kyiv region.  
   
But then again, finding a gun to fight with was a Kafkaesque exercise. “You had to know someone who knew someone who told you that in this old barbershop, they would give you an AK-47. You had to tinker with a soldier's kit like that by picking up pieces and ammunition left and right, in many cases with weapons in more or less good condition, ”he says.

  
“Even for meals, it is often the civilians who provide them. It is the same for gasoline to move in a vehicle. You constantly have to organize yourself, to know someone who knows someone.”

  
Wali brought back a box of Russian rations, recovered from the rubble of a destroyed vehicle.  
The ex-sniper also reported this 30mm shell fired by a Russian tank.  
     
After a few weeks in Ukrainian territory, some of the most experienced Western soldiers ended up being recruited by the Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate, and would now participate in special operations behind enemy lines, according to one of them. 

  
Others, less experienced, ""jump from one Airbnb to another"" while waiting to be recruited by a unit that will take them to the front, says Wali.

  
The majority, however, have decided to return home, say several people interviewed for this article. ""Many arrive in Ukraine with their chests bulging, but they leave with their tails between their legs,"" says Wali.  
   
In the end, he himself said he only fired two bullets into windows ""to scare"" and never really came within enemy firing range. ""It's a war of machines"", where the ""extremely brave"" Ukrainian soldiers suffer very heavy losses from shelling, but ""miss many opportunities"" to weaken the enemy because they lack technical military knowledge, he summarizes. “If the Ukrainians had the procedures we had in Afghanistan to communicate with the artillery, we could have caused carnage,” he believes.

  
But Wali does not hide his desire to return there despite everything. “You never know when foreign fighters will make a difference on the ground. It's like a fire extinguisher: it's useless until the fire catches.”

Can't blame him, of course. But Ukrainian soldiers can't do that. That's called desertion if you're a soldier, and in wartime you get shot for it.

So who will you truly trust, as a Ukrainian commander? Your own men, or some Westerner fresh off the bus on a return ticket from a Polish airport? Easy answer, right?

Basically, you tell the artillery, ""Hey, I need you to hit this area"", and they basically throw up shells into the vicinity in a pattern.   It doesn't matter whether they're actually targeting a specific point - they're going to rain shells on it.  You don't really spot or check whether what you're doing is actually effective.  That way, you're minimizing the amount of communication and command that's being exercised to correct or change things for more effective results.

The NATO model which they're trying to implement in the Ukrainian army relies on precision over volume.   You have fewer guns, but more levels of targeting and control to make sure you're hitting the right targets at the right time, and coordinating with your troops and reconnaissance/spotters to not waste rounds.  You get better results with fewer guns because you're hitting something with each bracket of shots.

The problem with the precision model is that you need to train up on it - how do you get the information in, process it, and send it out to your artillery pieces.   That takes repetition and lots of drilling.   With the Russians relying on conscripts that are liable to leave as soon as they're able to, and no long-term personnel staying around that isn't an officer, that's near impossible to keep up.

Evgeniy Aleksandrovich Lebedev, pronounced [ɪ̯ɪvˈɡʲenʲɪɪ̯ ˈlʲebʲɪdʲɪf]; born 8 May 1980), is a Russian-British businessman, who owns Lebedev Holdings Ltd, which in turn owns the Evening Standard, The Independent and the TV channel London Live. He derives his wealth from his father, Alexander Lebedev, who is a Russian oligarch and former KGB officer. In July 2020, Lebedev was nominated for a life peerage by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for philanthropy and services to the media, a move that drew criticism.

The E-4 series are specially modified from the Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) program. The E-4 serves as a survivable mobile command post for the National Command Authority, namely the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and successors. The four E-4Bs are operated by the 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron of the 595th Command and Control Group located at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska.

 >A heavy-lift ship is a vessel designed to move very large loads that cannot be handled by normal ships. They are of two types:  Semi-submersible ships that take on water ballast to allow the load—usually another vessel—to be floated over the deck, whereupon the ballast is jettisoned and the ship's deck and cargo raised above the waterline. Project cargo ships that use at least one heavy-lift crane for handling heavy cargo and sufficient ballast to assure stability and sea-keeping properties.

Regulators can (and do) exist, to varying degrees, and control what private media companies say and do.  In the UK, for example, broadcasters are required to show balance: giving equal weight to each side of an issue (this also has problems, such as giving too much weight to fringe lunatics, but it belies the suggestion that private media ownership must entail lack of accountability).  Regulations like this would likely violate the First Amendment in the US however.

Public media ownership can also be quite scary.  I like and support both the BBC and Channel 4 (both publicly owned, for now at least) and find them to be reasonably independent of government interference.  But getting that balance right is *hard*.  Publicly owned media generally turns into government propaganda—and just look at Russia to see what a fucking disaster that can be.

There have been huge survey on twitter with volunteers getting around their cities over Russia and counties Z and V on cars, plus Saint George ribbon. Overall conclusion that on 1500 cars only about 2-3 have anything among above items.

>I’ve been saying that I believe Russians only support this operation out of fear of government more than genuine desire for war.

Not really. We are not revolting and probably won't, because unlike Ukraine that had their revolution in 2014 that they so proud about we do not have opposition parties, deputies, half of military and police on our side and definitely lacking in radical groups ready to take administrative buildings. Not to mention that Russian police buys riot equipment from EU, yeah in all hilarity Russia don't produce batons to beat protesters - they buy it from France and with Belarus they buy flash grenades from Czechia, so they geared good.

Main thing that average non russian should understand is that russians depoliticised population. For 30 years people were told not to participate in electoral process and that government will do shit for them and people turned to their mundane life and trying to make it good with all the circumstances around them. This happened thanks to propaganda and step by step disillusion of Russians with capitalism and democracy. We are like Hungary with Orban and Fidesz or Poland with PiS - liberal side fucked up and can't gather any support so ruling party encroach on democratic process and living on some loaned money be it due to oil and gas prices or whatever. Putin just happened to go mad first.

I honestly think that people just accept main narrative, because it is a cope mechanism, because believe it or not, but main theme of growing up in Russia is ""War is bad and worst shit that can happen ever"". This is legacy of WW2 and that's why there is such a huge fight over not calling current shit show a war. They also believe to a various degree and for various reasons. My grandma can trash government 24/7 over medical equipment and prices, but from time to time spout something like ""well, they haven't won because they ordered not to bomb them"". My father had a real bad life experience with West Ukrainians, so he can spout something like ""i wouldn't mind obliterating Lvov"" at the same time he have a lot of question to the government regarding their economic policies. Both are pretty sane people with actually i would say kind hearts. It's quite bizarre, but understandable.

People in Russia among +40 don't believe that they can change something with electing anyone and that by the end of the day it's all oligarchic rules in other countries, so what's the matter. They are dissatisfied with current events, but they are unwilling to demand changes. They rather will play with government into a game, where government fucking them and they fuck the government and would rather prefer to be left alone by government.

People in Russia among +16-30 are on the other hand too pink glassed about West and democracy. They believe that electing Navalny would change everything, when it's not and the very same thing they don't like in Putin, they neglect in Navalny.

I being 27 y.o. just tired living in a history book. It's like, i just want my country to have at least a 100 year of calm period without any moron dragging us into something be it domestic one or foreign one, but nah.

In many ways the same is true with the response to Russia here.  I bet a lot of the military folks would handle this differently, but they are beholden to the political wonks who (largely) don't understand combat at all beyond their theoretical readings of research papers by think tanks.

And let's also not forget, if we are honest America voluntarily became world police.  America cared more about protecting capitalism than anyone else during the cold war.  The more extreme American version of capitalism was at odds with how most of the world worked.  But for it TO work, it had to become more widespread.  So to.some extent a lot of places have a legitimate beef with American meddling.  I mean Venezuela is a perfect example.  Sure their leadership is a bag of hot donkey droppings, but they really weren't a threat to anyone, certainly not enough to justify what's been done indirectly to their people from sanctions.

So I would say your analogy is correct, but I would change it from what you wrote to: and just like the actual police, sometimes fucked up shit that shouldn't happen does.

Overall the Iraq invasion was a strategic disaster for the US.  It can be argued that Iraq is in a much better place because Saddam is gone (very plausible argument). On the flip side, the Middle East is certainly less stable because of it, and the humanitarian and financial costs were horrific. Now, certainly the US has a much better economic and diplomatic base than Russia so it remains to be seen how much long term effects the war will have on the US. Certainly I can think of much better things to spend several trillion dollars on (infrastructure, education, renewable energy, healthcare) plus thousands of American lives lost.

The E-4 series are specially modified from the Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) program. The E-4 serves as a survivable mobile command post for the National Command Authority, namely the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and successors. The four E-4Bs are operated by the 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron of the 595th Command and Control Group located at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska.

Putin miscalculated the ability of his army to wage a twenty-first-century war with Soviet-era weapons and doctrine and now Russia's military, economy, and government are quite likely to collapse. As for him, Putin's life might be forfeit if they do fall. Top analysts for the State Department, the CIA, and the military say Putin is certainly capable of waging a limited nuclear war in order to achieve some level of victory in this conflict. To pretend he wouldn't do such a thing simply because it makes no sense to you is, itself, nonsensical.

>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said that the assassination attempts against him do not worry him as much as the torture and war crimes being reported in his besieged country.

Weird, sounds like the country is being besieged... and there are assassination attempts. God damn inferior news LYING TO ME. Guess I'll go google around till I find the answer I'm looking for...

>This shows that you are mentally inferior. Ukraine is bigger than most European countries.

Bigger means safer? Then how are they going to ever defeat Russia?

>It is like saying Paris is unsafe because Marseilles is under attack.

It's like that... except it isn't because Marseilles currently doesn't have a 70+ day war besieging them that surrounded the capital not that long ago. It's not like foot soldiers can just sneak around... Or go underground for assassination attempts to some of the worlds most influential people who have been going in and out to drop in and say hi. What are politicians doing there? care to answer? or are the details not important but the impossibilities of your perceived safe places are what keep your theory air tight?

>Do you know where these places are, inferior? Ah, probably not. It is all right-- an inferior does not need to worry about such upsetting things. It needs only worry about following the orders of superiors.

I'm having a hard time following your train of thought. Because you assume I'm not worried whree places are, I'm inferior? Care to enlighten me where Ukraine was during the Soviet Union? I wonder how familiar the Russian military and intelligence might be of Ukraine and sneaking in and out of a country they previously have very detailed records of exactly the topography, and strategic locations are... but you know. I suppose that's all just nuance.

Also what are my order? Go on tell me more about what you don't know. I'm having a blast watching you struggle to stand on your feet, you seem to be throwing blind punches and landing nothing. I feel no sting in your words because they are empty of importance.

Putin seems to be playing a long game here, and a stalemate over territorial gains can easily be sold as a “win” in the “short term” and that’s a year+ at least until Europe stops importing gas. I’m assuming he’s hoping for a lot of current circumstances to change in some way a year+ from now.

It goes bang every time so long as it isn't damaged. However, the real issue with them is their build quality. A large portion of them were built under a communist regime that did not follow the best design like the Finnish M44 does. For that reason, they have very heavy triggers and sloppy bolts. That makes them harder to shoot as fast or as with great accuracy. The Finnish M44 is a great example of what a Mosing 91/30 could be.

For rifles that are better, you should look at the Springfield 1903 (American), the Lee Enfield (UK), Mauser K98 (German), and the Schmidt-Rubin K31(Swiss). All of these are absolutely fantastic rifles. I own all of the above listed rifles. The Mosin is by far the worst of them. The best is a little more of a personal opinion. I feel that my \`\`1903 is the most accurate, the Lee Enfield SMLE No1 MkIV is the fastest to shoot with accuracy, and the K31 has the nicest build feel. The K98 isn't the best at anything in my opinion, but may actually be the best rifle due to it coming second in almost every metric I mentioned about the other three. Others may have different opinions, but I think they are all 4 great rifles. If I could only have one it would be the Springfield 1903, and that is mostly because it has the most accessible ammunition. It uses .30-06 Springfield ammo that new guns are still being chambered in.

Kershaw specifically draws a relation between the German fanatical unwillingness to surrender and Hitler's popular cult of personality, including the factor that the assassination attempt served to galvanize his personality cult throughout the citizens and soldiers of Germany. 

The rapid collapse of occupied France and failures on the Eastern front, as well as the known issues with 'wonder weapons' and even conventional tanks and planes being produced and repaired in insufficient numbers are all linked directly to German logistics and operational failures (just look at how poorly the Luftwaffe maintained its planes as early as the Battle of Britain). I think the parallels I drew above are valid.

What you're saying about Japan is also true, and you're correct about mass surrenders by Germany at the very end of the war, but for the most part the Wehrmacht fought to nearly the bitter end at extraordinary cost of human life and suffering - especially when you consider the war in Europe was essentially decided by mid 1943. An estimated 49 percent of Germany's losses occurred in the last ten months of the war in Europe, when Germany was massively outnumbered and increasingly territorially occupied by the Allies. The Germany regular army was considerably intertwined to the Nazi party by 1944, Goebbels installed partisan representatives throughout the military whose role was strictly to whip up a nationalistic, partisan fervor through the ranks to discourage surrender.",1651868912.0,1651868568.0,t3_ujezt4,t1_i7le0wa,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
