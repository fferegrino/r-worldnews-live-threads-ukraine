>RIGA, Latvia — Soon after the explosion on the Crimean Bridge in October, a 19-year-old Russian student, Olesya Krivtsova, posted an Instagram story criticizing Russia’s war in Ukraine.
>
>Her fellow students at Northern Federal University, in the northern city of Arkhangelsk, took a screenshot of the Instagram story as well as of Krivtsova’s antiwar comments shared in a small chatroom on the Telegram messaging app and reported her to the authorities.
>
>Three months later, Russian officials deemed that sufficient to add Krivtsova to a list of terrorists and extremists, on par with the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and to charge her with discrediting the Russian army under laws adopted last March to stifle public criticism of the war.
>
>The case of Krivtsova, a young student who lives in a remote city near the Arctic Circle, illustrates the depth of intolerance for dissent in wartime Russia, which is targeting not just organized political opposition movements, which have largely been dismantled, but seemingly harmless individuals.
>
>State television has turned the case into a propaganda piece. The Russia 24 channel aired a talk show episode dedicated to Krivtsova, in which Alexander Novikov, the local head of the Communist Party, twice called her “an idiot” and suggested sending her to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine so that she “looks into the eyes” of soldiers and can visit the graves of troops killed in action.
>
>The court proceedings against her are expected to be a show trial, aimed at instilling fear in others who do not support the invasion.

Get some cheap RC plane that can fly quite fast and attach a radar reflector to it so that it gives a signature of a big drone.

Russia will have to shoot it down, which can only result in a pr disaster. You'll have plenty of videos circulating of missiles being launched or flak being fired in the middle of the city. If the drone flies relatively low, you'll also have missile debris raining down on the city which is even worse.

That could damage stuff, make them catch fire, even injure or kill someone.

And the cool thing is that Ukrainian saboteurs could do this all day long. It's super cheap and you don't need much to accomplish this.

> LIPPOLD: I think it's very troubling because what it indicates is just like Iran providing drones that the Russians are using with great effectiveness to attack the critical infrastructure throughout Ukraine, having North Korea now getting engaged in that, what that really is, is **a roundabout way for China to begin supporting Russia with the kind of arms that are killing Ukraine directly**.

And i wanted to share some of my spicy hot takes so get your downvotes ready:

1. Ukraine doesent care if maintanance is more difficult, fuel consumption is to high or the tank is too heavy. They will take every tank they can get.

2. Best example for this is them accepting the 12 challanger 2's wich lets be honest is a token force and all the supply issues that come with only having 12 of them. 

3. Abrahms tanks is a capable and usefull platform for Ukraine and anyone who argues about the supply chain seems to be all to willing to ignore the same argument when germany made it.

4. All the media bashing on germany has cleary gotten completely out of hand and is being fueled by mostly polish british and american media as well as international media that understandibly want more support for ukraine writing in a way that will archive this(also includes local german media).

5. All of this has evolved into a dynamic of its own with very harsh criticism and sometimes borderline racist and derogatory of all of the german people. The Last part is obviously the polish influence by PIS asociated media. 

6.German Arms industry while not small ( with facilitys all over europe not just in germany) is not capable of handeling the incredible increase in demand caused by the combination of almost all western european nations awakening from a deep slumber of defense spending cuts over the last decades and the sudden realisation that an army actually has a use. (here again only germany gets called out) Aswell as the new requirements for Ukraine. A lot of investment will be necessary but new facillitys will take time to construct even in an accalerated Form.

7. The US and especially the military industrial complex seeks to take andvantage of this by encourageing nations to switch to American models and sending all their german and other arms to ukraine. And analysts and think tanks we all pationately follow are aware of this and encourage this behaviour.

8.This is not only about money but also about influence since america has been seeking to get involved into the europen market for a long time but has been dominated by europen arms makers. Reliance on American arms also increases dependancy on the USA 

9.Poland has deliberately made a public spectacle out of the export allowance by anouncing its interest to export leopards out of nowhere ( not because UA didnt ask for them but because they did not talk this through with their partners) and at the same time not making a formal request until friday while making it THE public talking point until now. Public offices dont work on the weekend and will take some days to process this order. 

10.poland will spend all this time making a public spectacle out of the whole ordeal to make it seem like germany bent to their pressure. Because thats what gets PIS votes.

11. The decission to send Leopard 2's has alredy been made or at least the intention to do so has been. My Reasoning for this is the claim that non publicly disclosed agreements have been made, aswell as the go ahead to start with the training of UA soldiers on the system.

12.Since providing Leopards to Ukraine has to be a multination effort and polands populist speerhead move wich left many unprepared (no not only germany even though thats the only one where it is publicly scrutiniesed) inquieries and assesments habe to be made to coordinate such an endevor. Some might as well have to gather the necessary political support for this.

13. This is very important to me so listen up: Germany is not pro russia, Germany is not a lacluster ally, Germany does not seek nonexisting Trade relations with russia after the war. And germany is most certainly not holding back on its support for ukraine for whatever reason. Germany is moving at an unprecedanted speed and determination to make all of its support possible. This might not seem like it to you where you come from but the last year was a tectonic change for german soceiety.

Basically, how I read this is we need to take what Germany says at face value as they have shown that they will downplay what they are doing instead of making bold rhetorical stands.

One key thing that makes me think this is really a non-issue is that UA troops have begun training on the leopard system. That would not be happening if there were no plans at all to give them to UA. Maybe the date of transfer is not finalized or what have you, but personally I believe it will happen. Germany most likely sees no reason to transfer the tanks at this moment but I would not be surprised if once training has happened to a sufficient degree, suddenly leopards appear in UA.",False,1674415728.0,t3_10iahp0,t3_10iahp0,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Europe’s central power is also uniquely qualified to shape a larger European response designed to end Vladimir Putin’s criminal war of terror in a way that deters future aggression around places such as Taiwan.
>
>Germany’s historical responsibility comes in three unequal stages. Eighty years ago, Nazi Germany was itself fighting a war of terror on this very same Ukrainian soil: the same cities, towns and villages were its victims as are now Russia’s, and sometimes even the same people.
>
>Boris Romanchenko, for example, a survivor of four Nazi concentration camps, was killed by a Russian missile in Kharkiv. No historical comparison is exact, but Putin’s attempt to destroy the independent existence of a neighbouring nation, with war crimes, genocidal actions and relentless targeting of the civilian population, is the closest we have come in Europe since 1945 to what Adolf Hitler did in the second world war.
>
>The lesson to learn from that history is not that German tanks should never be used against Russia, whatever the Kremlin does, but that they should be used to protect Ukrainians, who were among the greatest victims of both Hitler and Stalin.
>
>The second stage of historical responsibility comes from what the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has honestly described as the “bitter failure” of German policy towards Russia after the annexation of Crimea and the start of Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014. That policy could accurately be characterised as appeasement. Fatefully, far from reducing its energy dependence on Russia, Germany further increased it after 2014, to more than 50% of its total gas imports, as well as building the never-used Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
>
>This historic mistake led to the third and most recent stage. A month after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February last year, a group of leading German figures formulated an appeal for an immediate boycott of fossil fuels from Russia. “Looking back on its history,” they wrote, “Germany has repeatedly vowed that there must ‘never again’ be wars of conquest and crimes against humanity. Today the hour has come to honour that vow.”
>
>Chancellor Olaf Scholz decided against this radical course, arguing that it would endanger “hundreds of thousands of jobs” and plunge both Germany and Europe into recession. Instead, the country made hugely impressive efforts, led by the Green economy minister Robert Habeck, to wean itself off Russian energy.
>
>This has also become a litmus test of Germany’s courage to resist Putin’s nuclear blackmail, overcome its own domestic cocktail of fears and doubts, and defend a free and sovereign Ukraine. Scholz’s speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday gave no hint of such boldness. But in stepping to the front of a European Leopard plan for Ukraine, Scholz would be showing German leadership that the entire west would welcome. He would also be learning the right lessons from Germany’s recent and very recent history.

>Ukraine’s human and material losses during World War II were enormous. Some 5 to 7 million people perished. Even with the return of evacuees from the east and the repatriation of forced labourers from Germany, Ukraine’s estimated population of 36 million in 1947 was almost 5 million less than before the war. Because more than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages had been destroyed, 10 million people were left homeless. Only 20 percent of the industrial enterprises and 15 percent of agricultural equipment and machinery remained intact, and the transportation network was severely damaged. The material losses constituted an estimated 40 percent of Ukraine’s national wealth.

Sometimes you have to act enthusiastic even though you aren’t really. And sometimes you have to act reluctant even though you really do want to do some thing.

The story does matter. I think that we saw a very similar dynamic play out with the US entry in to the European theater in WWII. Sometimes people, or governments, want to have their arms twisted.

So let us not sow division that Russia wants at the very least, but acknowledge we're contributing to one and the same cause here, ideally -- Russian defeat.

>  
>*Claimed gains come as Germany and France’s leaders meet in Paris to discuss Ukraine aid*  
>  
>Moscow said its forces advanced in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region as Kyiv’s Western allies continued pressuring Berlin to allow deliveries of German-made tanks to Ukraine.  
>  
>Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that Russian troops had advanced in the partially occupied region and taken more advantageous lines and positions. The ministry’s spokesman, Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, didn’t provide further details.  
>  
>It was the second time in two days that Moscow has said its forces were advancing in the south of Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin claimed the region as part of Russia’s territory in September despite continued fighting, and its defense is a priority for the Kremlin.  
>  
>As in the eastern Donetsk region, which Mr. Putin has also claimed and where Moscow says it has taken several towns in recent weeks, Ukrainian officials said there was fighting in the Zaporizhzhia region but didn’t say any territory had been lost.  
>  
>The claimed advances come as Russia has shown signs of turning the tide in the war after a string of losses in the early fall. Mr. Putin’s mobilization drive of 300,000 reservists along with the recruitment of inmates from across Russia’s vast prison system into the Wagner paramilitary group, whose forces now total about 50,000 in Ukraine, have shifted the war of attrition in Moscow’s favor.   
>  
>The Russian claims add urgency to Ukraine’s pleas for more heavy weaponry from the West, particularly modern battle tanks.

Boris was pictured in an airport in 2018 stumbling home having jettisoned his security detail for the entire night against advice, to stay at Evgeny Lebedev's castle in Italy. Something he was later forced to admit.

MPs are also investigating Johnson’s 2020 award of a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev since allegations emerged that it was granted despite an assessment that it posed a national security risk.

> I was asked an interesting question:

> ""What is the main reason why you think that a significant success of Russian troops in an offensive is currently impossible?""

> Here's my answer:


> Of the whole set of reasons that very seriously weaken the combat capability of the RF Armed Forces (not only on the offensive, but also on the defensive), I still believe the main one to be the moral factor. Most mobilized (and most regular) servicemen in the Russian Armed Forces have no motivation to make sacrifices in combat against the AFU, because the objectives of the war are not only not clearly communicated by the government, but not even officially stated. At the same time, the disciplinary measures available to the RF Armed Forces' command ""under peacetime laws"" are insufficient to make servicemen fear them more than death and injury from enemy fire.
Accordingly, in such circumstances the following units have a chance of success in an offensive:

> \- Volunteer units (of which there cannot be many);

> \- Wagner mercenary units, which have their own ""internal ideology"" (typical of the Landsknecht) combined with the most brutal repressive discipline, which goes beyond even the wartime legislation of the Soviet era.

> Hence the conclusion: a full-fledged offensive against a stubborn enemy position with ""elite"" units can only be conducted by the military command in very limited and isolated areas. (For example - the direction to Soledar-Bahmut), where it is possible to conduct combat operations without involving forces other than the ""Death's Head stormtroopers"". (If you do not like this definition, please refer to the Wagner insignia).

> In all other sectors, a successful offensive is also (theoretically) possible, but only if one can achieve a numerical and (most importantly) mechanical superiority over the enemy, thus making it possible to suppress their will to resist, and to create in one's own troops a perception of their overwhelming superiority. However, when confronted with the most resilient and professional units of the enemy, even a large superiority is no guarantee of a major success.

> But what do we have? In general we have got ""parity"" in the number of troops (as a result of the autumn ""half-assed mobilisation"") and some advantage in some types of heavy equipment and artillery, but with an extreme lack of decent means of reconnaissance and communication (in which the enemy has a considerable advantage over our troops on the whole).

> That is why I believe that if our troops undertake a large-scale offensive on one or several sections of the front - if we combine insufficient numbers with low morale and a very weak disciplinary apparatus (not considering the ""quality"" of command in particular) - only an even worse condition of the enemy troops can save us from defeat. Faced with persistent and able enemy resistance, such an offensive will inevitably fade because of the command's inability to compel its forces to go into battle with the necessary degree of military valor. This, in turn, may allow the enemy (if they are able to retain sufficient reserves) to launch counterattacks and achieve success. Perhaps even of an operational and strategic nature.

> What should be done to change the situation? - I have spoken and written about that probably a 100 times already... since last March. Practically nothing has been done or is planned by the highest military and political authorities of the Russian Federation. Because the hope ""for an agreement with partners"" persists and ""the rat does not feel cornered"" (because it is delusional and is unable to objectively assess reality).",1674392687.0,1674392459.0,t3_10iahp0,t1_j5ehauc,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

And about the fact that Poland didnt  submit a re-export request, well yeah thats true but thats not suprising in media in Poland they were clear that they didnt do it yet because Poland's position is very clear from the beginning, very similar to Germany position: Poland will NOT go by itself, it will ONLY give leopards 2 to Ukraine as part of coalition, Poland like Germany doesnt want to paint target on only itself.
so what it means for re-export request ? well it means that Poland want to submit the request JOINTLY with other countries as part of coalition, why wont it just sumbit request now and other countries to do it later ? well IF request is accepted than there will be international pressure to give the tanks to Ukraine, what if at that time other countries who said they would also send decided to back out, in that situation it would paint huge target on Poland.

Only safe way to do this is to do this as group.

>After the Marder announcement at the start of the year, a frustrated Polish government decided they had to pledge something fenomanal aswell.

And on top of that:

>However, Germany was gladly prepared to allow Poland a delivery of the Leopards. Vice Chancellor Habeck, the responsible minister, was open to the idea. He immediately said the Polish government could make an export-request which his department would rubberstamp.

I challenge any German here to provide a quote from Habeck saying this.  Go for it.  Because the screen shot of the article in German does not say that - this is blatantly an attempt to mislead non-German readers into thinking it says something it doesn't.  Just like all the Germans who have been running around here claiming that Germany already said they would allow the transfer of Leopards by other countries, but nobody had asked yet so everyone else is lying - provide an actual official source saying that Germany would allow it.  

Everything after that is just BS without anything to back it up, like this:

> Morawiecki realized he had been to hastily with his announcement. Among European countries owning Leopards, there was no wide spread support for Leopard delivery.

And this:

> It was after the 11th of January, when media, twitter and a set of hostile think tanks started to develop a narrative in which they put all blamee on Germany.

>Ukraine doesent care if maintanance is more difficult, fuel consumption is to high or the tank is too heavy. They will take every tank they can get.Best example for this is them accepting the 12 challanger 2's wich lets be honest is a token force and all the supply issues that come with only having 12 of them.

Challenger is your proof? Ukraine accepted fucking T-55

>All the media bashing on germany has cleary gotten completely out of hand and is being fueled by mostly polish british and american media as well as international media that understandibly want more support for ukraine writing in a way that will archive this(also includes local german media).

Leopard is only European tank which can be delivered. People are dissapointed in Germany, so them not sending L2 YET wouldn't be too big issue. Bigger issue is fact that Germany is scared to send L2 which cost them 0

>All of this has evolved into a dynamic of its own with very harsh criticism and sometimes borderline racist and derogatory of all of the german people. The Last part is obviously the polish influence by PIS asociated media.

No PiS associated media. Central and Eastern Europe just want Russia to finally lose. If you belives this is only propaganda, then it's very sad interpretation

>6.German Arms industry while not small ( with facilitys all over europe not just in germany) is not capable of handeling the incredible increase in demand caused by the combination of almost all western european nations awakening from a deep slumber of defense spending cuts over the last decades and the sudden realisation that an army actually has a use. (here again only germany gets called out) Aswell as the new requirements for Ukraine. A lot of investment will be necessary but new facillitys will take time to construct even in an accalerated Form.

And this stop Germany from sending equipment in which way? Russia will suddenly invade Germany? Because most logical path would be trought Poland and Poland delivered a ton of shit

>7. The US and especially the military industrial complex seeks to take andvantage of this by encourageing nations to switch to American models and sending all their german and other arms to ukraine. And analysts and think tanks we all pationately follow are aware of this and encourage this behaviour.

Well Germany by angering whole Europe for sure is helping USA in this endavour. If Germany would be swift to act, then people wouldn't be upset and Germany would be the one to earn a lot of respect

>8.This is not only about money but also about influence since america has been seeking to get involved into the europen market for a long time but has been dominated by europen arms makers. Reliance on American arms also increases dependancy on the USA

I'm not sure about that. In case of South Korea, then true. But in case of USA? 

>9.Poland has deliberately made a public spectacle out of the export allowance by anouncing its interest to export leopards out of nowhere ( not because UA didnt ask for them but because they did not talk this through with their partners) and at the same time not making a formal request until friday while making it THE public talking point until now. Public offices dont work on the weekend and will take some days to process this order.

This is bs take. Coalition being created was seen for at least one week already. I can't belive that Germany was surprised by it. Plus on formal request you can't answer ""idk, wait""

>10.poland will spend all this time making a public spectacle out of the whole ordeal to make it seem like germany bent to their pressure. Because thats what gets PIS votes.

It change nothing in Polish political landscape. Every politician and most of citizens are happy with helping Ukraine in this war

>11. The decission to send Leopard 2's has alredy been made or at least the intention to do so has been. My Reasoning for this is the claim that non publicly disclosed agreements have been made, aswell as the go ahead to start with the training of UA soldiers on the system.

Problem is time yet again. Even UA diplomats say already that Berlin will allow Leopards (even vice-chancellor was saying so, interesting that they changed opinion). Germany just want to wait as long as possible to deliver anything - i.e. Patriots. They can't send them, but later USA said they will deliver them and Germany suddenly have Patriots which stupid Ukrainians can operate

>12.Since providing Leopards to Ukraine has to be a multination effort and polands populist speerhead move wich left many unprepared (no not only germany even though thats the only one where it is publicly scrutiniesed) inquieries and assesments habe to be made to coordinate such an endevor. Some might as well have to gather the necessary political support for this.

I don't believe that at least 4 countries owning Leopards hasn't give green light for this idea. Like Finland responded the same day

>13. This is very important to me so listen up: Germany is not pro russia, Germany is not a lacluster ally, Germany does not seek nonexisting Trade relations with russia after the war. And germany is most certainly not holding back on its support for ukraine for whatever reason. Germany is moving at an unprecedanted speed and determination to make all of its support possible. This might not seem like it to you where you come from but the last year was a tectonic change for german soceiety.

And it still seems like far away from enough. How much longer? Now imagine Russia invade Lithuanian - in this case Germany also would say ""screw you guys""?

Therefore, it's useful to explore the issue through an economic lens.

First off, all planning has to consider that Russia never ""loses"" a war, they just stop fighting until the next time, and keep whatever territory they gained in the process.  There will be a next time.  And there is always an outside chance that Russia prevails.  That means Europe must maintain and possibly increase military posture.

Second, NATO from back in Cold War days has carved up responsibilities:  Germany supplied Europe with Leo as a first line of defense, purpose-built for the terrain, logistics and combat strategies of Russia.  Abrams is there as sheer weight of numbers (as well as being impressive in its own right).   Logically, Leo is the tank to send to Ukraine, since Ukraine has adopted the position of ""first line"".

But Leo inventory is distributed, and is not maintained in numbers.  They can't be manufactured in numbers either.  So whatever goes to Ukraine has to come from inventory.  And, by principle #1, that inventory needs replacement, and the number Ukraine needs (and will inevitably be lost in combat) can't be replaced by manufacturing.   So whether Leo is sent or not, replacement has to be Abrams.

Tanks aren't the kind of thing you click onto a map with a mouse to win a battle and then that's the end of it. They are long-lasting assets.      
 
Germany risks losing markets if nations contribute from Leo inventory backfilled with Abrams. It does not risk losing markets if Abrams is contributed directly, because Ukraine is a market it does not yet have.   

This means, for German MI complex, it is vastly preferable in the short- and long- term to ship Abrams directly to Ukraine.  Which also means impeding the transfer of Leo to Ukraine.  

For US MI complex, it seems Abrams will ship one way or another.  However, it is better to (a) equip Ukraine with the best tank for the job up front, and (b) as a side-effect gain significant foothold in markets that Germany has held.   So US interests are against supply of Abrams, until supply of Leo has at least started. 

This explains Germany's position of ""we will if you will"", US posture on delay of Abrams as long as possible, and Ukraine's desire for Leopards  (while demanding Abrams). 

Ultimately, in the end, like Patriot, I suspect we will see Abrams in Ukraine.  And Leo. 

Because while Russia doesn't ""lose"" wars, their military does tend to take matters into its own hands and sideline the country for a few decades if humiliated on the battlefield.  Therefore, the best strategy for Ukraine and the west is to curb-stomp Russia in Ukraine.

It is the US military. It is really hard to explain just how big of a difference the US military is compared to every other military in the world. When the US went into Iraq they built small cities as bases all over the country. It is needed for what the equipment requires.

The Abrams runs on jet fuel, even though it can run on basically anything the lower quality fuels give lower mpg. Even on jet fuel the Abrams gets .52 mpg on roads and .24 mpg off road. A lot of the fighting in Ukraine is taking place in fields. Now try to imagine what it takes to keep 20 Abrams fueled up and supplied with ammo. Even at .24 mpg you would be looking at needing to fuel them up every two days. They burn a lot even while idle. That would be 10 thousand gallons of jet fuel every two days. Remember, it would be more than that since they would be using diesel.

Most military fuel trucks are 2,500 gallons so you need 4 of those running constantly just for the tanks in that one group. That doesn't include the security those trucks need. That doesn't include the ammo that they need.

Then t he maintenance which they will not be trained on, it might happen over time but if you want them to get the Abrams soon there just isn't enough time. Even something like a fuel filter is important. Think about a diesel truck, needs to change it every 10,000 miles? Well you are running at 30 mpg so the fuel filter needs to be swapped out every 333 gallons. The tank will chew through that in days. The maintenance that is required is massive. Again, 9 support for every one fighter. 

Should we get into how complicated the Abrams tank is? Did you know that if one Abrams sees a target that every other Abrams in the area can see it on their hud? Even behind hills and tree lines, like a fking video game. The Abrams is seriously complicated. The AIT for an Abrams maintenance tech is half a year, that is just AIT. An example of how complicated it is would be the HIMARS training takes 1 month. The HIMARS team is trained to do everything in those 4 weeks, maintenance and operation. They also have to be trained to drive the big ass truck. The training time to do maintenance on an Abrams? 6 months.",1674424649.0,1674424425.0,t3_10iahp0,t1_j5gi7ei,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

This is about Germany choosing to stop mass production of tanks and now fearing they will lose their export market ….because they chose to stop mass producing tanks.

The American proposal is a sound one. Europe gets Abrams now and, more importantly, Ukraine gets leopards now. Germany knows this.

Once again, Germany is showing it cares more about its export market than helping Ukraine.

To put it simply, Germany wants its cake and to eat it. The want to not have to spend money on building tanks and keep their export market.

The false narrative here is that Germany is somehow a “scape goat” and was never really dithering about Ukraine.

Dithering is exactly what Germany was doing and continues to do - why? Because it’s all about keeping their Leopard export market.

Once again, Germany displays it priorities, and cries about it being “a scapegoat” when they are called out on it.

Ukraine needs tanks now. The Americans have a valid solution. It should be done.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire

In 1902-3 the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was published in Russia to further fuel and attempt to justify anti-Semitism and attacks against the Jewish population.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion

Whilst it was based on earlier conspiracies and anti Jewish propaganda this rehashing of it also served the Nazis and was further adapted and disseminated by them to fuel their anti-Semitic campaign, despite leadership knowing the document was fake.

Part of the rhetoric was that it was necessary to kill the Jews and seize power because the Jews were planning to dominate the world and elliminate gentiles. Some of those doing the killing lamented the bloody task but considered that it was necessary as an 'us or them' situation, such was the degree to which they had swallowed the propaganda.

Similar stories are heard now with the intercepted phonecalls between Russian soldiers and their wives. I've heard several where they lament the killing but believe it is necessary to stop the Ukrainians doing the same to them, along with the same kind of 'Untermensch' dehumanisation of the holocaust. 'They're not people anymore' was something one of the soldiers wives said in one.

Now that Russia is trying to push the holy war angle to justify their insane actions it doesn't really seem surprising to see the Jews dragged into things again for no reason.

WWII was so brutal and horrible for everyone involved a lot of countries that didn't get along still thought that this was a good idea. It might not always work, but the idea was that anything is better than war so it was worth trying. 

This is why the Soviet Union was on the security council. Not despite of being, but *because* they were a belligerent power player. The people who might be attacking or defending in the next global war got the prime seating. 

Using this logic, the spirit of the original UN charter says that's exactly why Russia should sit on the security council. It sucks because they're awful, but the idea is maybe we can talk this out without wholesale killing. 

The problem is that people really want the UN to be something it was never made to do. It has power, but only those powers the member states decide to give it. It can't be a police force unless everyone says it's ok, and they won't shoot the guys in the baby-blue helmets. 

If we were to kick the Russians out of the UN then the UN would become another NATO to them: russophobic Nazis ganging up on brave and plucky Russia because they are too weak to face their obvious übermenche superiors, who are also just peace-loving victims.

There is no reaonable comparison. In fact Ukraine shares more similarities with wartime USSR than Russia does in terms of material support from allies, shere amount of allies, access to intelligence and access to tech production. The only point where Russia is closer to the USSR is in some degree in weapon stores (but that is being rapidly backfilled by the West in Ukraine's case, and the Russian stores are outdated), and in manpower, because they have *more* potential manpower at the outset of conflict than Ukraine had.

>When Lloyd Austin urges the German government to approve the delivery of Leopard 2s to Ukraine, he also has American interests in mind. In doing so, he plunges the Germans and Chancellor Scholz into a dilemma. If Scholz gives in, he harms German interests. If he stands firm, he risks Ukraine losing more territory and thus also harms German interests. How this tricky situation could come about has to do with German security policy over the past thirty years.

>In Germany, however, arms exports have not been considered from this point of view for decades, but rather from an economic and above all an ethical point of view. Politicians, especially from the left-wing spectrum, wanted Germany to stop exporting weapons abroad altogether. They were convinced that this would make the world more peaceful.  
>  
>The Americans are pursuing a different policy, and increasingly ruthlessly, even towards their own allies. France felt this two years ago when Australia unceremoniously cancelled a contract to build submarines worth 56 billion euros in order to buy American boats. Previously, the US government had concluded a security alliance with the Australian government and Great Britain that assured the Australians of the United States' assistance. In return, the Australians were to buy their weapons in the USA.

Additionally, with more and more former Soviet countries flourishing from turning to the West l, Putin's Russia can't afford to let Ukraine also join the West, flourish and have more Russians realise the Western system is better for the masses.

It’s not the 1980s anymore, though, and I now believe countries whose populations are, to an extent, isolated, and whose populations receive most of their news from ‘government approved’ sources are virtually immune to democratizing aspects of globalization & free trade.  
  
The extreme example of that of course being North Korea — even if trade opened up with that country, their population is all unfortunately so brainwashed in believing in their supreme leader that there is no way they are ready to behave as adults on the global stage.

After the collapse of his business he went into politics and had some fairly anti-establishment and anti US views. I suspect that the collapse of his business and subsequent debts have significantly influence his current political views. Once he got into the European Parliament, he aligned with the radical left that basically view the US/West as virulently evil capitalists and has spoken out numerous times in support of China, Russia, Iran, etc. Basically a major tankie. Next election isn’t until 2024 - his group Independents 4 Change won 7.4% of the vote and were awarded two seats in 2019.

JP-8 is designed to be used as a sort of omni-fuel - as well as planes and tanks, it is also used as a diesel replacement for many ground vehicles, for generators, for heaters and cookers, and as a coolant - having 1 fuel vs 3 or 4 makes logistical supply chains massively easier, and modern warfare is all about the logistics.

I do not believe that multi-million procurement contracts are that much of a moral issue for the buying nations.

Price, how well the offer fits the tender, capacity to deliver in time and train personal, reliability to support for a long time, compatibility to existing equipment & that of the allies and of course foreign and domestic policies; these factors matter way more than morality. At least that is my believe, we are all speculating here. 

Yes, I can see why for example the Netherlands could hypothetically not buy arms from Russia because they downed MH-17, but that is a way bigger moral issue for the people of the buying nation than the uncertainty of maybe not being able to re-export the equipment in the way they want. An uncertainty that is also there if you buy from a competitor because they also write contracts that limit re-export, only slightly less uncertain because there may not be negative precedence like in Germany's case. 

>This is not the first time Germany has blocked or delayed weapons when it's clear it is the wrong decision to do so.

I think Germany has a pretty ok-ish track record when it comes to deliveries for legally binding records and I think that matters most to the buying governments. And whether ""it's clear it is the wrong decision to do so"" depends on the perspective. The states Germany sells weapons to are very diverse and states like Egypt, Turkey or Saudi Arabia hold slightly to very different values to the both of us.

The basic strategies behind the lying are fairly predictable: Russia has hyper-capitalist sympathizers in the German government, or perhaps dirt or other leverage, so is working the information space to magnify the disagreements, to slow action. Seems pretty clear, that's a stock tactic of theirs. They aren't talking about F-16s. Odd that, but not that odd, because they still don't dominate the skies and don't want to bring attention to that ugly fact. A few weak points about Ukraine attacking Russian Air Bases, but not too much because it means Russian Air Defense is shit. 

So what you can do is pay attention to the *types* of propaganda they are generating, or not. Seriously, though, what they say is designed to provoke and mislead you so don't get sucked into *caring* about what they say. Part of running multiple, contradictory stories at the same time is dismantling the idea that there is a truth out there that can be accurately reported. So confusing you is part of the game. 

I take the infighting between the various military factions in Russia to be big news, because all of the players are big enough to have their own propaganda machines: Putin, Prigozhin and Shiugu all have their private armies in addition to the RF army, and they all fight over the supplies, and sometimes shoot each other. This works for Putin as no one side can get powerful enough to stage a coup, but on the other hand infighting leaves less to fight against Ukraine. And they steal from each other too, which is nice. But you need to dig a bit to find that information. It's allowed out because the players are powerful but the state doesn't want it reported if they can do anything about it. 

But to your question: the uptick you're seeing in because Russia thinks they can drive a wedge into the coalition and prevent useful aide from getting sent. They act because they think it will help them. Paradoxically, the increase of chatter usually telegraphs weakness, in that they feel they need to act. But it can also mean there is an active rift that should be exploited, because that's what using information as a weapon means. These events are usually pretty clear though. They are working the Germany thing hard, and anyone can see that.

1) Trump putting a tariff on Canadian aluminium was just an example (of many, including those you noted) I was giving on how his foreign policy harmed NATO to show how viewing his administration as a threat was not unreasonable. 

2) The 2% rule is honestly kind of silly when you look at how much money NATO spends overall, and especially in hindsight with how weak our external threats are. NATO already makes up about 57% of the world's military budget (granted the US makes up about 2/3s of that), and for an ostensibly defensive alliance, it's a huge amount of overkill.

The main difference is that the Abrams doesn’t use a traditional engine and instead has a jet turbine engine which is a vastly more complicated bit of kit. Ukrainian mechanics can most likely learn the ins and outs of maintaining leopard 2’s or challenger 2’s quite quickly as they use more traditional tank engines, but getting trained up and having the facilities in place to just run the abrams isn’t practical.

Kinda. I think there's a big difference between banning the import and having a tariff. But otherwise probably not too much. I think I get a but annoyed at this sub for trying to ascribe some of Europe's mistakes to Trump. As an American who didn't vote for Trump, I'm fine with taking some blame for his mistakes but I personally think Merkel really fucked up dealing with Russia and get annoyed it doesn't get acknowledged more.

>I was giving on how his foreign policy harmed NATO to show how viewing his administration as a threat was not unreasonable. 

Tariffs against another NATO country harms NATO? That's... Not usually a thing. Every country has the right to protect their economic interests and that's separate from NATO, a purely defensive alliance. Canada has pretty substantial milk product tariffs that were murdering the diary industry in Wisconsin and New York a few years back, before the steel tariff. Canada has always defended those tariffs. So I don't really accept that Canadian tariffs were really a security threat to NATO, especially since every country had them. 

>The 2% rule is honestly kind of silly when you look at how much money NATO spends overall, and especially in hindsight with how weak our external threats are. NATO already makes up about 57% of the world's military budget (granted the US makes up about 2/3s of that), and for an ostensibly defensive alliance, it's a huge amount of overkill. Personally, I'm OK with my country spending less money funding the military industrial complex and more on domestic priorities, but it is a fair point that we should try to honour our treaty obligations.

I think the point of asking European nations, particularly economically stable ones like Germany, to contribute more was so the US didn't have to invest so much in Europe and could focus more on China. As you said, the US is disproportionately contributing to NATO and frankly Europe was kind of taking advantage of that; essentially outsourcing a lot of their defense spending to the US. I'd also add it's not silly to expect NATO's military spending to be huge relative to the rest of the world; that's sort of the point. Attacking a NATO country is supposed to be an overwhelmingly suicidal idea so it hopefully never happens.

I agree in principle that I'd rather have less in the MIC and more on policies that... You know aren't focused on killing. But the reality is I would rather have assholes like Russia be too afraid to attack my country. If people weren't dicks we could all have nicer things.

>The freedom fries thing was a response to the OP complaining about French criticism. My point was that the vitriol between the US and France goes both ways. 

I mean, is freedom fries really vitriol? Nobody took that seriously. But yeah I agree with your larger point.

>I don't disagree with you on Merkel's foreign policy, although it should be noted that sometimes criticism is easier in hindsight.

Well sure. But I think an important part of learning is acknowledging what was a fuck up. Democracy beats autocracy when we're more held to the truth than the politics, so admitting when people we like were wrong or people we don't like were right is key. And she played Russia almost completely wrong. 

>We can only hope to make the best decision with the information we have at the time. 

Sure, although that doesn't mean well intention mistakes aren't still mistakes. 

>On Merkel's end, i can see how her policy, pragmatically, came from reluctance to harm the German economy when technically there was no state of war between NATO and Russia. As a politician, she was answerable to her electorate, and in her shoes, I probably would have done the same thing at the time

I think her ignorance could be justified until Crimea (although Baltics and other eastern bloc countries were never in favor of getting close to Russia). She now states that was when she started distrusting Putin (since he blatantly lied to her), but the facts show she still continued with Nord Stream 2, still dragged her feet on defense spending, and still fought with Trump on those issues when he said Russia shouldn't be trusted, something she should have known already.

The first request should have been the Patriot system that Germany (and later the Netherlands) want to transfer – which was only allowed after the US decided to deliver it themselves. In last summer there was no request of Spain for Leopard 2 after it ""discovered"" how bad in shape its tanks are so here we have likely a PR coup that should conceal that Spain hasn't given many arms to Ukraine. You have to consider that Spain a few days ago officially excluded giving tanks to Ukraine so the reported issue seems to exist. This decision will make it really hard to send even 100 Leopard 2 if Germany allows it because no one will want to send the newest models and most of the older ones are in nations that won't export them (Turkey/Greece/Switzerland/Spain).

All else Germany only blocked for itself but not for other nations. We now know that there were sometimes reasons for this like the ammunition issue with the Gepard. And besides the first two months of the war it wasn't the only country that blocked certain things – next to no one else delivered them. Likely because of its past Germany doesn't want to go solo in such things.

And yes you need trust for a weapon business but the trust here wasn't broken for things that really matter with weapon deals. No to mention that there is likely already an inofficial deal in place which is known by people that buy weapons (but not by the people that write opinion articles) or why else should anyone train Ukrainians on Leopard 2 at the moment?

This is where you briefly touch on a moral aspect, but again roll back to the legal argument of talking about re-export.

Germany has damaged its reputation and the perception of it being unreliable is now out there. Put aside whether you view something as technically reliable or whether something is a ""top 3 worldwide weapons exporter"" and approach it from another nation.

Finland did not lie, what does this have to do with it? Of course they want to send them and need a reexport license (just like with any other arms reexport). They have stated their intend running up to the last Ramstein meeting ([Source from 13.01.2023](https://www.dw.com/de/ukraine-aktuell-finnland-denkt-%C3%BCber-lieferung-von-leopard-2-panzern-nach/a-64374218)).

Reuters reported an undisclosed German government spokesperson leaking that there have not been any formal requests for reexporting Leopard 2s. ([Source Reuters, via Kyiv Independent from 13.01.2023](https://kyivindependent.com/news-feed/reuters-germany-says-it-didnt-receive-leopard-tanks-request-from-poland-finland)).

And Ben Wallace probably also didn't lie when he talked about a formal request by an undisclosed country. ([Source on Ben Wallace mentioning a formal request from  20.01.2023](https://news.sky.com/story/berlin-asked-for-permission-to-send-german-made-leopard-2-tanks-to-ukraine-ben-wallace-reveals-12790563))

This is what US SecDef Lloyd Austin had to say after Ramstein:

>'He told reporters other countries were providing tanks to Ukraine: ""I don't have any announcements to make on M1s \[Abrams tanks\] and you heard the German minister of defence say that they've not made a decision on Leopards.""  
>  
>[Source, Interview was on 20.01.2023](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64350877)

So taking from this, I'd expect a formal request to have been issued around the Ramstein meeting on 20.01.2023. Which has not yet been denied or approved of, just as SecDef Pistorius of Germany announced at Ramstein as well.

Well, this is what we are discussing here. We are discussing whether the perception of Germany blocking the re-export to Ukraine leads to a significant lesser volume of arms sales in the future. You believe that, I don't.

Almost my whole reply was about how much of a factor I think the question of morality is. Me using the words ""contract"" or ""re-export"" does not invalidate my point.

>You seem to think ""reliability"" means the technical reliability of a thing versus the perceived reliability of a nations government to do the right thing.

No I don't, and I don't know what makes you feel that way. I specifically mentioned the ""perceived reliability as a partner"" from your source.

>""top 3 worldwide weapons exporter""

This is a misquote, I wrote ""top 3 worldwide"" in the same sentence as ""perceived reliability as a partner"". Germany is, by the survey in your 2nd source, still in the top 3 in the category *perceived reliability as a partner.* And that is after the drop and within 1% of the first place.

>If they're perceived as bad, or unreliable that'll be the perception and  
it will impact how others deal with that person. That is the reality.

Yes, but Germany is not perceived as bad or unreliable. Only slightly less unreliable than before, according to your source. We are people on reddit commenting diarrhea and political posturing from twitter. This is not representative for a government that may or may not buy arms from Germany and it is not representative for an electorate that might influence that decision. 

As a final point I would like to direct your attention to your first source with the headline *Ukrainians slam 'unreliable' Germany as it blocks Estonia from sending arms to Kyiv*. This was in early 2022, and in late 2022 Ukraine still ordered [18 remote-controlled howitzers from the german company KMW](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3644955-germany-begins-to-produce-rch-155-howitzers-for-ukraine.html).

One perspective could be that less reliance would be for all of Europe to keep its tanks where they are, and have the US send M1’s directly to Ukraine — but if that were to happen I think it would just look like the US was projecting its strength around the world again and that Europe was reliant on the US to stop Russian aggression in Europe.

>Literally every country with a public healthcare system has a far more strict immigration system,

That is simply not true. Look at the numbers: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/16/upshot/comparing-immigration-policies-across-countries.html

If the US allowed as high of a percentage of its own population as Canada and much of Europe in as legal immigrants, millions of more people would come in per year. The US is already more strict than most of them, it just focuses more on accepting family ties vs specialized workers. Sure, reform would be great, but again, it is a miniscule problem compared to nationwide healthcare.

The annual cost of healthcare in the US is over $4 trillion dollars.

Even if you were to completely ignore every penny illegal immigrants pay in taxes and benefits they provide to their communities, the cost wouldn't exceed a couple tens of billion dollars. Two whole orders of magnitude of a smaller issue. 

It would be like you saying that you can't get a pack of new toothbrushes for the people in your family because despite your wife's toothbrush falling apart, your son's missing, your mom's being wildly expensive to maintain, you like yours being six months old, it is kind of ok, and don't want to accidentally pay for part of your cousin's...



>I work in public sector and get insurance through the federal government

Also, that in no way guarantees coverage at all healthcare facilities in the US or with all of the providers at those facilities. There are many insurance programs through the federal government and they all have their ups and down. I'm also personally familiar with a couple, including Tricare and Blue Cross's federal offerings...

An implication you seemed to be saying was that since it had never happened, it was destined to never happen. If that's not what you meant than fair enough, disregard my previous comment. 

As for Russia would not send troops over EU borders... Why not? If they successfully took Ukraine in three days, there would be no response from the West like there is now. 

There are certainly scenarios that Russia was threatening to enact on EU members. 

For example, the Swedish island of Gotland was regularly targetted in Russian media. It would give them massive control over the Baltic Sea.

So in other words, it is not more strict in any meaningful way. 

Your link requires a paid subscription, but let’s review the CA immigration requirements for a permanent visa: an allotment of points based on age, income, employment status, education and professional certifications and language competencies. 

Let’s compare that to the requirements in the US: 

1. Be related to someone who qualifies for citizenship under the  below requirements. 

Or. . . be an unskilled worker (literally the easiest qualification conceivable to get a green card.) 

Or. . . were granted refugee or asylum at least 1 year prior. 

There’s tons of ways to qualify very easily for a green card, and you only need to have a green card for a few years before you’re eligible for full citizenship, which is itself an incredibly easy process that requires only passing a simple test and character evaluation. 

The US has, by a wide margin, the easiest path to permanent visa and citizenship. For many European countries, there’s literally no path to even getting an extended visa without having an advanced degree, very gainful employment or huge amount of disposable income. Even then, the path to citizenship is another battle entirely. 

There’s very few places in which I could expect a permanent visa. Even with an advanced degree, other countries have additional protectionist employment laws that are pretty much non existent in the US, and would put me on the bottom list for employment in their country.",1674443814.0,1674443033.0,t3_10iahp0,t1_j5hv7gs,,7,0,0,0,0,0,
