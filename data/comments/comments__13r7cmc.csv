https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:313810/mmsi:273294580/imo:9340609/vessel:COMMANDER

I think he is really onto something. This is all speculation but I think everything would make a lot of sense if we posit that Ivan Khurs has been sunk. Here's why:

1) The ship in question, Commander, is a multi-purpose ship that is equipped for, and has even previously been dedicated to, subsea operations. For example, it has a big moonpool that ROVs can be lowered through. Just the kind of vessel that would make sense to use for searching for a wreck on the bottom on the sea.

2) It's hard to find information on who the current owner of the ship actually is. It was sold in 2021, but the seller did not state who the buyer was, and no company announced themselves as the new owners either, and there is no company name/logo on the vessel. Which would be strange if it was a commercial entity. We only know that it's Russian. So it is likely the Russian government that owns it.

3) The ship is currently moving in a strange pattern, and has been ever since at least yesterday (the day of the attack). The pattern is that it moves along a line for about 7-8 km, stops/drifts for an hour or two, then continues moving another 7-8 km along the line, stops/drifts for another hour or two, and so on. This seems to me like it would be consistent with a ship that is searching for something. 

4) News yesterday said that the Ivan Khurs attack took place 74 km north of the Bosporus strait. This is not quite where Commander is, **however**, if we draw a line from 74 km north of the Bosporus strait, directly to Sevastopol, Commander *is* on this line. Not only that, but remember the line that the ship is moving along while it is searching or whatever it is doing? That line overlaps with the line to Sevastopol.

So what does this mean? How about this. After the attack, Ivan Khurs was heavily damaged, but it didn't immediately sink. Instead it started sailing toward Sevastopol to get repaired. However the damage was too heavy, it started taking in water, and after around 50 km it finally did sink, or at least lose power so that no one could contact it. Russian MoD got word that it was lost, but did not have exact coordinates, they only knew the approximate location and that it was heading for Sevastopol. So they call for a nearby subsea-capable vessel of theirs, Commander, and orders it to search for Ivan Khurs along this trajectory, leading to the track we can see on the marinetraffic website.",False,1685043993.0,t3_13r7cmc,t3_13r7cmc,,0,123,0,123,0,0,

>Yevgeny Prigozhin said about half of those who died in the eastern Ukrainian city were Russian convicts recruited for the 15-month-old war. His figures stood in stark contrast to Moscow’s widely disputed claims that just over 6,000 of its troops were killed throughout the war as of January. By comparison, official Soviet troop losses in the 1979-89 Afghanistan war were 15,000.

The 75-year-old man was released, the journalist is still in captivity in an unknown place in Russia. The Commissioner for Human Rights estimates the number of detained people at about 20,000. 

Another instance: ""On the day of the full-scale invasion, my family was in Mariupol, I was in Kyiv. I took a car and went to evacuate them,"" began his story, 53-year-old V'yacheslav Zavalnyi. ""I was detained by the russians at a checkpoint. The soldiers who guarded me at first did not show aggression. When the officers arrived, interrogation began. They suspected I was a Ukrainian intelligence officer, shot near my head, shot at my feet and demanded that I write a confession.""

""We spent three days in a basement in Melitopol. It was especially difficult for two Ukrainian soldiers who changed into civilian clothes and tried to escape. They were beaten all night. Then we were transported to Olenivka, where I spent 2 weeks. If there were 600 people there at that time, when I left there were 2,000. Then we were transported to the russian prison - Kursk SIZO No. 1. I draw your attention to the names of these prisons, because they have chiefs, they are famous.""

""On May 6, after repeated beatings, we were transferred to a correctional colony in Tulsa region. Throughout the summer of 2022, we were given very little food. I was released and returned home only on January 8, 2023 as a result of exchange. My wife and son are now in Berlin. We still haven't met. We only talk on Skype.""

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-25-23/index.html

""Moscow and Minsk have signed an agreement on deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, statements from both countries’ defense ministries say.

At a bilateral meeting in the Belarusian capital, the defense ministers of Russia and Belarus, Sergei Shoigu and Viktor Khrenin, signed documents defining the procedure for storing Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons in a specialized facility in Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbor.

Shoigu said that the Belarusian side received the Iskander-M operational-tactical missile system, capable of using missiles not only in conventional but also in nuclear equipment.

“Part of the Belarusian aircraft has been converted for the possible use of nuclear weapons. The servicemen have undergone appropriate training,” Shoigu added.

“The Republic of Belarus is interested in the further development of strategic allied relations with the Russian Federation in the military sphere,” Khrenin told Shoigu, as cited by the Belarusian press service.

Some background: Belarus has been one of Russia’s most loyal allies since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine last year.

While President Alexander Lukashenko has claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked, Belarus has been willing to provide other means of support.

Lukashenko raised the possibility of Russia placing strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus during a national address in March, while baselessly accusing Western countries of “preparing to invade” Belarus and “destroy” it.

Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told CNN at the time of the initial talks that Russia’s decision to station tactical nuclear weapons in its neighbor “aims to subjugate Belarus.”""",False,1685019535.0,t3_13r7cmc,t3_13r7cmc,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Like, it’s good to say *something*, but I don’t know who this is for beyond maybe a few non-hardliners with limited power in the majles. The mullahs and IRGC know exactly what they’re getting out of it and approve. They **are** an evil state. They have no problem doing the same things and supporting fellow dictators. Their supporters don’t think and are lost. Even if they changed their mind it wouldn’t matter.

But the majority already don’t support the regime or its priorities. They keep protesting and dying for their trouble. It’s not like people haven’t noticed how oil money gets spent on needless military ventures abroad while ordinary people can’t get even basic medicine (that’s not under sanctions). The old line of it being the US’s fault doesn’t work anymore.

It seems like most Iranians feel abandoned by the international community. They live under a totalitarian dictatorship that’s currently on its nth murder spree against its own people. They kinda have their own crisis and evil state to deal with. 

People’s focus is mostly on either staying alive, getting out, or getting rid of the regime. They know they have almost no actual power or say in government, and they longer believe it’s capable of reform. Nothing gets solved while it exists, including the sending of drones to Ukraine. They’re working on the root problem, but there’s a lot of despair and desperation.

Speaking to “the people” as if they have any real say, or support the regime, or haven’t been resisting is probably more isolating than persuading IMO, and kinda comes across like he’s unaware of the situation there.

Is that in international waters? I assume so. I would guess that Ukraine waited until it was clear that they weren't operating in any other country's territorial waters, to avoid any diplomatic issues.

I'm trying to think of the implications - like, Ukraine has proven that they can hit Russian ships pretty much anywhere in the Black Sea, which is giving Russia something else to worry about.

Also, I don't know how many Black Sea fleet ships Russia still has outside of the Black Sea that they can bring back to port (they're the only warships that can enter, for those who don't know), but now it's clear that Ukraine can track them and attack them as soon as they pass through the straits and enter international waters.

If they are training on Challenger Tanks they will probably go to the nearest country that has them in their army and available for training. The same would go for F-16s. 

If you just mean training for soldiers that doesn't include heavy equipment then it's probably based on the scenarios they want to cover and who has the best facilities to offer in the immediate area. I mean if they wanted to train for winter warfare they'd probably go to Finland over Spain because those conditions are easier to replicate there. 

But if it's just regular training not dependent on any particular scenarios then I'd imagine they'd train in countries that were the most accessible to Ukraine and had the availability to do so. Maybe they'd also alternate countries from time to time as well just because different nations might have different insights that get forgotten or overlooked by others, but I imagine for Ukraine anyways it's what is most accommodating for them as soon as possible",False,1685034339.0,t3_13r7cmc,t1_jlk42lh,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

For a simple example of what that could be like: In the USA it is generally _required_ to wash eggs. In the EU, it is illegal to wash them. There are plausible reasons for both (of course, the EU's approach is better, cuz.. EU vs USA, it's not exactly a fair fight). That sort of thing needs to be unified, and it is extremely difficult for a country to go: Remember, The Xth of August is EU day and all laws just switch over, some of which in fact do a 180º turn even. Because that egg thing? That a hundred thousand times over.

The existing EU members were partly already moving towards common frameworks and used very similar law basis (there's some advantage to all having some napoleonic roots), and the EU's laws itself were built up based on needing to create a common framework amongst most existing EU members. Adding new members _now_ is a long slog where the country that wants to join needs to spend a decade or so refactoring their laws so that you don't get nasty surprises (with things being required one day and illegal the day after, for example).

Ukraine's history with EU membership has been tumultuous; just like your average Finn and your average Swede was against NATO membership only 2 years ago – __things changed__, and __now__ Ukraine is convinced they want to join the EU, and the EU is convinced that in due time they should be accepted.

It's different in many ways but the overall picture isn't much different. The current reality is that anyone that's against the government has the door open to leave. This ensure the government that there won't be a power vacuum. Anyone else can be cherry-picked and put in jail silently. At the end of the day, you get a society of yes-man or people too passive to do anything about it.

But it's worse than that because now people are living in a complete alternative universe. Speaking with relatives in Russia is very difficult if not impossible. It's like listening to a broken record. 

> Putin only has a shaky mafia of underlings who all seem to despise him

That's not true, Putin has a lot of real follower. A lot of children were born and raised without seeing anything else in the government. Imagine you've been raised all your life that Putin is the saviour of Russia and all problems in Russia are resolved by him and all the problem that Russia has are the fault of the western countries and the freedom they brought to Russia when URSS collapsed.

If today Putin was replaced by someone else wishing to revert things back to normal. This would be a hell of a hangover for the Russian society after being zombified for the last 12 years at the very least.

Isn't the *complete* lack of any fucks being given about other people dying by Putin roughly equal to the complete lack of any fucks being given about other people dying by Hitler?

the remaining countries are fairly split with many vocal elements & troll farms being pro russian including Africa, South America and the Muslim world.  most have entirely stayed out

the US and former East bloc with Russian borders are the biggest backer financially and militarily.  remaining NATO is supportive but more tentative.  Switzerland is especially tentative.  the Japanese, South Koreans, Aussies and NZ fit here too.

Of course, there's a fine line for Russia to walk here though: being outnumbered, their intervention force would need to use a show of force to balance the equation. On one hand, Russia's typical tactic is to hit hard enough that it frightens protestors into continuing and accepting rule quietly, but not so hard so as to provoke outrage and incentivise people to fight even harder. So far that has worked successfully for them in Russia (especially the 2012-2013 protests against Putin's return), but also against Belarus too in the recent uprising. They limit extreme force to isolated pockets of activity, hold the rest back, and loudly push the carrot and stick narrative that they want to let people keep living their lives happily (under their authority) but ""extremists"" pay dearly. 

However, the Kremlin had a lot less on its plate during the past uprisings, and Putin almost certainly feels a *lot* more paranoid and desperate than he was.

Once again about the #counteroffensive. Without further questions.

1. This is not a ""single event"" that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon.
2. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the #Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.
3. Intensive destruction of enemy logistics is also a counteroffensive.

Some comparisons to Nazi Germany are worthwhile to consider. Many people seem to erroneously think that Hitler ran a very tight, well-oiled, and highly stratified dictatorship, but in reality it was very similar to what we see in Russia: a system built around pleasing one man, with various factions and departments all trying to interpret his wishes in ways that frequently conflicted with each other and created bureaucratic headaches. The population also, as historians have shown repeatedly, that the population knew enough about what was happening to the Jews to not be entirely innocent, and they were largely okay with it. Without considering the comparison too closely I'd say the main differences is that Hitler killed a lot more people (so far), and his generals were a lot more competent.

Before the invasion, they even set a goal: the reduction of the Soviet population by 30 million people. Even if Bucha and Iripin were planned beforehand (we have no evidence for that, though) the scale of planning and method would be totally different. 

The Nazis were committed to annihilating Jews, understanding Jewish people as a race, Putin wants to destroy Ukrainian culture, yes this is genocide, but on a very different scale. Trying to repress a culture with its language out of existence is way different.

They are 30 million a piece. On paper.

However that's for the shovel, the cost to assemble the shovel is usually done by a manufacturer and client (Say Komatsu) alongside many contractors and ends up taking 2-3 months. That nearly costs an additional 10-15 million.

Yearly maintenance costs are about another 10 million.

A 797 haul truck is 8 million, we relife trucks by sending them back where they are stripped to structure and we get a ""new"" truck(it is effectively new but has same frame etc), and relife trucks cost 5 million. But that's the cost of a truck, the actual 797 cost over it's lifetime can be 10-15 million before relife.

Now mind you these are costs people never see, they see a price tag and don't understand that is the technical cost of the product, and for the example of electrical shovels, that's selling the shovel, in parts, which requires incredible logistics to get to site and takes months to build and test, which is not included in the sticker price.

Now mind you, I really do not buy 10 f16s costing 1 billion, and while the ""sticker"" price is 33 million, that's just for the plane. Which may come in parts and require retrofitting or assembly which may cost an additional 10 million, alongside a MASSIVE logistics chain and MASSIVE pars and MASSIVE maintenance chain, to where costs balloon to insane levels.

At their average daily losses so far they can't really sustain it. 

To put it in another perspective, the daily losses are on average 500. This isn't including things like counteroffensives, raids, so on so forth where more losses will occur.

WW1 lasted 1566 days. At just the current trajectory, they will be around 700k losses if it lasts the same amount of length from when they declared the special operation, but chances are if it lasts the same amount it'll most likely be 800k plus which is near their estimated WW1 total losses of 900k - 1.5m. Which doesn't include that most of the losses in WW1 were more from other regions of the Russian Empire.

It's not so much whether a battle lasts a week or several months. Just that daily losses from Russia is entirely and unfathomably unsustainable in any type of long war which this will most likely be.

Democracy certainly has advantages over other governments, and some disadvantages as well.

Nobody is waiting for an environmental impact study, or input from local NIMBY residents.  It just gets done.

I frequently see these things misreported, taken out of context, misunderstood, filtered through the perceptions/prejudices of those reporting it, etc.

The people who *might* have inside info, like Mark Hertling and Ben Hodges, do not, of course, comment on it.

I latched on to the DoD press briefings very early on - you can sign up for email notifications, and get all kinds of info sent to your inbox. All of the press briefings are transcribed, as well as being linked to the video at the end, so you can hear/read the actual questions and answers. You also get notifications about contracts that are awarded, lists of equipment, weapons, etc. (You also get a lot stuff that is not in the least interesting, but I've not found a way to filter it out.)

For example, here is the transcript and video of the press briefing following the UDCG of June 15, 2022, where Milley makes a comment that I've not seen any reporting on (although I certainly may have missed it). What is said in the public sphere for media consumption/propaganda purposes is not a reflection of what is going on behind the scenes. (video is at the bottom of the page).

https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3064692/secretary-of-defense-austin-and-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-of-staff-gen-mille/

>Q: Yes, thank you very much. Secretary Austin, Ukraine has publicly asked for a long list of weapons, including 1,000 howitzers, 500 tanks and 300 multiple launch rocket systems. You've repeatedly stressed that U.S. assistance needs to be driven by Ukraine's needs. And with that in mind, do you think that this latest package risks providing Ukraine with too little too late?

>GEN. MILLEY: So on the -- on your question of the Donbas, but on the numbers, just real quick. I'm not sure where the number -- what you're referring to, but I've talked to General Zaluzhnyi, and we get lists. These are official requests from their Department of Defense. They asked for 10 battalions of artillery; 12 battalions of artillery were delivered. Again, I'd say 97,000 antitank systems. That's more anti-tank systems than tanks in the world. They asked for 200 tanks; they got 237 tanks. They asked for 100 infantry fighting vehicles; they got over 300. We've delivered, roughly speaking, 1,600 or so air defense systems and about 60,000 air defense rounds. This is -- when I say ""us"", I mean the international community. You're looking at 260 artillery tube systems. Either rocket or tube artillery have been already delivered. There's 383 committed, and like I said, almost half a million rounds of artillery.

>The bottom line -- and I can go down the whole list of everything -- bottom line is everything General Zaluzhnyi asked for, as rapidly as possible, we get a source through the international community, through the United States and allies and partners, and we get it done as rapidly as we can.

>So I don't know where those numbers are that you're coming from, but we are supporting.
