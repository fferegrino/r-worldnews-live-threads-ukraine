Day 280 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a very quiet day with no missile strikes or drones and just a single air raid alert, during which it was Russians who had to use their air defenses in Belgorod, and not us. I don’t even think that Kupiansk was shelled today, or at least there were no reports about it, which is unsurprising as there aren’t many people living in Kupiansk right now.

Weirdly enough today we only had a single, 1 hour long, blackout lasting from 9:30am to 10:30am, which is probably the shortest blackout we had so far. Though I don’t think it was this short for everyone, as even after the electricity was turned back on we had no internet for quite some time, so the internet provider or at least some of their infrastructure was still without electricity.

I think that the massive missile strike that was predicted might happen tomorrow, maybe even in just a couple of hours from now. For some reason they moved their missile strike 1 weekday forward every time they did one. The previous one happened on Wednesday, the one before that one happened on Tuesday, and the one two missile strikes back happened on Monday. So the next one is very likely to happen on Thursday, it is also a December 1st too, and they usually choose some easy to remember dates to do their missile strikes on, which means it probably will happen this time, and I hope we will be able to shoot down most of the missiles.

Ursula von der Leyen: Ukraine loses estimated 100,000 military personnel in war

Ursula von der Leyen, the Head of the European Commission, issued an appeal on Wednesday, in which she estimated the losses of Ukraine in the war against Russia at 100,000 military personnel.

Source: [https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/11/30/7151569/](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2022/11/30/7151569/)

Von der Leyen devoted her appeal to the plan to confiscate frozen Russian assets and create a special tribunal to punish Russia for the crimes of aggression against Ukraine.

Quote: ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20 thousand civilians and 100 thousand Ukrainian soldiers have been killed so far,"" the president of the European Commission said.

She said that Russia must pay for its terrible crimes, including the crime of aggression against a sovereign state.

The president of the European Commission noted that the EU proposed to create a specialised court with the support of the UN for the investigation and prosecution of the crime of Russian aggression.

Von der Leyen also said that Brussels, together with its partners developed a plan for the confiscation of frozen Russian assets; these are to be transferred for the needs of restoration of Ukraine and to compensate for the damage caused by the war started by the Russian Federation.

In States like CA and NY, even after being told it is illegal to basically require someone to have the right connections to have a carry permit, they're just pushing the same kinds if policies they've already been told is illegal and unconditional. If we allow that kind of thing to continue, what else could come back just because something is popular enough within a state? Factions of both the right and left like segregation. They call it by different names and like it for different reasons. But the end result would be the same. Could we trust Biden to do anything about it? If he won't stand up for an increasingly more popular thing in his base like gun rights, which only becomes more bipartisan the more gun sales go up with the economic and diplomatic uncertainties of this decade, how can we trust Biden to stand up to young university students who believe in racially segregated safe spaces and affinity groups. Especially as that kind of thing becomes more popular with kids who use tictok more than YouTube and aren't exposed to critical thought as much as millennials were?

Just an edit to this chain so no one needs to read this bullshit chain.
No one can answer what five current wars are worse because no one wants to risk saying “Syrian civil war” or “war on terror” or “war on drugs”. Those answers are absurd. The former war is almost a Cold War. About a hundred die a month for the last year. The latter two of course are not traditional wars and casualties are extremely low compared to a hot war.

The purpose of stating there are worse wars out there is to diminish the scope and impact this war has on the world. If the purpose was to inform about other wars the other wars certainly would have been mentions.

Comments like these and using logic in this commenter’s way are insidious. On the surface they are well meaning thoughtful statements, but looking into their intention or lack intention reveals a communication device that’s used to muddy the water on an otherwise black and white topic.

It's a very lopsided war of attrition. The war is now largely about forcing the enemy to retreat vs actually taking territory. That's how Russia took Sievierodonetsk and how Ukraine took Kherson. The key difference is of course the tactics and the costs. Ukraine stays on the defensive while destroying the Russian rear in depth until they can no longer hold the territory. Russia on the other hand attacks non-stop, wasting countless lives and equipment to expose Ukrainian positions, and gradually turning the front line into moonscape where no one can hide. 

Russia is suffering tremendous losses around Bakhmut, and all they can do is force a retreat from this trench or that. Ratio of losses is demonstrably insane, with handfuls of Ukrainians mowing down entire companies of Wagner ex-convicts running across open ground.

And Russia has no capabilities to take cities whatsoever. The best they can do is level them block by block. That takes them months and we're nowhere near that in Bakhmut.

That being said, the war is likely going to continue for the foreseeable future. Neither Russia nor Ukraine are willing to entertain the idea of a ceasefire, surrender, or peaceful negotiation. 

I see only three ways this war will end. 

First, the best case, Ukraine pushes Russia out completely and regains its territory. I think that this is actually the most likely possibility, as the Russian army is simply a mess and bleeding resources and manpower like mad. The Russians lack the ability to fight forever and I think there forces will fall apart if enough pressure is applied.

Second, the middle case, is that Russia and Ukraine agree to a ceasefire. This would mean that Russia will likely keep control of some of the currently occupied territories. I do not see this happening however, as Russia has ""annexed"" Ukrainian territory it never even controlled, and Ukraine rightfully worries that a ceasefire will give Russia time to build up for a 3rd war. 

However, war weariness is a thing, and while not likely today should enough time pass. Both Russia and Ukraine may be willing to actually negotate a deal everyone would hate.

The key variable they need out of the model is how strongly death rate correlates with energy price.  The issue is that energy price and weather are connected by a causal effect, making them degenerate variable in your fit space.  As such, neither variable can be well pinned down without a lot more technical and rigorous modeling work which I seriously doubt they have done for this article.  

Specifically, it's hard to pin down whether an alleged increase in deaths is the results of high gas prices, or the cold weather which caused the high gas prices.  This year we know the extremely high gas prices will not be correlated with the weather in the same way, so if your model doesn't fully understand that effect, it will have precisely zero predictive power.  

If you a) blame it all on the weather which pushes up the prices, you'll get an answer that only a few extra deaths will results.  If you b) blame it all on the energy price, then we'll see a very large number of extra deaths.  I am extremely skeptical from the description of their model that the paper has not done even the most basic work to sort this out, meaning I would consider the conclusions of the model and their article to have exactly zero predictive power.

Firstly, they say that ""previously change in energy prices had not significantly affected mortality"", and immediately afterwards they nevertheless build *statistical* model that supposedly correlates higher prices to higher number of deaths. Something something correlation vs causation.

Secondly, for their baseline deaths estimate they use average deaths in 2000-2019, tactfully forgetting that there may be other factors in play and that, in fact, in 2020 and 2021 the number of said deaths was significantly higher than the used baseline, and the same is true throughout 2022 so far.

Simply put, this model is not particularly credible.

Article 14 *bis*, para 15 explicitly excludes jurisdiction  “[i]n respect of a State [i.e, Russia] that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory.” You can almost certainly thank the US (a non-State Party/signatory) for the addition of this exculpatory clause. Ultimately, the ICC should may still exercise jurisdiction for all the Russian war crimes committed on Ukrainian territory with the sole exception of the war crime of aggression. 

I’ll leave up my comment in case anyone is interested about this issue.

> **The only way the ICC can be called in to judge Russia's war is through a decision by the UN Security Council** — something that Russia, with its permanent seat on the council, would veto.

> To get around that, von der Leyen is proposing to have a court set up in an EU country that could tackle Russia specifically on the crime of aggression while leaving war crimes and crimes against humanity to the ICC.

I know that this is a quote from the article, but I don’t think this is accurate.

Article 13 of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf) governs when the ICC may have jurisdiction.

The article looks to be referring to statute 13(b), which provides jurisdiction in: “[a] situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.”

However, the ICC can also exercise jurisdiction via Article 13(a) & 13(c). For example, Article 13(a) allows the ICC to exercise jurisdiction in a “situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is **referred to the Prosecutor by a State Party** in accordance with article 14.” Multiple western countries that have signed the Rome Statute have already made referrals to the ICC, and Ukraine has also accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC under Article 12*. Exercising jurisdiction through Article 13(a) does not require the approval of the UN Security Council, and therefor Russia does not have the unilateral ability to veto Article 13(a) jurisdiction.

*Article 12 allows a non-State Party to accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC with respect to “the crime in question.”",1669823513.0,1669822560.0,t3_z8gmn4,t1_iycnla6,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

**Caveat**:  I'm not able to back this up with a link, as I believe I originally heard it on the radio while traveling a few days ago, and I don't have time to google it atm.

My understanding is that they're using missiles that were originally only designed for nuclear warheads, but removing the warheads and putting replacement ballast onto them.  Given that the missiles were designed to carry nuclear warheads, I don't think they're very accurate so them carrying a conventional warhead is mostly pointless.

With their nuclear warheads, those missiles are useless to Russia in a conventional conflict.  However, by removing the warhead, they are a little-bit useful as decoys.

It's interesting to me that they seem to be diminishing their nuclear capability in order to get a small advantage over Ukraine.

* In July 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved amendments to the 2012 'Foreign Agents Law', which has been widely used to repress opponents of the regime. The new measures are scheduled to come into force on 01 December 2022.
* The 2012 law defined 'foreign agents' as individuals or organisations who have received financial support from abroad. The amendments will extend the definition to those which are merely under undefined 'influence or pressure' of foreign actors. The Ministry of Justice will also have the power to publish the personal details and addresses of designated 'foreign agents', almost certainly placing them at risk of harassment.
* The new laws will further extend the repressive powers available to the Russian state. This continues a trend since Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, but which has dramatically accelerated since the invasion of Ukraine.

Yes. A tank is not significantly more difficult to adopt, maintain, and incorporate than a advanced SPG like the Pzh2000. And Ukraine demonstrated it can do that just fine.

>Ukraine is fighting smart right now. Let them continue to do so.

Ukraine is fighting with what they have. They need tanks and IFVs. Western analysts say so. Zelenskiy has said so. 

General Zaluzhny said that for Ukraine to achieve it's goals in 2023 it needs 10-20 new combined arms brigades [Source](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3566404-prospects-for-running-a-military-campaign-in-2023-ukraines-perspective.html)

The Ukrainian military has relied on Starlink to coordinate its troops even as the Russian military has damaged internet and communications infrastructure in the country. In June, Musk said that SpaceX had delivered 15,000 Starlink units to Ukraine.

Numbers on the finances are hard to come by, but the U.S. government has paid for at least a portion of these terminals—documents analyzed by the Washington Post show that the United States Agency for International Development purchased more than 1,330 Starlink terminals and paid for their transportation along with the transportation of 3,670 terminals donated by SpaceX. USAID paid $1,500 apiece for terminals SpaceX retails for $600 and charges $110 a month for service. USAID referred to the project as a “public-private partnership.”

This information directly contradicts what SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told CNBC in March. “I don’t think the U.S. has given us any money to give terminals to the Ukraine,” Shotwell said. At the time, she did note that most of the funding for Starlink terminals being given to Ukraine came mostly from private sources, with some help from the governments of France and Poland.

Without release of further financial information, determining how much of the Starlink project was underwritten by the United States and how much was paid for by SpaceX itself is not possible. What is clear, is that the United States did not pay for all of the terminals as claimed in the tweet. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.""

You didn't actually explain why term ""appeasement"" and the comparisons to 1938 Munich aren't applicable. You just flatly asserted that they weren't, because you don't like them.

The reality is that the comparison is apt, because Russia is exactly the same sort of expansionist, ethnonationalist, genocidal power that Nazi Germany was.

You're arguing for appeasement of and capitulation to the 21st century equivalent of Nazi Germany. For the West to allow an imperialist power to openly commit genocide in front of the whole world in exchange for cheap gas.

Russia's long game should have been to withdraw after the 3 day blitz failed, call it a successful defence of the breakaway regions and a warning to Ukraine to ""stop threatening them and their people"" (Russian propaganda style), let the dust settle and relationships normalise again (5-10 years), then polonium tea the next President and reinstall a puppet.

Russia's and Putin's egos fucked them hard on this one. Every day they don't withdraw, the price of withdrawing gets even higher (not to mention the losses incurred by trying to stay). They are utterly fucked every which way now, and withdrawing is *still* their best and only viable option.
