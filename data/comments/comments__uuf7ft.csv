Day 87 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was pretty quiet around my area today, quieter than yesterday, there was no incoming shelling, but we still hear our artillery all the time. They shelled Saltivka again and injured 5 people, but thankfully no one died. A lot of people are returning, but it still isn’t all that safe in the city, we still need to be cautious at all times.

It was pretty tempting to go look around destroyed districts as there was no shelling for some time, but because it started again, it’s probably still too dangerous to go. You never know when shelling will start, so going somewhere like Northern Saltivka will most likely remain dangerous all the way until the end of the war, or at least until Russians are completely pushed back from the entire Kharkiv oblast, and even then their MLRS will still be in range of the city.

Apparently subway will already resume work on the 24th, which is much sooner than it was initially expected. At first it was said that subway won’t be operational until 2-3 months after the war ends, but it’s already reopening, everything is happening much faster than originally predicted.

Today our army reported Ternova being shelled, so it might not have been retaken by the Russians after all. Technically it was never even reported as being liberated, so it was probably contested all this time. Also Arestovich confirmed that our forces are moving in the direction of Vovchansk from the south (on the east side of Donets, meaning that it is already crossed), but without giving any more details. If all goes well, Russians might lose one of their supply lines to Izyum.",False,1653179326.0,t3_uuf7ft,t3_uuf7ft,,0,160,0,160,2,0,

**Russia’s Media Machine: Interview with U.S. Expert Julia Davis**

*(...)*

*Now we see Moscow’s hubris catching up. Do the Kremlin’s propagandists continue to tell their public that things are going well in Ukraine?*  
  
*--- Even the most ardent propagandists are now acknowledging that the Ukrainian troops are formidable opponents, that Western sanctions are there to stay, and that NATO is fighting against Russia in Ukraine – which of course is a lie. They’re also ludicrously blaming Ukrainians for destroying their own cities and killing their own civilians.*  
  
*What else are Vladimir Putin’s propagandists now saying about Ukraine?*  
  
*--- Putin’s propagandists are promoting bloodthirsty ideas of killing not only the Ukrainian leadership and the country’s brave defenders, but also an internal crackdown against anyone who dares to oppose or even criticize the madness of Putin’s invasion of a peaceful neighboring nation that has never been at war since achieving its independence ,That is, until the Kremlin felt its influence slipping away with Yanukovych’s inglorious departure*  
  
*Based on what you see in Russian TV broadcasts, do you think that the propagandists themselves are becoming concerned that things are not going as they had anticipated in Ukraine?*  
  
*--- Russian state TV propagandists are becoming more and more unhinged, threatening the world with nuclear weapons and their own opposition with persecution and prosecution. The magnitude of their misrepresentations is at its peak.*  
  
*Why?*  
  
*--- They’re caught in their own web of lies, with mounting casualties, economic struggles and no tangible victories. Instead of announcing grand successes as they previously predicted, they’re reduced to explaining why they aren’t being achieved. Other than elusive assertions of Russia restoring its historical grandeur, they have no positives to mention.*

""Constant respect for people,"" he said. ""This war, our unification, is a proof that we have such people. I'm proud of that.""

In the wide-ranging interview, he also talked about the defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, who surrendered this week after holding out for months against the Russian invasion.

""We will bring them home,"" he said of the Ukrainian fighters who are now held by Russia.

He described victory as Ukrainian forces reaching the lines of control from before the invasion without unnecessary losses.

""We broke the backbone of one of the strongest armies in the world. They won't get back on their feet in the next few years,"" Zelensky said.

**Turkey, NATO, and the Ukraine war: Why Erdogan’s grievances are about more than Sweden and Finland**

*(...)*

*“We are following developments. We currently do not have a positive \[favourable\] position on the issue of Sweden and Finland \[joining NATO\],” Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul. “Scandinavian countries are like terrorist groups’ guesthouses,” he continued, referring to the presence in Sweden of exiled Gulenists and sympathisers of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – which Ankara views as a terrorist organisation that has tentacles in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq.*    
  
*This was an obstacle in an otherwise well-choreographed Nordic march into NATO. Was Erdogan trying to put pressure on the US Congress for those F-16s that Ankara wants to purchase? Was this really about more money for Syrian refugees in Turkey? Or did he really want Gulenists or PKK sympathisers extradited to Turkey?*  

*(...)*

*Meanwhile, Sweden is an easy pick for any Turkish leader, but especially one in an alliance with nationalists at home. Swedish foreign policy’s focus on human rights, gender equality, and diversity is almost anathema to the male-dominated, conservative political culture in Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party.* 

*(...)*

*Europe’s strategic landscape is changing fast, and Turkey, increasingly seeing itself as a friendless loner, does not want to be caught in crossfire.*    
  
*In all likelihood, Erdogan will soften his stance in the coming weeks following pleas from NATO partners. A call from Joe Biden would help, but so too would addressing other issues, such the EU agreeing to expedite the new tranche of its migration deal with Turkey, or lift some of its export restrictions on Turkey’s defence industry.*

* They'll try to spin it in such a way that they're the reasonable ones and Ukraine are the stubborn ones who want to keep the war doing 
* The Italian proposal for a ceasefire which got recently made public is probably exactly that 
* The Russians will also try to slow down weapons shipments by this approach 
* He also put in perspective Zelenskyy's about ""only diplomacy can end this war"" - the Russians will go back to borders of the 23rd, either voluntarily or forced, then there's going to be diplomacy about the rest, and if the Russians still don't want to see reason then there's going to be a military taking back of the Donbass and possibly Crimea

Poland has provided Ukraine with a huge stockpile of spare parts for MiG-29 fighters and weapons for them.
This was reported by informants of the Polish newspaper Onet , writes ""European Truth"".
From the very beginning of the war, the Ukrainian authorities asked the West for support with fighter jets. Initially, it was possible to transfer Soviet MiG-29 fighters, which were in service with the Polish, Slovak and Bulgarian armies. However, these plans were never implemented.
However, according to the publication, Poland has handed over to Ukraine almost all its spare parts and weapons for MiG-29 aircraft. Thanks to this, Ukraine was able to restore the combat capability of its existing fighters.

 
Recently, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov addressed NATO with a request to train Ukrainian pilots to fly Western fighters. According to Reznikov, it is time to teach Ukrainians to fly the American A-10 Thunderbolt, as well as F-15 and F-16 fighters. 
Reznikov added that **""negotiations are already underway.""**
In mid-April, the Pentagon confirmed that the Ukrainian military had increased the size of its combat fleet after receiving spare parts from the Allies and repairing damaged aircraft.


Holy shit as a military history buff. This would be incredible would be very cool. If I remember correctly the f-15 and f-16 never fought migs. Only there father f-4 phantoms.  F-15 was basically made because of the Russians. I’d imagine the pilots would be trained at top gun.",1653142186.0,1653141715.0,t3_uuf7ft,t3_uuf7ft,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

Russia's war in Ukraine has become an increasingly grinding and bloody affair, with each side wearing the other down. Both claim to have made recent gains. But they've also suffered setbacks.



Overall, Russia is still the dominant force and has significant military might - but there has been no swift victory as planned. Here, we take a closer look at some of the things which could tilt the outcome in favour of either party.

*▪️A large grouping is concentrated in Nikolaev and Krivoy Rog for a counteroffensive on the positions of the RF Armed Forces. The strike is planned to be carried out in three areas: from Novovorontsovka, from Pervomaisky, and also in the direction of Aleksandrovka. The total grouping of enemy troops includes up to 32 battalion tactical groups.*

 ▪️Over the past 24 hours, racists fired at Oleksiyivka and Saltivka from multiple rocket launchers.  The rocket strike actually destroyed the Lozova House of Culture.

In addition, according to British intelligence, Russian crews are avoiding flights over Ukrainian territory, probably due to the threat from Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile systems.

 ▪️ The SBU examination showed that the rocket attack on the Kramatorsk railway station was carried out from the occupied Donetsk region.

Firstly. Yes. Russia isn’t fighting NATO. But it isn’t fighting Ukraine either. Ukraine is heavily supplied with a lot of stuff that it wouldn’t have otherwise.

Secondly. Negotiations are for people who want to negotiate. Russia isn’t interested in walking back or ceasefire. It had plenty of opportunities and it turned all of them down. The best one it had was 48 hours into the invasion when Zelensky promised he won’t join NATO. It could have just gone back with that promise and the world would not have laughed at Russia at all. 

Now it is stuck fighting Ukraine which has so much stuff that Russia never thought it would have and all the intelligence of the world. And it needs to go back with whatever Putin can take as a decisive victory. 

Putin is a seasoned dictator and I never pegged him to be a stupid man. He has maintained power for a very long time and kept his people in check.

1) Twitter disinfo and Reddit disinfo operations are vastly different. What's easy to do on Twitter is not easy on Reddit, and vice versa. With Twitter, all you need is a somewhat aged account, and those can be created en masse using simple scripts.  Wheras Reddit has a ton of automation for detecting inactive, compromised, or new accounts.  Effective accounts have consistent history that's hard to fake with a makarov chain bot or other scripts, so it's much more expensive to make fake Reddit accounts. 

Because of this, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate things happening on Twitter to here.

It would be the weapon Ukraine needs it would be a weapon that would likely colapse the entire Russian frontline and pretty much force to them to retreat to much farther behind the border.

US MLRS if it happens than that is it. That combined with M777 and mobile artilerry platforms the received. There is just no way dor Russia to hold that frontline you can expect a complete and utter collapse of the Russia armed forces in Ukraine.

470db0d048df0e337991662f401128f0,uuf7ft,i9hcu51,"Lend-Lease is a term for a program that was developed during the early part of World War II.

The US was neutral. Among other things, neutrality protected US ships, which was the mainstay of transportation and logistics during this time.

But as a neutral nation, the US couldn't *give* war materiel to allied nations, doing so would violate neutrality, bring the US into the war, and endanger US shipping.

The Axis, aka Nazis, didn't want the US in the war because the US had a huge industrial base that couldn't be attacked. The Allies didn't want the US in the war because they didn't want the US shipping targeted by Nazi U-boats.

So we came up with a fig leaf; a program that implied we weren't *giving* war materiel to the Allies. This was implied by the name; Lend-Lease.

The official stance was that the US was ""lending or leasing"" war materiel to allied nations, but we hadn't worked out the specific terms for the lend or lease. We'd figure out the terms when the war was over.

The reality was that the US was using it's huge, protected (by distance) industrial base to manufacture an unimaginable amount of war materiel, then using it's protected (by ""neutrality"") shipping industry to bring that materiel to the allied nations.

This support was critical in Russia's defense against the Nazi invasion. Lend-lease, without exaggeration, saved Russia from the fate of Poland, France, and many other European nations that had fallen to Nazi aggression.

Fast forward to 2022. Lend-lease, as enacted today, is significant, but not nearly as significant as the spending bills that have been passed. The USSR and the US have established conventions around fighting proxy wars that make the fig leaf subterfuge of lend-lease irrelevant. There's a lot more detail here, but just accept this: Proxy war conventions have made lend-lease largely irrelevant.

What's important is the name. Lend-lease is a very pointed reminder that without US support, the USSR, and by extension Russia, would have been overrun and captured by Nazis. The same US support that enabled Russians to resist Nazi aggression is now being extended to Ukraine. It's extremely powerful and pointed symbolism that says:

>We see you in the same light we saw Nazi Germany. We are supporting Ukraine the way we supported USSR against Nazi Germany. The end results are going to be the same: The invaders will be beaten back and humiliated. And if you make a military attack against anything US or NATO, we'll treat it like Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor. Only one nation in the world has had the will, the means, and the motive to nuke another nation. Our threats have teeth. We are on the razor's edge from stepping in and ROFLstomping your bitch ass into a pink mist.

However, that's all implied, that's all subtext. That's the unspoken meaning of passing a bill called ""lend-lease."" Russia knows what's implied. Russia knows the subtext. At the same time, the US has plausible deniability around the heavy threats that are implied by ""lend-lease.""",False,1653160628.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9gwgby,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Russia runs out of troops or morale.  Ukraine can get more troops, almost endless troops - it just doesn't want to lose them.

There's a complicated legal framework surrounding what can be given to Ukraine.  Lend-lease (US) will change that calculus significantly. But this sort of thing has always been kind of a political hot potato; at least in the USA.  Lend-lease is actually what caused the US to get involved in WWII as a combatant. (In the Pacific theater, it was an oil embargo against Japan that caused Japan to attack the US; in the Europe theater, it was Lend Lease. Kind of pissed-off the Germans).  US was pretty isolationist through most of the 30's.  

And in fact, the US has an isolationist faction right now, and it's not insignificant. Some of these votes seem like full-support because they end up being near-unanimous, but the preliminary votes are very closely divided, and that's how the isolationist (Trump humper) faction can show their support for Russia without being overtly traitorous.

Given the schizophrenic behavior of other allies; including Germany, France, especially Italy, lately, and Serbia, Hungary, etc; you can tell there's a lot of pro-Russia sentiment that's not exactly losing the fight.

Diplomatically speaking, this is going to be a very long, tough battle - to maintain the alliance, and sanctions compliance.  I think Ukraine's lucky to have gotten the weapons they have.  (though if it were up to me, I'd absolutely have had Ukrainians training on F-16's starting in 2014, and they'd have himars, patriot, antiship missiles, the motherfucking works. Maybe a submarine or two. If it were up to me, I think I would have given Ukraine nukes too.  After 2014, for damn sure. Ruck Fussia.)",False,1653146105.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9gehud,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

https://www.algebris.com/market-views/rouble-trouble-why-the-new-russian-gas-payment-scheme-matters/

>From a technical standpoint, the impact of this structure on forced conversion of FX is relatively limited: rather than having to sell 80% of its FX revenues to the CBR, Gazprom will be forced to sell 100% of it on the Moscow stock exchange. Depending on whether the extra 20% is bought by the CBR through new rouble issuance or by other banks with the existing rouble money supply, the impact on the rouble exchange rate might be slightly different at the margin (but the exchange rate is already largely the artificial result of capital controls in place since end of February). **What is more important, however, is that the new payment structure completely cuts off the middleman (i.e. the European banks) and as such it significantly increases the risk that Russia can undermine and circumvent sanctions imposed so far.**

-

>While a lot of press has focused on the currency conversion element in the scheme, what the Russian government is demanding is not exactly to be paid for gas in roubles. The substance of the request is to be paid in hard currency in an account at government-owned Gazprombank in Russia, rather than at a Gazprom account in any Western bank.

>From Russia’s perspective, this achieves two strategic results. First, it prevents Europeans from enacting sanctions that would freeze gas payments in escrow accounts at European banks – to be accessible to Russia only after it withdraws troops from Ukraine. This option has been discussed recently, but the Russian Decree makes it very clear that Europeans cannot have their cake and eat it: as long as they want gas delivered from Russia, they will have to pay for it into a Gazprombank Russian account that cannot be frozen. If the payment is not performed according to the procedure described in the Decree, supply of gas can be halted (see next section). This puts European governments in a corner: if they want to stop Russia from accessing energy-related funds, they will have to take the politically much more difficult decision to stop importing Russian energy rather than just keep buying and withhold the money. This has already proved to be a divisive topic across the EU and the Russian move risks increasing political fragmentation at the worst time.

>**Second, gas payments under the scheme could significantly undermine already imposed sanctions. So far, Gazprombank has been allowed to maintain SWIFT access due to its role in energy transactions. But creates a risk that the bank becomes a conduit for sanctioned businesses to and from Russia. Experiences in other sanctioned jurisdictions (Iran and Venezuela) suggest that banks can become masterful at setting up front companies and layering opaque transactions so that it is almost impossible to tell who the ultimate beneficiaries of transfers are. The new gas payment scheme presents a similar opportunity: once the FX reaches Gazprombank, it becomes impossible to trace it across the system.**

-

>In conclusion, the new rouble payment scheme laid out in the March 31st Presidential Decree is far from inconsequential. It deprives European gas buyers of control on the fulfilment of their payment obligations, which is outsourced to a Russian bank in Russia. It increases the risk of Russia being able to undermine and circumvent sanctions, by cutting the middleman role currently performed by the European correspondent banks network.

>It also gives Russia full control on weaponizing the uncertainty of gas supply, by tying the fulfilment of the buyers’ payment obligation to the EUR-RUB conversion and strengthening Gazprom case for force majeure. As such, it looks more like a calculated counter-sanction move from Russia than an act of desperation – as some have described it.",False,1653143875.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9fqcgg,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

The UN has been warned that global wheat inventories have fallen to their lowest level since 2008 as food supplies are rocked by a “one-in-a-generation occurrence”.

Official government estimates put world wheat inventories at 33pc of annual consumption, but stocks may have slumped to as low as 20pc, according to agricultural data firm Gro Intelligence. It estimates that there are only 10 weeks of global wheat supply left in stockpiles.

Russia and Ukraine account for around a quarter of the world’s wheat exports and the West fears Mr Putin is trying to weaponise food supplies. Russia is on track for a strong wheat harvest this year, cementing Mr Putin’s control over the staple grain as bad weather spoils production in Europe and the US.

Gro Intelligence chief executive Sara Menker warned global food supplies are being hit by a number of “extraordinary” challenges, including fertiliser shortages, climate disruptions and record low inventories of cooking oils and grains.

She told the UN’s Security Council: “Without substantial immediate and aggressive coordinated global actions, we stand the risk of an extraordinary amount of both human suffering and economic damage.

“This isn’t cyclical, this is seismic. It’s a once-in-a-generation occurrence that can dramatically reshape the geopolitical era.”

The war has disrupted agricultural production in the region and sent global food prices soaring to a record high, stoking fears of unrest in developing countries. The crisis in wheat has been worsened by India, the world’s second largest producer, banning exports of the cereal and higher costs for farmers from fertiliser, feed and fuel.

Western officials also fear the Russian president is deliberately trying to damage global food supplies by destroying equipment and stealing grain in Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned of “apocalyptic” food price rises as Ukraine struggles to export products.

“Ukraine does have food in store but it can’t get it out at the moment,” he told MPs on the Treasury Committee.

“That is a major worry. It is not just a major worry for this country, it is a major worry for the developing world.”

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that Mr Putin is “using food as a weapon”.

“The food supply for millions of Ukrainians and millions more around the world has quite literally been held hostage.”

He added: “Some 20m tons of grain sit unused in Ukrainian silos as global food supply dwindle (and) prices skyrocket.”

Meanwhile, the Kremlin is tightening its grip on wheat supplies after a stronger harvest. Carlos Mera, head of agri commodities research at Rabobank, said mild conditions in Russia – which accounts for about a fifth of global wheat exports – had put it on track to produce 84.9m metric tonnes of the staple grain this year.

Conditions for Western growers have been poor due to dry conditions.

America’s southern plains region, as the bottom of the ""Wheat Belt"" that runs through the middle of the country, has been experiencing sustained drought conditions.

In a report earlier this month, the US Department of Agriculture forecast a major decline in wheat stocks, saying they will drop 6pc to a nine-year low of 16.8 million tonnes by the end of 2022/23.",False,1653130226.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9fold3,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

It would be far less than what the landowners royalty is paid for in the US for exploration of oil, and it would allow Russian government post-putin to continue to function-as the world doesn't need another Weimar republic there.

Zelensky has basically stated condition for victory is regaining all lost territory, including Crimea. That's a tall order.

Putin has basically stated condition for victory as a fluffy ""denazification and demilitarization"" of Ukraine and it seems his main objective, now that land bridge to Crimea has successfully been established, is to occupy the rest of Donbas which seems more within reach, sadly.

USSR didn't take over all of Finland during the Winter War either, but they were still considered victors as they got a huge swath of Finnish territory, actually more than they had demanded originally. And like I showed yesterday, USSR was losing forces at a higher rate in Finland than Russia is in Ukraine (more than 100k dead (out of 450k invading force) after 3 months vs. 30k dead (out of 190k invading force) after 3 months.

I hope international community will continue to punish Russia for many years to come, but with France and Germany giving the OK for companies to pay in rubles and Russia blackmailing the whole world with famine in Africa/ME, I have a feeling it's going to fizzle out as military intervention is apparently not an option. We already have people here saying ""Versailles treatment of Germany gave us Hitler and WW2"" so you can expect some Western politicians to adopt that view too.

The daily deluge of disinformation produced by RT and Sputnik is a vital component of the tactics that other authoritarian regimes are seeking to replicate.

>According to a report published by the Policy Institute at King’s College London, (Weaponising news: RT, Sputnik and disinformation), **RT and Sputnik distributed no fewer than seven conspiracy theories about the Skripal poisoning.**

It is to give someone the notion that a channel that exists only pushes Russian propaganda is apparently an equal and valid news source than Western sources that have freedom of the press.

That's why Russia spends huge quantities of money on propaganda because someone like you will argue that a channel entirely devoted to pushing the Russian propaganda narrative on everything is apparently equivalent to Western media which on the whole tends to have some journalistic integrity and where there are consequences both professionally and in many jurisdictions, legally for their reporting.

I don't dispute that particular Western organisations have known biases and limitations; however they are not equivalent to media (its propaganda) that is specifically designed to push a narrative and misinform people.

>From a technical standpoint, the impact of this structure on forced conversion of FX is relatively limited: rather than having to sell 80% of its FX revenues to the CBR, Gazprom will be forced to sell 100% of it on the Moscow stock exchange. Depending on whether the extra 20% is bought by the CBR through new rouble issuance or by other banks with the existing rouble money supply, the impact on the rouble exchange rate might be slightly different at the margin (but the exchange rate is already largely the artificial result of capital controls in place since end of February). **What is more important, however, is that the new payment structure completely cuts off the middleman (i.e. the European banks) and as such it significantly increases the risk that Russia can undermine and circumvent sanctions imposed so far.**

-

>While a lot of press has focused on the currency conversion element in the scheme, what the Russian government is demanding is not exactly to be paid for gas in roubles. The substance of the request is to be paid in hard currency in an account at government-owned Gazprombank in Russia, rather than at a Gazprom account in any Western bank.

>From Russia’s perspective, this achieves two strategic results. First, it prevents Europeans from enacting sanctions that would freeze gas payments in escrow accounts at European banks – to be accessible to Russia only after it withdraws troops from Ukraine. This option has been discussed recently, but the Russian Decree makes it very clear that Europeans cannot have their cake and eat it: as long as they want gas delivered from Russia, they will have to pay for it into a Gazprombank Russian account that cannot be frozen. If the payment is not performed according to the procedure described in the Decree, supply of gas can be halted (see next section). This puts European governments in a corner: if they want to stop Russia from accessing energy-related funds, they will have to take the politically much more difficult decision to stop importing Russian energy rather than just keep buying and withhold the money. This has already proved to be a divisive topic across the EU and the Russian move risks increasing political fragmentation at the worst time.

>**Second, gas payments under the scheme could significantly undermine already imposed sanctions. So far, Gazprombank has been allowed to maintain SWIFT access due to its role in energy transactions. But creates a risk that the bank becomes a conduit for sanctioned businesses to and from Russia. Experiences in other sanctioned jurisdictions (Iran and Venezuela) suggest that banks can become masterful at setting up front companies and layering opaque transactions so that it is almost impossible to tell who the ultimate beneficiaries of transfers are. The new gas payment scheme presents a similar opportunity: once the FX reaches Gazprombank, it becomes impossible to trace it across the system.**

-

>In conclusion, the new rouble payment scheme laid out in the March 31st Presidential Decree is far from inconsequential. It deprives European gas buyers of control on the fulfilment of their payment obligations, which is outsourced to a Russian bank in Russia. It increases the risk of Russia being able to undermine and circumvent sanctions, by cutting the middleman role currently performed by the European correspondent banks network.

>It also gives Russia full control on weaponizing the uncertainty of gas supply, by tying the fulfilment of the buyers’ payment obligation to the EUR-RUB conversion and strengthening Gazprom case for force majeure. As such, it looks more like a calculated counter-sanction move from Russia than an act of desperation – as some have described it.",False,1653149062.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9gcyht,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Listen, I've already said that, when you're watching RT, you should keep in mind that they're probably not going to be a good source of information *with respect to information regarding the Russian government*. I don't know how many times I need to repeat that before you're able to understand it, so I just repeated it again.

Mattis has this to say:

> In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on February 6, 2018, then–Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated “I do not think there is any such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Any nuclear weapon used any time is a strategic game changer.” Russian leaders have made clear that they would view any nuclear attack as the start of an all-out nuclear war.

So if you feel up to it I'd love to see your sources on tactical nukes being this relaxed stuff that could happen at any time because there's ""just"" some convention against it because I've never encountered ANYONE saying the same thing at least from what I remember. And as far as I'm aware tactical nukes mostly exist because strategic ones are for cities / bases while tactical ones are to take on groupings of enemy units / smaller targets. So they are made for a full scale nuclear war rather than one-offs during a random war you get extra angry during. 

These types of theoretical scenarios where nukes were used during war was common in the early cold war era (when all tanks and troops were training to operate with nuclear bombs going off all around) but we aren't in the same place now as far as I'm aware because MAD is to the point where we are pretty sure such a war wouldn't be a war but a global suicide. So it's more that tactical nukes plug a certain gap in the credible nuclear deterrence (we are ready to hit smaller military targets too besides all your major city centers and bases) than them being much more likely to be used.

Furthermore, if there was a war such as this off the US homeland or near Pearl Harbor for instance, nukes would be authorized then too. Crimea is just as important to Russia as Pearl Harbor, and is considered part of their country that 500k died for during WW2. If the US were under attack you should certainly assume nukes would be on the table  were they losing. 

Putin has a clear policy of ""escalate to de-escalate"" of which tactical nukes are a part. It's a part of saying - we're willing to go the entire way over this issue, are you? Which if Putin cannot mobilize, and is facing overwhelming NATO firepower he could very well be forced into.

MAD does not necessarily apply to tactical nukes.. the side that did a strategic strike in response would be the greatest war criminal state in history - and if NATO formally joined the war it's a signal of intent that more tactical nukes would be used, with only one likely final destination.

Basically it's a ""Win"" button that Putin can press at any time.. why do you doubt he would consider using it?

No, you don't seem to be capable of reading what I'm saying, or even addressing my points.

I understand that you *want* to believe that. But it's categorically untrue. As someone who remembers American news coverage of the Iraq War, the lies about WMDs, and people getting shouted down on TV for questioning whether the US government was lying or outright blacklisted, I can tell you that you are completely, 100%, incapable of understanding the bias implicit in corporate media in the West, and that's pretty sad.

I've already said that you shouldn't go to RT for information having to do with Russia. Are you not capable of understand this? Is your reading comprehension really *that* fucking bad?

Information from state media should be taken with a grain of salt, *particularly* when the news story in question is related to the state that is producing the media. But that's not the only standard for judging the relative merits of a specific news agency.

This isn't remotely difficult to understand.

No, it doesn't have *any* genuine integrity, or *any* rules of verification of information. That's a lie. Flat out. 100%. Go read the Daily Mail or watch Sky News and keep telling yourself such obviously moronic falsehoods, though.

Have you *tried* watching Newsmax or OANN? Try watching them for a day and come back to me and tell me that they're somehow better than RT was. They're not. They're worse. *Substantially* worse.

I do think MacArthur is usually brought up as an outlier with the more liberal use of nukes and the idea of it that stemmed from the end of WW2 so to me he's not at all indicative of the modern policy as compared to the post-WW2 period and the ensuing cold war. I've not seen any modern person echo his possible suggestion of bombing retardation targets along a border and similar uses and people only bring him up to say ""look at how fucking crazy we were back then"". That's what I meant with that MAD wasn't as developed at the time but I think we hold a different view on nukes today after we've lived under the threat so long.

Crimea was officially given to Ukraine and during its independence Russia didn't say shit. You can't just go ""hey, that piece of land is so culturally important to us it's literally part of our nation"" and we have a right to defend it even with nukes. I 100% believe it's super important to Putin but I think it's a stretch to consider it so firmly an integral part of Russia to the points of using nukes about it. 

Keep in mind the Russian doctrine isn't about an attack on the state of Russia but the “very existence of the state"". Obviously that can be interpreted in many different ways but I find it not very credible to tie that up to ""I'm Putin and I fucked up so fucking much and I'm literally Russia so I get to nuke anyone to get my agenda across because if I'm humiliated it's the end of the very existence of Russia as a state"". Not saying it's impossible for sure but combine that with breaking nuclear taboo it's very hard for me to see how it'd remotely be in Putin's interest because being stained by nuclear use would be pretty bad. It's NOT a ""win"" button for long term strategic goals. Why would he nuke Ukraine if it means ruining his reputation and of Russia for the foreseeable future? I think there's a reason Ukraine has been so messy because they wanted Crimea 2.0 and now they are stuck in a place where they have to be optimistic and stick out an awkward middle measure conquest attempt that might even fail. And yes, I think USA got away with it because it was new at the time and people didn't really understand its power + WW2 was really fucking brutal and terrible towards civilians in general which I don't think we really ""accept"" anymore.

Also the analysis you linked pretty much said what Perun said but it went into more detail about the different scenarios while ruling out the extreme ones as very unlikely but the TL;DR was that they'd either adopt extreme non-military actions or a strong conventional military response which again is what Perun said (unless I'm the dumb). Here's the relevant TL:DR backing that up.

>If Putin decides to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, it will represent an unparalleled level of barbarity and an eschewing of international norms. It will also present NATO and the United States with complicated policy options, all of which have potential global consequences. I have attempted to lay out a broad framework for potential policy responses. I argue that the two extremes, responding in kind and pushing for a settlement, are unwise given the escalatory risks or potential for establishing destructive and unstable patterns of behavior. The two other options—escalating conventionally against Russia or staying the course—each have their own risks and levels of uncertainty. **Except for bending to nuclear coercion, it is difficult to see how Russia’s use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine does not significantly raise the possibility of a conflict between Russia and NATO.**

So to clarify. I think there's a chance Putin could pull out nukes but it's hard not to see that as a very bad option for him and that there's a HUGE difference between using nukes as a soft threat and actually using them and ruining nuclear taboo. As I said previously, he'd lose pretty much all other allies on the global scale and give NATO a free card to go even deeper fucking them up in the long run and there's not really any good tactical targets for the nukes anyway to justify it.",False,1653153847.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9glbc2,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

You should always be aware of media bias. My contention was *never* that you *shouldn't.* My contention, as someone who consumes all sorts of different news media is that RT is objectively less biased than any of the major 24-7 cable news outlets in the US, and many other elsewhere, and you've said absolutely nothing to refute this aside from pointing to the fact that they're biased with respect to Russia... which... obviously, no shit, they are.

In the American example, Fox News is absolute horseshit and the reality that an arguable legitimate journalist like Chris Wallace might be at the station doesn't diminish or take away one bit that the whole channel is designed to push disinformation and false narratives at people.

I think the chance is there that he'll try to escalate with nuclear weapons and maybe Perun was a bit too flippant in writing it off but I still think his take was close to how I'd see it.

I have a hard time seeing him start pushing in the other direction and take it all down in spite and if he does I expect people around him to stop him. Again, the chance is there but to me it's so small it shouldn't be considered when doing policy / responses to Russia.

I'd love it if he took Hitlers route of just shooting himself in the head. Hitler didn't kill jews as a blind collateral done in a fit of anger and spite.

So to me, if Putin uses tactical nukes I fully expect Russia to instantly die or close to it and not by nukes but the worlds intervention to reset the norm to only defensive deterrence.

If NATO can save Ukraine, turn it into a good rolemodel for USA's intervention that opens up a precedent for how such intervention could look in the Pacific that would greatly aid their pivot there and influence cooperation.

I haven't seen anything to think Russia will easily bypass the sanctions and that China will provide all they need. Imports from China is down by like 45% or so. I do think they can get some and I heard they are starting up cold war ways to smuggle things in but that it might be slow to get going and not cover everything.

>Putin and the oligarchs looting the country actually also provide insulation.. the people never saw the wealth, and so are unaffected when it is taken away.

I don't think this is fully the case especially for the more prosperous cities. And we already know their military industry is struggling to get advanced components and entire supply chains of more mundane things are threatened.

>Inertia will mean this will drag on, rather than end.. just like every other forever war of the last 20 years. Sapping the strength of the west when it soon might be sorely needed.

USA has always been ready to fight two wars. Maybe I'm optimistic but I don't think Russia can keep this up for more than a year or two. I get that you don't think the sanctions will matter or that the shift from Russian oil and gas will come to fruition but I do.

So I still think this is a vital and important winnable fight but I do hope it's solved with as little bloodshed as possible. 

Anyway I'm off to sleep. Was fun talking with you! But if you send something else right now just don't expect a response until much later :)",False,1653173424.0,t3_uuf7ft,t1_i9hyznk,,6,2,0,2,0,0,
