Some key points:

- Russia is clearly preparing for a big offensive. The obvious directions are to try and take the Donetsk oblast or push back towards Kup'yansk in the Kharkiv oblast. There could be secondary strikes from Belarus or even across the Dnipro river in Kherson oblast, but those will most likely serve as a distraction to tie down Ukrainian troops.

- Any potential offensives both from Russian and Ukrainian sides will have to conclude by the end of March at the latest because that is when the spring mud season begins. After that the next window for offensive actions will open in June. Russia will very likely start something in the last week of January/first week of February with the intent of achieving some results by the 24 February, the 1 year anniversary of the war as they are obsessed with symbolic dates.

- Taras has just returned from the Soledar area and he says the battle for Soledar is far from over. At the moment Ukrainian artillery is a lot more active (he mentioned 10:1 ratio of outgoing Ukrainian shells to incoming Russian) and they are pounding the Wagner units stationed inside the town. He could also hear small arms fire and he says Ukrainians are doing quick skirmishes in an out of Soledar.

- A VDV unit has been surrounded and captured near Soledar and is being interrogated.

- Wagner seems to have little to no communication with the regular Russian army, they're acting on their own and they lack artillery support. They have some artillery of their own but it's scarce. They are clearly short on ammunition such as 82mm and 120mm mortar rounds, but it's difficult to say whether that's because the Russian army is struggling in general or because they are building up a reserve for the offensive.

- There is not much difference between Wagner and regular army in terms of tactics, it's just frontal assault with no regard for losses.",False,1674073315.0,t3_10exfmb,t3_10exfmb,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

 that the original invasion plans (landing at Gostomel, PMCs seige entrances of Kyiv, seizure of Odessa-to-Dniester via Transnistria) had been drawn up by Gerasimov.  He was livid last year that his plans had been so poorly executed, and almost none of his targeted seizures were captured. 

They reported that he’s been tasked by Putin to draw up new plans, but now he’s in charge of execution too, as others eff-up his plans. 

That goals have been whittled down to (1) demilitarization of Ukraine and (2) complete seizing the four partially-annexed territories. 

Towards these goals, Gerasimov‘s new plans involve tens of thousands of new troops, accumulated 70-80,00 thus far; that they’ve ‘starved’ deployed units and PMCs of ammunition, in order to stockpile for new campaign; and crucially, new plans finally involve “demilitarization,” which Gerasimov says requires taking or at least attacking western Ukraine in order to end the supply of western weapons, and thus there’s a large buildup of Russian troops in Western Belarus.",1674065416.0,1674065213.0,t3_10exfmb,t3_10exfmb,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

In Davos this afternoon, Olaf Scholz remained silent on the issue of Leopard tanks. However, according to consistent media reports, the Chancellor is prepared to allow the delivery of the battle tanks to Ukraine - but only under conditions.

According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Scholz made it clear in a telephone conversation with U.S. President Joe Biden that Germany could only deliver if the U.S. in turn provided Ukraine with Abrams tanks. Biden had apparently not yet made a commitment in the conversation.

The Bild newspaper also reported, citing government circles, that Scholz wants to allow German Leopard deliveries as well as Nato partners to do so - if the USA also provided Abrams tanks. According to the report, Scholz is concerned that Europe and the U.S. only give battle tanks to Ukraine together so that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot split NATO.

The Chancellor's Office would not comment on the reports.

Because let's face it, unlike artillery systems - tanks are meant to directly engage with enemy forces. There will be western Tanks that will be destroyed.

It appears to me that if Germany is going to put it's top tier Armored hardware on the line it wants the U.S. to do the same.

> In a telephone conversation with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday, Scholz made it clear that Germany could only give in to pressure to deliver if the U.S. in turn delivered Abrams main battle tanks.

>Scholz has always stressed that Germany would not go it alone in providing military support to Ukraine. Biden apparently did not commit himself during the talks. The U.S. is apparently demanding that the Chancellor's Office not only allow other countries to supply Leopard 2 main battle tanks if it participates in such a delivery, but also supply some itself.

Russia has stated in this war they have lost 80,000 troops. We know that the Ukrainians and NATO reporting have been a little more accurate. They claim ~117,000 losses. About 46% more. 

I wonder how they can continue also. A big reason for them leaving Afghanistan was the public not really liking being at war and losing. You bring up a good point in regards to the continuation. Let's say the Soviets actually lost 46% more than the 26k they had. Call it 50k to make it easy. That means the Russians are at over double the losses in under one year. Might break triple the amount of losses before the 24th of February year mark at that rate.

Notice how they didn't supply properly armed IFVs beforehand? Just M113 with a machine gun on top, maybe some old BMPs. Only (stationary) artillery, which enables Ukraine to hold their defensive line.

Now with the rumoured new mobilization wave, possible arms supplies from Iran, ongoing radicalization of russian population, dramatic situations like the Dnipro apartment bombing there is a western will to match the escalation.

Yes, because its explicitly not NATO vs Russia. It's Russia vs. Ukraine, with a bunch of Allies supporting Ukraine because Russia is a Terrorist State.

If Russia wanted to take on NATO, they could attack Poland whenever they want. Easy peasy. There's a reason they haven't.

Its all political theater. They must need the narrative for their own populace or else they wouldn't bother. It's certainly not because of some lame attempt to convince other countries whose leaders and organizations can easily see through such a narrative.

One thing has become evident is that the advertised brochure of Russia's weapon systems is not at all what was being produced. I doubt they have *working and reliable* newer weapons systems. They already threw their BMP-T's into the fray. They've thrown their T-90's. The T-15 is still in a prototype phase and likely of no use in a combat environment (I imagine one reason is the anti-missile system probably doesn't work, so it'd be fed to a Javelin so quick). The SU-57's, if they were used (rumored), do so from a standoff distance because they're about as stealthy as my uncle sneaking in from the bar.

This is incorrect.

The GLSDB is a MLRS rocket attached to a GBU-39.

The GBU-39 itself weighs 280 pounds (127kg) and is a glide bomb. The warhead varies from 36 pounds (16kg) to a whopping 130 pounds ( 60kg).

Whether the border guards and territorial defense has any actual combat experience; whether the swamps present an actual defense or whether that’s a false belief and RF already has a remedy to overcome; whether adequately equipped to ward off an invasion or was their equipment and ammunition redirected to current frontlines; whether the swamps and rivers are mined; how many Russians and Belarusians are across the border; whether recon groups are penetrating border; whats the current protocol for firing cross border (only Russia? Or also Belarus?) and if can target, under what conditions and whether it matters that need to limit target to ensure only hit Russians. 

My take-aways is that Ukraine is not securing that area as much as it could, bc partially relying on terrain to be a defense. It also only has border guards and territorial defense—no armed forces—however essentially all are rotated and have already fought alongside armed forces farther east.  They are not completely ill-prepared, as another invasion is possible, however it’s not disclosed how well prepared they actually are.  Russia intends to exploit what they think are weaknesses here.  It’s unclear whether Russia has an accurate picture of Ukraine’s forces and capabilities in the region.

Also something not really mentioned directly—the level of support (hidden traitors) in the region. One article I read which focused on a border town said that until covid, they had Belarusians coming in to dine at their town’s restaurants every day.  That even pedestrians crossed daily.  That the local farmers in that rural area of Ukraine/Belarus often crossed borders, like to buy local goods, pick berries, as it had always been visa-free crossing allowed.  (Basically an open border.)  That it was very common to have a grandparent or grandchild across the border, to send children to spend summer across the border, that even local territorial defense and police officers had a grandparent or uncle or sibling across the border. 

This can pose a risk—cause divided loyalties, exploit people ties.  This is another angle that Russia will be trying to exploit, likely via naive Belarusians.",False,1674086647.0,t3_10exfmb,t1_j4w9nv4,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

This is incorrect.  

Look up the Golan Heights in the first 2 days of the Yom Kippur war for an example.  

Tanks are particularly brutal when they can park in defilade and/or have a series of ditches that they drive into.

There are reports that Putin refuses to field his best aircraft for fear of having them shot down. Not only is this a loss of a valuable expensive asset, but it also brings into question how viable it is as a modern combat weapon, and if it has difficulty performing, exports of their jets could also be expected to drop. 

Why would Germany be different? The Brits have way fewer Challengers in their own army much less being sold globally. The french “tanks” sent aren’t really MBTs like the leopards are. And there have been 3600 Leopard 2s built. If GER decides to send tanks, Rheinmetall has said the required changes to the Leopards that would be sent to Ukraine means they wont be battle ready until 2024. If that’s true, then that means fielding leopards now could be a disaster for the brand that is the Leopard and a potential mark on the german defence industry. 16 or so countries have purchased  Leopards. And to have a sudden embarrassment in a “peer to peer” conflict against the current state of the Russian military is one I don’t think the Leopards could survive. 

In that light, it makes sense to be asking for the Americans to also send tanks, because at least they would have the safety of a behemoth of a weapons platform also pushing the scales of the battlefield in their favour. In the worst case, if any Abrams goes down, the Germans can save face and say that even the American MBTs have issues in the modern battlefield.

Not quite true for everything. Take Leo2s as an example: 

While Germany has the money and the technology, they lack the production capabilities. During 'peace times' the military industry has their production scaled to be able to fulfill smaller (small as in: we need 200 tanks over the next 15 years or something) contracts with nations not in conflict. The companies are not state owned, they need to operate fiscally responsible and can't keep giant production and spare parts capabilites just in case a major war breaks out next door.

But unfortunately that's what we're currently seeing. There's no way, that the MIC can scale up production without there being proper contracts to supply more goods in place with governments. This takes a lot of money and time.

Without having deeper knowledge for the spare part procurement of Leopard 2 parts, I'd expect a lot of the parts to be sourced from small/medium enterprises who deliver very specialized parts in very small amounts. These need to be upscaled in unison.

>I've seen it in military books.

Explain the difference between these two statements. Other than irony. My only reason for reference the map was to show the sheer distance between the two points. Pick any map ya like.

I never said Ukraine has ""no"" reserves, just not significant enough that there are tanks just hanging out having a good time back at Kyiv. We can't pretend that Ukraine is sitting on a lot of reserves when their soldiers in Bakhmut and Soledar were screaming for reinforcements, but told no because material was needed at Kreminna, etc.

I just don't see the purpose of an overweight tank being sent to Ukraine so it can get absolutely bogged down in the mud or destroy Ukraine's own roads and bridges.

Again, there's an irony in so many on social media declaring ""Just give Ukraine X weapon system or Y vehicle"" to the point of fixation, assuming they know more than the defense departments of western nations in contact with Ukraine's military intel.",1674058173.0,1674057809.0,t3_10exfmb,t1_j4vftq5,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Not sure why the attitude but it should be clear books written by military people and redditors looking at maps is not the same thing.

Also, you could have just said you don't want ""heavy"" tanks to be sent to UA or whatever your goalpost moving is now.",False,1674059121.0,t3_10exfmb,t1_j4vmi3h,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

It was someone suggesting we send abrams to defend Kyiv to ""fix the gas guzzling"" and logistical hurdles of it.

>it should be clear books written by military people and redditors looking at maps is not the same thing.

Given the amount of pop history out there, it's very easy for these two things to be the same. ""Written by military people"" doesn't make things infallible. Everyone has an agenda. See: pervasive amount of historical revisionism and myth disguised as history about the ""superior German tanks"" or Russian red army doctrine in WW2.",False,1674059288.0,t3_10exfmb,t1_j4vpzad,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
