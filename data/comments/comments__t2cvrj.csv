Russia does not have some super special reserve of super awesome troops it's gonna send in a day or two after the pleb Russians are done getting killed. Russia's army is barely keeping up with first world countries, it's airforce is about to be left in the dust of 5th generation planes and don't have a ton of pilots to begin with, and their Navy is not made to fight a full naval war.

The past three decades have been brutal on the Russian military. They went from a bankrupt, failed communist state to a barely functional oligarchy who's top leaders are bleeding the country dry.

Even if you try to portray the Army as useless, untrained conscripts; the same cannot be said for paratroopers, tankers, and fighter pilots. They tanks tons of training to use their equipment correctly. 


You cannot take a rando off the street, throw him in a SU-30 and expect him to get it off the ground. You can't take four guys hanging out in bar and put them in a T-90 and expect them to be able to engage enemy units at a mile away. You can't take a hobo off a back alley, strap a parachute on him, drop him behind enemy lines, and expect him to hold an airfield.

Russia's military just isn't what it was 50+ years ago. Decades of poor funding, poor training conditions, and lack of actual combat experience have left it a shadow of itself. In lue of all of those Russia has opted for a propaganda stance to push the idea that their fighting force is the best in the world and that every Russian soldier is an awesome badass ready to do back flips and throw ninja stars.

So let's get this absolutely clear. Russia is not dropping some super awesome troops they've been withholding. Their equipment are a mix of late cold war, early post war era weapons that have been upgraded and are near the end of their sell by dates. Their advantage is numbers and after Ukraine they might not even have that going for them.",False,1645926847.0,t3_t2cvrj,t3_t2cvrj,,0,161,0,161,0,0,

We are receiving more confirmation of a blaze at an oil terminal in the Ukrainian town of Vasylkiv, southwest of the capital, Kyiv.

The town’s mayor, Natalia Balasinovich, said Russian missiles hit the oil storage area southwest of the air base’s main runway in a video posted online. The National News Agency of Ukraine later confirmed the reports.

Photographs and video posted online showed large flames rising under the night sky.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said on Telegram.

The missile attack was carried out on the Vasilkovskaya oil depot of the KLO company. Rescuers have already left for the scene of the tragedy. Most likely, there were no casualties. It will burn for a long time. The environmental damage will be colossal.”

The mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasinovich, also confirmed that rockets hit the oil depot in Vasilkov, and a strong fire started.

A natural gas pipeline was also blown up in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, after a Russian attack, the Ukrainian state service of special communications said.

A mushroom-shaped explosion was shown in a video it posted on the Telegram messaging app.

It was not immediately clear how important the pipeline was and whether the blast could disrupt gas shipments outside the city or the country.

US tanks do not run out of fuel and get abandoned with the frequency we've seen with the Russians, and the Russians' demonstrated sustainment game at this point is inferior to what we've seen from the USA. Yes, we are days into this conflict. But I'm not sure Russia can sustain a protracted conflict. Russians (assuming they exist in sufficient numbers today to willingly go forth into a meatgrinder) still need fuel to get to the battlefield, food to eat along the way, ammunition to shoot, etc, etc, and so far, Moscow seems to be handling this with all the planning and sustainment of a beer run.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ. ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ. ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО! ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

>**26/Otherwise, becuase what remains of your force is split in small groups moving on main roads, UA can mobilize via back roads and just recapture most of the towns as you have few troops for actual 24/7 duties and to even spot them moving back into the town.**

>**27/Can it work? I don't know. Is it a good plan. Hell no. Could they execute anything else, without the entire structure confessing the army has corruption,which  yes the boss expected, but it's such a rot it might cost him his throne? yeah not when he's in this mood.**

>  
>That’s according to Credit Suisse Group AG offshore strategist Zoltan Pozsar, who parsed data from the Bank of Russia and financial markets to calculate that a much larger share is held in dollars than official numbers suggest. The Bank of Russia’s dollar exposure is about 50%, compared with the 20% it reports, Credit Suisse estimates.

>“$300 billion -– in the extreme -– can either be potentially trapped by sanctions, or moved somehow from West to East to avoid being trapped by sanctions,” Pozsar wrote in a report Thursday.  
>  
>Russia’s central bank and private sector have almost $1 trillion of liquid wealth, with dollars accounting for more than most people realize, even after the country sold all its Treasuries holdings in 2018, Pozsar wrote. He estimates about $200 billion is held in foreign-exchange swaps, with another $100 billion in deposits at foreign banks.

For one, fighting in Ukraine is still going on I’m tired of people saying “oh it’s been quiet for a while” and acting like it’s done. In a conflict there are moments of high intensity and low intensity, Russia probably is regrouping to an extent because they have take some losses. As for Putin at home, the protests in Russia have already died down a lot, that’s not to say that people aren’t mad still, but they have seen what has happened to people who have protested, and as for the oligarchs, I think you guys are massively underestimating how much balls it takes to go against a dictator and overestimating the chances it will actually happen, the chances of it happening can go up and I think they will as the economic situation gets more desperate but still I would not get my hopes up.

The only reason Ukraine is still standing is because their country’s majority is white and they don’t have a Muslim majority in the country. Russia leveled Grozny and those were Chechens with decades of fierce fighting experience. Russia leveled buildings in Syria and indiscriminately bombed buildings. This too was against Islamic fundamentalists with fierce fighting experience. This is all too say that when Russia has fought in recent wars, their tactic is to use overwhelming military force against their enemies while indiscriminately killing civilians in the process. It’s a lot harder to do that against a nation state with virtually no ties to terrorism like in Syria or Chechnya. As much as people get uncomfortable with the implications, being a European country with internationally recognized statehood is the difference maker here. I’m also not dismissing the tragic civilian casualties so far in Ukraine. But it is less than in Russia’s previous conflicts. Ukraine’s position in the world limits the amount of damage that Putin can do. Kyiv is not Grozny. Because of this, Kyiv may actually hold out a lot longer than estimates of Western Intelligence. Putin knows he can’t level Kyiv like he’s done to other cities in the past.

NATO membership would have shielded Ukraine from Russia, while further boxing Russia in.  EU membership probably boosts the Ukrainian economy massively over time while economic ties with Russia would relax.

I'm not part of the IC but through my own work and a few friends I got a pretty good survey today of takes from academics who study modern Russia and often advise NATO militaries on the topic, who are familair with the IC's current thoughts. The atmosphere is one of sheer bewilderment. Nobody understands why this has gone so poorly, and what the long terms goals are.

For the record, exactly zero of the knowledgeable people I've talked to think there is some sinister genius Russian plan. I've heard these folks praise Putin as a genius time and time again for years now. There is near 100% agreement that he's stepped on a rake.

Leading theory is, as in this thread, that Russian command took their own propaganda too seriously. Belief was that the UA would fold that that Ukranians would naturally accept Russia once they were ""freed."" Now they've got to fight a war against people who don't want them there and they are 0% prepared for that.

There may be victory yet for Russia, at least tactically. But the Russian Army has been revealed to be a paper tiger and Putin, despite all his puffing, has actually been outmaneuvered by the Ukranian equivalent of Jon Stewart.

How many people or entities that want to trade their currency for another national currency determines the demand for that currency, and hence its price compared to USD.

With sanctions on Russia, no one wants the Rouble, so its price will plunge already. Entities currently holding any Roubles would want to trade it for another currency (aka USD because reason above) to avoid having the value of their holdings get wrecked.

With Russian USD assets frozen, Russia can't buy the Rouble off these people, making these Roubles absolutely worthless, because no one, including Russia can buy them or trade them for anything.

This absolute worthlessness of significant quantities of Roubles weakens the confidence in the currency even further, encouraging everyone else to dump the Rouble and compete with each other to get at the remaining 61% of unfrozen foreign reserve before that runs out too.

There are plenty of reasons for that, but the main one is the price of rouble directly linked to its demand. Why someone needs to buy roubles? Because he needs them to make payments to Russian companies or to pay Russian taxes, he needs money to spend them in Russia. With all the new sanctions the demand would be lower, because some deals will be forbidden.

So, demand is low, price is low. A week ago you could get 70 roubles for a dollar, on Monday it could be 100, 120 or 180.

And it works vice versa also. To buy something from the west Russian companies need dollars. But there will be less sellers than usual (because no one wants to buy roubles), so dollar will go higher.

In the past these problems could be somehow solved by central bank. If there was a lack of dollars on the market (for any reason), central bank could sell dollars from its own reserves to save the current rouble value or to make its fall less painful for all the participants, to make it slower.

But there is no guarantee central bank will/can do this on Monday because some of his assets are frozen and he needs to be very mindful about spending dollars.

Thus, catastrophe.

That's a huge deal, especially for Russia, whose economy basically exists because of its export of fossil fuels. 

Not being able to trade/invest on the international markets will devalue the Ruble by quite a bit. Now, normally, the central bank of a country would use its reserves to regulate its currency in case of a decline in value, but with a lot of its reserves frozen, the central bank of Russia can't do that in any meaningful way, so when markets open on Monday and the stock markets and the Ruble takes a massive beating(which it will), the central bank will be effectively powerless to do anything about it.

* How did 13 border guards turn into 82?
* Why would the ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself"" soldiers surrender willingly? They knew what they were condemning themselves to death when they denied surrender.
* One of the soldiers livestreamed up until the moment the warship opened fire and the stream cuts out.
* How did none of these guards suffer severe injuries or even death given that the above is true and that snake island is tiny?
* Why has the particular soldier not gone live to assure his followers that he is indeed alive?
* If they are alive, would Russia not be plastering their faces all over news networks getting them to recite their vow to not take up arms? That is extremely compelling propaganda going to waste. 
* We are to believe this is true when the same outlet continously pushes claims that Ukraine is full of neo-nazis commiting ethnic cleansing?

Tanks in urban warfare are a different beast than in the open. It can work but it takes a high level of coordination and cooperation with infantry forces. Russia knows this from lessons learned in Grozny yet they are making the same mistakes. Additionally, this is the first time modern ATGM's have been so concentrated on the battlefield once again proving their worth. It would be easy for Russia to level their objectives with massed fires but they have refrained from doing so, likely because they want the infrastructure intact and are trying to limit casualties.

Secondly, airborne operations are generally done under a blanket 
of air superiority and Russia still hasnt achieved it but they keep trying drops. If the numbers are correct, they've lost almost 1000 paratroopers in the IL-76 shoot downs alone.

It would take an incredible amount of time and resources for them to set up an equivalent of the Iron Dome (which is really just tons-and-tons of conventional CWIS, AA batteries, and patriot missile systems. Yes, largely US-made).

But ultimately, that wouldn't be too useful to Ukrainians because they can't defend static-defenses in this war frankly. I'd imagine that the Russians would have blown up any such static ""iron dome"" if it were in Ukraine. The ""stingers"" and ""javelins"" just make more sense in the given situation.

A 50-lb missile launcher that can kill airplanes, helicopters, and tanks is much much better than a 5-ton CWIS that shoots 3000 rounds of ammo per minute. You can't move the 5-ton CWIS very far in these circumstances, but the 50lb missile launcher can be carried by hand by commandos (or worst case, militia / partisans / insurgency if the military collapses).

The CWIS probably would have run out of ammo on the 1st night anyway and now be a useless piece of junk / white elephant.",1645929271.0,1645928503.0,t3_t2cvrj,t1_hyldi4m,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

The general rule is if attacking a fortified/defended position, you will need at least 3:1 in your attacking force, never mind the sustainment those forces would require by themselves. These numbers historically came from studies that came out of WWII and subsequent conflicts. That is just in manpower. 

There are old publicly available US Army manuals, namely FM 101-10 that are now out of date and released to the public easily available that outline logistical requirements for operations. One of the largest obviously is food, water, fuel, and munitions support. Let’s do a hypothetical.   

You are an attacking force fighting against a fortified position of 1000. You would generally need 3000 fighting soldiers to take that position. Typically, 1 to attack the defender in  the initial who is likely wounded or killed. A second to continue fighting that defending individual, while a 3rd conducts movement to go in for the kill or to remain in reserve for further push.

No real need to though. If you train the first few batches of Ukranian soldiers on the hardware well enough, they can train the rest.

So far as weapons go - I have no idea if we're still sending more over. The UK has a huge weapons industry, but it still takes time to ramp up production and we need to keep enough back for our own army if needed. Might be that we sent what we could already until production catches back up.

Assuming we are still sending hardware, it'll be tricky without a land border. We're not part of the EU anymore which makes shipping things into Europe difficult, and we can't just fly things into an active warzone without it being very obvious and very dangerous.

The people there voted for it (even if rigged, there is no evidence most of the people there didn't want to join Russia).  It was handed to Ukraine in a symbolic gesture in the 50s, at a time where the distinction between Russia and Ukraine was non-existant.  And in modern times, it \*is\* Russia's only warm water port attached to the mainland.

Yeah, it sucked for Ukraine, and in retrospect, was a harbinger of things to come.  At the time, Hillary Clinton had some interview (which I've been wanting to show to a Russian friend to win an argument, but cannot find - if you have a link i'll send you .01 eth lol), where she basically said ""Crimea is one thing; Eastern Europe is another""... and I agree.

I honestly think the west could have swallowed that one over time... or at least treated it like a Taiwan situation, where we spend 50-100 years saying it belongs to one side while doing nothing to change the status quo.

However, to your greater point - Russians as a culture do seem more susceptible to misinformation than most, and have a habit of not really questioning authority.  It makes sense... there has never really been a 'free' Russia, whether it was the Tsars, the Soviet Union, the ""wild west"" lawlessness in the 90s, and now in a semi-fascist state under Putin.  It kind of makes sense they'd suck at second guessing leaders.

Really, the only ones who can stop this shit and bring Russia into the modern world are Russians.  Its been done in short bursts (standing up to the KGB during their attempt to restore the USSR in 91 as it all came apart comes to mind), and perhaps the thought of being complicit in slaughtering their slavic brothers will bring it out now.

In most (really all) high explosives, the oxidizer is part of the explosive mix. You can think of it like gunpowder in a bullet in a sealed gun chamber (not a high explosive, but similar). There's no way for oxygen in the air to get in fast enough (or in a gun, at all) to sustain the speed of the reaction, so it has to bring its own.

In a thermobaric or fuel-air bomb, the payload is almost entirely fuel/explosive/energetic compound. It uses a small burster payload which explodes and creates a cloud of mist or fine particles (imagine a fire cracker in a bag of flour). A moment later that cloud is set off, and because all the particles are now surrounded by air/oxygen, they can use that to sustain the explosive reaction. The biggest advantage of this is that such explosions have a different sort of blast wave than traditional high explosives. High explosives tend to be very ""peaky"", with a lot of energy over a very short period of time. Thermobarics have lower peaks but longer duration. This can be useful when you want to ""shove"" something, like taking down heavy structures. Imagine it like a heavy punching bag; a punch had more peak force, but a shoulder shove has longer duration if you want to get it swinging. Also, longer duration blasts tend to ""bend"" around corners better. For high blast, you can escape many of the effects by being in the ""shadow"" of an object, like in a trench or behind a solid wall. Lower but longer duration blasts can fill in that space, injuring/killing people behind cover. That's why they are often used against trench lines or cave complexes.",1645929440.0,1645929160.0,t3_t2cvrj,t1_hylcpkb,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

A thermobaric bomb however doesn't have an oxidizer and instead relies solely on atmospheric oxygen. They operate by having a small conventional bomb in the center to scatter and mix the fuel with the surrounding atmosphere and once enough oxygen has been mixed in a second charge ignites the mixture.

The way Putin took Crimea was very different than what is going on here. Russia will be punished and held accountable for the destruction they have already caused.

Basically the general staff assumed that they really were going in to topple a deeply unpopular government and would largely be conducting a policing/occupation campaign once resistance at the border was subdued and breakthroughs were achieved.

Makes sense when you look at how this has played out so far: no initial 'shock and awe' campaign to soften up defenses, eliminate heavy assets, and degrade C&C networks, very limited EW application despite Russian capabilities in this area, unsupported light troops being dropped on key objectives far from heavy ground mobile assets, limited action inside of cities, and extremely poor protection of their logistics net. They took massive gambles underpinned by the assumption that Ukraine lacked the resolve to fight.

Would have paid massive dividends if they had been correct. A successful rapid strike to eliminate Ukraine's government and install their own while limiting casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure would have helped check resentment among the population (useful if you want to prevent widespread insurgency) and preserved much of the nation's existing assets, limiting the need for investment to keep the new puppet state functional.

My issue is more with how twisted the morals of the situation are.

I was born, grew up, and lived the first 20 years of my life about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, and I still have several family members who live literally within a mile of it, but because we are on the ""right"" side of said border, we're safe - my country is a NATO-member. Apparently that's the difference: on this side of the corn field, my life, my freedom is worth risking a nuclear war for, on the other side, it wouldn't be. I have a hard time accepting that. I imagine it would be even harder if I was on the other side.

We're watching the destruction of a modern, democratic, civilized, European country on live TV while arguing about who should condemn what, and in the meantime, we're putting an awful lot of hope into an unhinged Putin not launching those nukes anyway for whatever reason, essentially hoping that either Ukraine beats him back by some miracle, or that he'll calm down and eventually die of old age if we let him have his blitzkrieg now.

I know I'm oversimplifying this, but as long as Putin is the supreme leader of Russia, the threat of nuclear strikes will exist and it will be high, regardless of what anyone else does.  
I don't know what the right answer is, but I'm not sure I even want to live in a world that broadcasts the public execution of Zelensky and his family, and nobody is willing to do anything meaningful about it because Putin holds the world hostage with his nukes.

Just chill. Putin thought he'd meet no resistance or severe sanctions, his own oligarchs are preparing a really bad spanking for him, he can't be more agressive because it means more sanctions and more angry oligarchs and he can't be less aggressive because they are progressing waaaayyy slower that expected. You know what happened to Sadam Hussein when he became too much of a threat? To Epstein? When enough people fear-hate you, life becomes seriously unsafe.

I think it's gonna be Afganistan 2, where a big country tried to have things their way, wasted billions, had to leave, things went back to how it was before war in a few weeks. Having occupied territories is like having a bleeding wound  - it never stops to be a problem.

Some leaders think ""I have more tanks, more people, I'll go take that country"". Nah, that's not gonna happen. I'm from Lithuania, Russia tried so hard, so many times to make us part of Russia. But apparently money and soldiers and tanks are not enough, if no-one in Ukraine is going to give up, Putin will have to give up. Like USA had before. Like Russia had before. There's no amount of rubles or tanks or soldiers in the universe that can turn Ukrainians into Russians or Ukraine into part of Russia.

Putin's plan was:

*Take Kyiv fast

*Get no serious sanctions (Nordstream, Swift)

*Damage to economy not too bad, no angry oligarchs 

*Other countries not sending weapons to Ukraine

China is probably (wisely) keeping out of this for now. At least publicly. Biden making the decision to declassify an unprecedented level of detail about Putin’s plans pre-invasion did a LOT to dismantle Putin’s justification for war. Whether many in the West believed it or not, had his false flag operations worked out, Russian would not look quite as, well just straight up evil as they do now. Biden blew all that up and ensured that Putin had absolutely NO believable justification for the invasion of the entire country. I think he caught Putin off guard by doing this and Putin made a huge mistake by moving forward with his invasion of the entire country rather than just the newly declared separatist zones.

If you’re asking why China isn’t coming to Russia’s defense in any way, this probably has a LOT to do with it. On the other hand, if you’re asking why China isn’t speaking out AGAINST Putin, well that’s because they don’t typically involve themselves in European affairs like this where they can avoid it. Not to mention, China has been extremely open about their own desires invade/annex a few smaller countries near them. Taiwan being the main one and those disputed islands in the South China Sea.

As you’ve seen it’s taken a few days to get a consensus on how countries want to respond. It seems fairly likely Tsar Putin was pretty much hoping to have the Ukrainian gov deposed before that could really happen. 

They did want to invade and take over, but probably not to occupy in the traditional sense - very fast war, eliminate the pro Europe gov, install a pro Russian one, remove 90% of forces and say you’re just there to protect the new gov during a transition. So a puppet state basically. 

Trouble is their plan was pretty stupid and seems to have been the classic russian ‘to turn off a mincer, just throw your men into it until it jams’ tactic, which wasn’t great 70 years ago and is worse today. 

Ideally they would have followed modern warfare tactics of spending probably weeks cutting off Ukraine, getting air superiority, softening up military targets before even crossing the border. But they couldn’t do that because it’s an illegal war, they couldn’t go to the UN get everyone else to agree and take their time.

Now they’re having to fall back onto plan B or C, adapt to a longer term war.

1. The state of the world right now is absolutely awful and people are sort of hyper vigilant about things lately with covid, trump/the insurrection, and a lot of other conflicts that have been happening in the world in such quick succession

2. I also think its the fact that a lot of us were pretty young when 9/11 happened, now we are older and more involved in politics and activism.  (It seems like every generation seems to be more involved in those things, and environmental conservation, etc.  not sure if it’s because of the internet or better education or something else)

3. It probably also has to do with the countries involved.  We are constantly told that Russia is the bad guy, in video games, movies, and real life.  There’s the USSR, world wars, the cold war, spies, the space race, etc.  I think as far as the middle east is concerned, we still get that quite a bit but nowhere near as much as, say russia or germany.

All available intelligence suggests that the Russian army is allocating their best personnel and equipment to the battle for Kyiv, and that they are having massive supply chain issues at the frontlines. Contrary to what Russian propaganda likes to insist, the Russian army is a second-rate military force using outdated equipment and ineffective soviet-era military doctrine. The Russian army has enormous issues with communication, ammunition, fuel, and food supplies. Even Kharkiv, which lies basically right on the border with Russia, remains under Ukrainian control (as of the time of me writing this). The Russian army appears to have unilaterally failed to meet their strategic goals, and so far the invasion has been an unmitigated tactical and strategic disaster.

The Russian army and economy absolutely does not have the resources to capture all of Ukraine, let alone invade further into Europe. Even if they did have the capabilities to do so, it would be a suicide mission for Putin. All countries (with the exception of Moldova) bordering Ukraine are NATO member states, and an invasion of any one of them would invoke the full combined military force of NATO.

Yeah, but Syria ? Ethiopia ? or an issue in which the West especially is complicit and of which we all will be victim: Climate Change ?

Bystanders to the conflict (myself included) have a chance to reflect on where they lie on the fault-lines of good and evil in this world. In many cases, it's complex or abstract if not ambiguous. I've had several conversations with people who say, ""Ukraine? or but it's corrupt. They had it coming!"" But where's the justice? Is violence *necessary*?

On a broader scale, I'm noticing that sometimes we call tragedies inevitable when we are at the same time complicit in them. We ought to speak and act in good faith.

> If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?

If not, could some ambitious general/admiral try seizing power? Would there be Putin loyalist factions who resist the new regime? 

It's a real slippery slope from regime change to internal power struggle to civil war, and if the Kremlin suddenly lost power, there's no way to know who would control countless nuclear, chemical, biological weapons, ballistic missiles, weapons, etc. No way to track, no way to control. 

Instead of being able to count the world's nuclear powers with your fingers, we'd be in a world with *dozens* of nuclear powers. Terrorists with chemical weapons programs. Crime syndicates with ICBMs.

The failure of Russian forces to decisively capture Kyiv quickly means they got more arms and non-lethal support in the last 24 hours than in the years running up to the invasion. Also, holding out this long is somewhat of a surprise given most of the initial planning and support was geared towards outfitting this insurrection.^* This apparently included starching quantities of shoulder-mounted rockets (javelins & stingers) in location in anticipation of that event. Much of Ukraines landscape (to the East)  of open plains and farmland does not lend itself to use of even the new longer range javelins from support positions, but that is a different story as Russian forces enter the surrounding suburbs and city.

>^* General Milley [Joint Chiefs of Staff - late December] did not detail to General Gerasimov the planning underway in Washington to support an insurgency, a so-called “porcupine strategy” to make invading Ukraine hard for the Russians to swallow. That includes the advance positioning of arms for Ukrainian insurgents, including Stinger antiaircraft missiles, that could be used against Russian forces.

>But a swift victory would be followed, General Milley told Gen. Valery Gerasimov, by a bloody insurgency, similar to the one that led the Soviet Union to leave Afghanistan in 1989, according to officials familiar with the discussion.

Ukraine has large amounts of oil and natural gas that was discovered back in 2012,  enough to make it the 12th largest petrol-state in the world. While it was aligned with Russia that was less concerning, Putin could ensure extraction was never properly developed and Russia's status as all of Europe's gas station (and the billions in cash it provided for he, Russia and his cronies) would remain intact.

Then Ukraine had a revolution that put a pro-western government in charge. Suddenly 40% of the entire government's budget was in danger. If Ukraine joined the EU, they'd have better trade agreements and a overall more favorable trade partner compared to Putin and his ilk. Russia would basically go bankrupt, that was the only outcome. Western companies such as Shell were already signing contracts to begin extraction and it looked like the pro-western Ukraine was about to strike it rich at the expense of Russia.

So they seized Crimea, and in the process took all the offshore oil and natural gas surrounding it (80% of Ukraine's total supply) along with all the billions in extraction equipment Ukraine had.

If you look at the two Russian backed separatist regions, they are coincidentally, SUPER close to the remaining oil and natural gas supply Ukraine has. Putin wanted to eliminate any possibility that Europe could go elsewhere for its energy needs.

He also had an issue with demographics. Russia has been in population decline for decades, and they were SERIOUSLY hurt by COVID. For the foreseeable future, Russia's population is going to continue to shrink and its pool of military aged males will decline. So he decided it was better to try and deal with Ukraine now when they are at their strongest, then wait and have their military wither.

Putin was desperate and scared, and this was his hail Mary attempt at keeping Russia and NOT Ukraine as Europe's energy provider. He didn't think Ukraine would last a single day and he didn't think the west would rally in solidarity. He fucked up on both counts and his days are absolutely numbered.

Thermobaric explosions take up much more volume and rely on adiabatic changes in pressure. (Thermodynamics was a long time ago for me, please forgive any mistakes!)

It also seems like the conventional shockwave will travel farther along a line of sight but be more susceptible to obstructions, whereas the thermobaric one will move around them but be less ""intense"", since it's a longer-wavelength fluctuation.

It’s been proven as fact that Trump has consistently praised Putin (Eg saying he trusted Putin over US intelligence), and other dictators/authoritarians (Eg Kim)

It’s been proven that Trump actively sought to weaken NATO, and even pursued trying to pull the US out of NATO. 

It’s been proven that Trump, just days ago, came out in support of Putin’s “genius” and praising his “peace keeping force”

Again, none of that is claiming that Trump is directly an Agent of Putin’s, but he’s clearly advanced Putin’s agenda nonetheless. 

But that’s not even what I was taking about. My point is not that Trump is on Putin’s side (though he has said he is). My point is that Trump wants to be just like Putin, and Kim, and Orban, etc. Trump wants to be an autocrat just like them. 

It’s been proven that he tried to cheat his way out of an election, even suggesting postponing the election due to the COVID situation. 

It’s been proven that he tells the same kid of bald faced lies that Putin and Kim and other autocrats do - Eg, “the election was stolen” 

It’s been proven that Trump invited his brainwashed MAGA supporters to stage an insurrection on his behalf, trying to overthrow a democratic government and install himself as autocratic ruler. 

In short, Putin is everything Trump wants to be - truly powerful and truly wealthy. We cannot ignore that reality and turned a blind eye to Trump and his Republicans pursuing their repeated attacks on democracy in the US.

Anti-government extremists frequently say they will fight in defense of the Constitution, and they see support for their position in Article I, section 8: the “militia” is the instrument designated “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.” The army receives less attention in the Constitution, although the president is designated as “Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States” (II, section 2). Still, fears of a standing army resulted in the limitation that funds to support an army could only be authorized for two years at a time (I, 8).  
Yet the Framers, still very much intact as a group, passed the Militia Acts of 1791 and 1792. These referred to organized militias approved and managed by the states, to be made up of all white males between the ages of 18 and 45.  
Later expanded beyond its original racist lines, the militia finally became thoroughly regularized in the Militia Act of 1903, also known as the Dick Act, after its sponsor Congressman Charles Dick. This law aimed to resolve the lack of clarity in the Constitution over who controlled the militia, the federal government or the states. Even though the Constitution authorized the president to call up the states’ militias in an emergency, with the agreement of a single Supreme Court justice–as happened in the Whiskey Rebellion—governors continued to resist such orders. The federal government had to supplement the regular army with volunteer militia units, including Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, as late as the Spanish-American War. The Dick Act created the National Guard to resolve the question, once again in favor of the central government. From 1903 on, the Guard has been both an internal security force and an additional reserve, as a national militia organized on a state-by-state basis, for the Army.  
That is what became of the Constitution’s militia. No armed “body of the people,” a phrase often used by the Framers, exists today. Self-proclaimed “militias” have no basis in the Constitution.",False,1645931546.0,t3_t2cvrj,t1_hyljbpc,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
