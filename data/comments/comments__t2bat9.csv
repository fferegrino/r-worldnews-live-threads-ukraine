1. Russia didn't plan for a real war and didn't expect resistance.
2. Putin doesn't care about sanctions.
3. Russia does not have the $$ set aside to fight for more than a few days.It's costing them several billions a day. Hence why they didn't deploy theremaining 2/3 of the army, they can't afford the fuel or ammo.
4. Russian army is kinda boned, they didn't expect full scale war and didn't stock up on enough missiles and rockets. They have expended a significant number of them and are rationing them (probably Iskander and Kaliber).
5. Russian factories can't replenish their stocks of advanced munitions for several more months as raw materials needed come from Europe and their now cut off.
6. Russian military industrial complex has plenty of small arms and conventional munitions.
7. Alpha Group and other special forces infiltrated into area near Kyiv a week before the fighting started, but their few in number so their plan is to sow panic with infiltration and essentially terrorist attacks to hope the Zelensky government will panic or resistance will crumble.
8. My Take: Ukrainians have recovered info from captured Russians that infiltrated or attempted to YOLO in Kyiv and it's a mix of elite special forces and paramilitary OMON units. Russians are failing to provide good armored support and enough manpower for special forces to assist in the capture of Kyiv. Their literally sending in paramilitaries with tanks and IFVs but OMON don't exactly know how to support tanks in retaking a city. They train to fight insurgents in the Caucasus. Jihadi's don't exactly have hunter killer teams with Javelin and NLAW stalking your armor. Russian special forces are being wasted in launching disjointed attacks with military police operating T-72BVM and BMPs.",1645922262.0,1645922100.0,t3_t2bat9,t3_t2bat9,,0,174,0,174,0,0,

So the reality is the amount of smart weapons is not all that much in the the scheme of things.

Since it looks like Ukraine has weathered the initial onslaught, things are looking better for them in the long run as Russia usage of high tech smart weapons is diminishing as this war goes on.

PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has asked his Belarus counterpart to demand that the country, Ukraine’s neighbor, quickly order Russian troops to leave, claiming Moscow has been given the green light to deploy nuclear arms there.

In a phone conversation Saturday, Macron denounced “the gravity of a decision that would authorize Russia to deploy nuclear arms on Belarus soil,” a statement by the presidential palace said.

Macron told Alexander Lukashenko that fraternity between the people of Belarus and Ukraine should lead Belarus to “refuse to be a vassal and an accomplice to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” the statement said.",False,1645922757.0,t3_t2bat9,t3_t2bat9,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

THREAD 1/7 Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin’s lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days. @EPPGroup @general_ben @edwardlucas @politico
2/7 Russians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.
3/7 The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.
4/7 If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.
5/7 Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.
6/7 Russia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.
7/7 The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to “accidentally” hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance! #StandWithUkraine

But, without competition, there's monopoly pricing. So the market is owned by a single party who can jack up prices. So the total market may be $2B now. That's a $1.625B raise over what they were getting with competition. (Made-up numbers, but you get the drift.)

[The first intervention since Crimea crash]

>In a scramble to prevent the invasion of Ukraine pushing Russia’s financial system into meltdown, officials in Moscow closed the stock exchange while the Bank of Russia mounted a rescue operation to put a floor under the skidding rouble.

>Russia’s currency, bonds and stocks all sank before its central bank announced its first foreign exchange intervention to shore up financial stability since 2014, when the country annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

Russia holds a formidable war chest of more than $600bn (£450bn) in foreign-exchange reserves and gold that it can use in currency markets to prop up the rouble.

>A rapidly depreciating currency makes it harder to pay off foreign debts and leads to higher prices on imported goods and lower returns on exports.

This reserve and the ability to easily play and manipulate the currencies market is a large part of what made Russia sanction resistant. This is the ""bounce-back"" we saw day 2, and Putin's reassurances to the moneyed that everything would be ok.  Without being able to further prop-up the rouble and shares in their strategic companies their existing buy backs would crumble, the rouble would dive to previously unseen depths, and things like being able to attract investors with government set interest rates etc. would spook all but the most risk adverse.

The Ukrainian soldiers who defended an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment - reportedly telling an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go f*** yourself” when asked to surrender, are believed to still be alive according to Ukrainian officials.

There were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday.

All 13 soldiers were believed to have died after refusing to surrender, Ukrainian officials announced.

However, in a recent statement, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said:

We [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive.

After receiving information about their possible location, the DPSU together with the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting work on identifying our soldiers.”

Earlier this week, Trump described Putin’s actions in Ukraine, where cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles, as “genius” and “pretty savvy.”

However, I want to point out that for as much as the world is doing what it must to stop Putin, I hope people ALSO remember that Russia as a nation is not merely the soul of one man. There are plenty of Russian citizens who oppose him, and  they're risking their lives to do so right now. Some have even already been sent to jail. As we are all praising the Ukraine, it's important that we also think of the Russians who wanted no part of this war.

By the end of all this, The Russian people are going to be left with nothing as long as he remains in power. No SWIFT. No Ruble Value, no internet, no AMD chips - Russia is going to be plunged into poverty due to the actions of this man.

There is so much Russia has been through, and this is looking to be another dark chapter once this is all over. I hope people will focus their anger, their memes, and their jokes onto the regime that started all this and keep normal Russian people in their thoughts as well going forward. The west will likely never fully understand the devastation this has done to their country, all thanks to this madman who, through rigged election, has never had the full support of the people.

[The paneled discussion on YouTube](https://youtu.be/PcCLZwU2t34)

From the description of the video:

“INFO: This video is a discussion panel from the ABC News panel discussion program 'Viewpoint', moderated by Ted Koppel, from November 20 1983. This episode focuses, narrowly speaking, on the then-recently aired nuclear war television movie 'The Day After' (information on it can be found on Wikipedia). However, I don't feel one needs to see the TV Movie to follow/understand this discussion. More broadly speaking, though, the discussion focuses on topics such as nuclear war, nuclear deterrence, and the then-present tensions between the East and West in the midst of what was a very tense and dangerous part of the Cold War. I found this to be an insightful and intriguing look into an era gone by that, I feel, can never really be truly and totally understood (in terms of what living in it was like) by those who were born after it had passed - myself included. 
The panel, moderated by Ted Koppel, consists of (in no particular order): 
- Carl Sagan (notable and distinguished scientist and an authority on the topic of Nuclear Winter)
- William F. Buckley Jr. (noted conservative political commentator, publisher of the National Review)
- Robert S. McNamara (United States Secretary of Defense to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson)
- Henry Kissinger (National Security Adviser and later Secretary of State for President Richard Nixon)
- Brent Scowcroft (National Security Adviser for President Gerald Ford, and later National Security Adviser for President George H.W. Bush)
- Elie Wiesel (Nobel Peace Prize recipient and Holocaust survivor)
and a brief interview with George Shultz (then-Secretary of State to President Ronald Reagan at the time of the broadcast)

Again, this panel is extremely intriguing into the subject of nuclear war, the effects of it, the danger of it, nuclear deterrence and how it connects to the former subjects, tensions between the East and West, and various other things - all within the context of a time where all of these things were very present, very real realities that everyone living in that time had to live with and accept.

vans full of civilians and their dogs being shot up? WW3. let's do it. im done with this. i don't care if they had AK47s with them. this is simply spiraling out of control. its clear that russian forces now have open shoot to kill orders.

what are we waiting for to intervene? Tanks shooting at apartment buildings full of people? rounding up civilians in subways and gassing them? If NATO cannot stop this from happening, NATO has failed and Putin is right about everything. Let's obliterate Putin in a massive overwhelming attack while they are focused on Ukraine. take out the ICBMs immediately, then all the mines, all the gas pipelines, refineries, oligarchs lairs, etc.

all of eastern europe, and the EU eventually, will see consequences from this inaction. this will NEVER end until the deed is done. And the EU is too tied up with them geopolitically.

It's true that both of them said that this looks as though Putin's war is unwinnable. But they are also talking about the entire course of the war. They are saying that  - even if Russia take Kyiv - he is not going to be able to install a puppet government and return troops to Russia. When they say he's losing, they mean the way that the US lost the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Let's also acknowledge that they are saying things directly for Putin's ear. 

Ukrainian citizens currently fighting will not experience this scenario as Russia losing the war. The fall of their government. The loss of Zelensky. Several years of insurgency against a puppet government and occupiers. All of these are still on the table, from the perspective of the retired general who thinks Putin is losing. And I wish more people had read the full quote instead of the headline. Because Russia is not showing any sign of backing off. China seems to dislike how inept and messy Russia has been, but we know they are just itching for a new normal in which we've gotten used to obvious and blatant aggression.

There is corruption - commanders lying about preparedness/numbers, logistics firms profit-stripping the supply lines and build-up;

There is a lack of commitment - the choice is to invade (and level the place), or to not invade. You can't half-assault someone. And by hesitating, due to Slavic brotherhood or whatever, it drives home the fact that Russian soldiers don't want to be there.

There is over-belief in the effectiveness of propaganda. That directed at the soldiers (likely in the recent exercises) will likely not have been hugely effective, as most Russians don't trust their Government (evidenced in low vaccine take-up, and memories of elderly relatives from Soviet era). 

Perversely, and this is very ironic, but (source being a BBC journalist who warned that Kremlin had become its own bubble disconnected from the rest of Russia, and reality) it is possible that Putin and close supporters really believe their own years-long propaganda that Ukraine's leadership are nothing but meth-heads who are much too busy praying to Hitler, or something, than to properly plan a defence. AND that Ukrainians are weak and have no sense of national identity (as a fake nation). AND that they would welcome the Russian forces, or be intimidated by them.

In fairness, Russian forces swept easily past Ukrainian forces in 2014, so this propaganda is supported by recent evidence. But Ukraine learned and adapted, and got Western support and weapons.

There's a tenet in the US military which is to plan for your enemy's capabilities being as good as yours.

A No Fly zone is an unprecedented escalation - it moves us from the realm of proxies to direct military intervention. If the Soviet Union had established a no-fly zone over the skies of Vietnam we would expect their planes to have been shot down. The same thing, I am reasonably sure, would happen here.

We could have put boots on the ground prior to the invasion, but now that is has started any sort of public Western physical intervention is, and should be, out of the question.

Does this forgive their acceptance of Russian money? No.

Does this forgive their years of spreading pro-Russian propaganda? No.

Will they be back at Russia's call when Ukraine ""blows over""? Probably.

Two days ago, Trump was openly praising Putin. Celebrating his demonstration of ""Biden being weak"". Flaunting that this ""never would have happened"" under Trump. He is only dialing that back because his handlers told him he will lose the next election if he doesn't shut up. Fortunately for us, he revealed his real position before his handlers got him under control. I promise you that Trump is still pro-Putin.

Even today- Putin has higher favorability among conservative voters than Joe Biden. The American right has worked very hard to get their voters to that position, where they love Russian fascism more than American democracy.

Why you should say ‘Ukraine’ not ‘the Ukraine’

You might have noticed people inadvertently saying it. You might even say it yourself.

But there’s an important reason why you shouldn’t be calling Ukraine ‘the Ukraine’ and it’s one that’s mired in a history of changing borders that dates back centuries.

“Ukraine appears firstly on English maps as ‘The Ukraine’ in the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was part of Poland,” says Dr. Frank Sysyn of the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta.

“English picks up on that way of describing it and keeps it to the present.”

The definitive article is also associated with Soviet rule (when the area was known as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), associations which Ukraine has been determined to shake since it became independent.

It’s why you might have noticed the western city of “Lvov” becoming “Lviv” and “Odessa”, the port city, becoming “Odesa.”

International media has been clarifying their stances on pronunciations and spellings of certain Ukrainian place names in recent weeks for the same reason: to avoid using Russian names or translations.

But Sysyn says the contention around “the Ukraine” far predates the Soviets.

“Ukraine really does in Slavic mean ‘borderland,’ but the term really comes into use not as the borderland of Russia but of the large Polish state,” he says.

Early world maps, in the 16th and 17th centuries, show “the Ukraine,” as it was known, as being partly in Poland and partly in modern-day Ukraine, Sysyn says.

It kept the definitive article when the area fell under the control of the Soviet Union, from 1922 until 1991, and became the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. But it kept the “the” because it was not an independent nation.

Other countries, such as Sudan and Lebanon, underwent a similar transformation before becoming independent entities, but successfully lost the “the” in common vernacular, Sysyn says.

“I cannot tell you that every language behaves in this way, but English has had a tendency to drop articles once a country is recognized,” Sysyn says.

When Ukraine became an independent country after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the new government sought to assert its autonomy by eradicating Russian spellings and pronunciations, one by one.

The capital city, spelled “Kiev” in Russian and pronounced “Kee-yiv”, became officially known as “Kyiv” and pronounced “Kee-eve” with an order from the government in 1995.

Sysyn says Ukrainian spellings changed faster than pronunciations because the Ukrainian government made official requests to the international community to adopt the change, too.

“So older people still say ‘the Ukraine’ but the Ukrainian community carried on an endless battle with every newspaper office in North America to get rid of the ‘the’,” Sysyn said.

“Above all, it was to emphasize that Ukraine is a country… and it is also associated with a mindset.”

Canadian expat Lee Reaney, editor of Lviv Today, the western city’s largest English language newspaper, says you’ll risk offending a local if you describe the country with a “the.”

“You take away their autonomy — [you’re saying] it’s a region of somewhere else, as opposed to the country in and of itself,” Reaney says.

“Russians like it when they hear ‘the Ukraine’ because the Ukraine would be part of the Soviet Union.”

However, Reaney, who is originally from Saskatoon, says within Ukraine, the definitive article has largely been dropped and it is “a fight that’s already been won.”

The onus now is for the international community to follow suit.

The debate on the spelling of place names in particular came to the fore again in 2014 during the invasion of Crimea and the Euromaidan uprising, when protests ousted pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych, and transitioned the country to a more Western-facing democracy.

This led to the Ukrainian government’s #KyivNotKiev campaign in 2018, spearheaded by the Ukrainian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This, in turn, led to major media outlets around the world adapting the new spelling and pronunciation.

“We’ve seen some successes with that one, in the sense that most foreign press have adopted Kyiv instead of Kiev,” Reaney says.

“That ones a little bit trickier because people grow up with it… and they hear it on old TV shows.”

Reaney says Ukrainian people will often forgive foreigners for mispronouncing the name, but says, “when you spell it , it really rankles Ukrainians.”

In recent days, media outlets around the world have released explanations as to why they’re pronouncing Ukrainian cities the way they are.

BBC reporter Rich Preston on Friday shared a notice on Twitter from the the BBC Pronunciation Unit, which showed the British broadcaster changed its spelling of Kiev to Kyiv, and its pronunciation, in 2019.

Global News has also chosen to use the Ukrainian spelling and pronunciation.

Merriam-Webster has gone one step further, though, and its page listing for “Kiev” now automatically takes people to the page for “Kyiv.” If you’re searching for the breaded chicken dish, however, you must search “chicken kiev.”

Of course, it’s important to note that there are instances in which countries have a “the” preceding their names and the above argument does not apply — the United States, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, for example. But these tend to be “collectives” or plurals, Sysyn says.

They’re outfitted with tech that’s newer than Russia has, (in most cases. I’ve heard of computer systems still running on 5.25” floppy disks). We also are surgical. A small force goes in first, squires points to hit, takes out what it can, then calls in the bombers. Bombers come in, bomb the military targets, and soften everything immensely. Finally ground troops move in and mop up. Basically, do more with less. 

Russia, on the other hand, has a large contingent of conscripted soldiers. It’s more like “Yuri! Here is gun. <points> Shoot that way.” Sure, they have some highly trained soldiers who rival our special forces, but they’re nowhere near the bulk of the military. Because of this, instead of being surgical like the US, they’re more brute force. They have the cannon fodder, err, manpower, to try to overwhelm the enemy. 

This is just my take on things, not fact. We did Desert Shield with roughly 100k soldiers initially, a little more than half of what Russia has around Ukraine.

Supposedly the Russian assault in the east has ground to a halt.

Two more Russian paratrooper transports have been downed.

Numerous additional armored convoys have been destroyed, some directly due to Ukrainian action, some because the Ukrainian attacks on Russian supply lines are causing their tanks to run out of fuel to be abandoned in place.

More and more news is coming out that Russia's supply problems are much larger than we thought. Sources in various intelligence agencies believe that Russia only has enough rockets for their MLRS launchers for another ~3 days worth of combat operations at the current rate of use. Their ability to produce more is hampered by the fact that pre-invasion the factories in question purchased their raw materials from Finland and Germany. Estimates currently peg the assault at ~$15B USD per day for Russia, and with their economy in freefall this is becoming a serious problem for them.

Indications are that Russia is getting desperate for a quick end, their equivalent of the US' Joint Chiefs (the ""General Staff"") has declared that the order is to take Kyiv or Kharkiv at all costs by Monday morning.

Ukraine has completed targeted destruction of all rail links pointing towards Russian aligned borders to ensure they cannot use those links for resupply.

This war is extremely important for a few reasons, but mainly because it involves ALL of the biggest powers in the world DIRECTLY. For the first time since the Cold War, there is a SERIOUS nuclear threat, in that we could all be wiped out from the face of Earth based on the upcoming events. Putin has by all accounts apparently gone mad, as in literally lost his mind, and decided to start a completely pointless war, to ""restore"" a historic Russia. He is dragging his unwilling people back into hundreds of years of history for no real reason. Why is this war considered the most dangerous one to have happened after world war 2? A few reasons:

* Russia is the biggest nuclear threat in the world, and Putin has explicitly threatened to use nuclear bombs if necessary
* China KIND OF supports Russia, which means more nukes on the opposing side
* Ukraine was just about to enter NATO, a world leader in military power and again, nukes.
* Ukraine is in Europe and Russia is threatening the entirety of Europe: more nukes
* USA supports Ukraine: second largest nuclear arsenal in the world
* Virtually every important country in the world has picked a side. The world is completely divided and committed to this war: Russia has unilaterally decided to start and continue  it, everyone else wants to stop it (even China!)
* All it takes is for Putin to lose his mind a little more (which he will, because Ukraine is actually resisting and Russia is having major setbacks) and launch nukes. If he does, the world as we know it today will be over.

There are other reasons why this is so important (Russia has threatened Finland and Sweden as well, and is actively threatening the whole world) but the gist of it is: we are all risking nuclear death. With the other 39 wars you mentioned... not really. At least, not on such a massive and imminent scale.",False,1645922475.0,t3_t2bat9,t1_hykzg2x,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

> * Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".

The problem comes with executing this point:

The reason that oil (and various other commodities) is calculated in US dollars is they have the most powerful military and economy. The US is currently the least likely to collapse. If it did the best case scenario is a worldwide mega depression. Worst case is global nuclear war.

There is no retraction that I see, it's just below the fold.

> PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has asked his Belarus counterpart to demand that the country, Ukraine’s neighbor, quickly order Russian troops to leave.

> In a phone conversation Saturday, Macron denounced “the gravity of a decision that would authorize Russia to deploy nuclear arms on Belarus soil,” a statement by the presidential palace said.

> Macron told Alexander Lukashenko that fraternity between the people of Belarus and Ukraine should lead Belarus to “refuse to be a vassal and an accomplice to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” the statement said.

> Belarus was one one of several axes used by Russia to launch attacks on Ukraine, with Belarus the point to move toward the capital Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official has said.

> Macron has pushed persistently to try to claw out a ceasefire amid the war, using the telephone to talk to all sides, diplomacy and sanctions by the European Union.",False,1645925647.0,t3_t2bat9,t1_hyl6bkl,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Biden has essentially been laying the groundwork for the western response to this invasion for months. It's his administration efforts helped unite the countries into enacting such harsh sanctions.

Additionally, Trump has been a Putin ally from the very beginning, and in fact his election was aided directly by Russian influence campaigns in the US. He would have never organized such a response, and probably (also looking at his most recent statements) would have hindered an organized response. For instance, he would have probably opposed the SWIFT disconnection.

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

I think the past week has seen a shift. We have some politicians and propagandists who are still in bed with Putin after the invasion (Trump, Tucker Carlson)... but many right-wing politicians also have been doing the right thing.

A great example is Marco Rubio. He is a Republican Senator from Florida, and has some disgusting policies. But he has also been very good about supporting Ukraine - just check his Twitter.

Really, the US has 5 parties:

* Democratic Socialists (Senator Bernie Sanders,  Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)

* Neoliberals (President Biden, President Obama)

* Neoconservatives (Senator Mitt Romney, Representative Liz Cheney, President George W. Bush)

* Conservatives (Senator Mitch McConnell, Senator Marco Rubio)

* Far-Right (President Trump, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene)

Each of these groups has problems with the others. Some are minor, some aren't.

The Republican Party in the US is largely dominated by the Conservative and Far-Right factions, to the point where [Liz Cheney got kicked out of the Republican Party because she was too centrist.](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/15/1056025589/wyoming-gop-votes-to-stop-recognizing-cheney-as-a-republican) Those two factions make up about 35-40% of the country, with like 10% or so going to the neoconservatives.

Similarly, there's fighting going on in the Democratic Party because people can't agree on how big social programs should be. The Social Democrats want to go far and put out big safety nets; the neoliberals still worry about funding and taxes. It isn't as bad as it is on the right, but it's there. This is about 20% Social Democrats (mostly young people) and 30% neoliberals.

(Obviously, numbers are ballpark and this is just based on ""feeling"" moreso than anything else.)

This crisis has united everyone but the Far-Right on the side of Ukraine. You can still find division if you look for it (again, Trump is a big Far-Right mouthpiece), but most Americans are unified in a way they haven't been since 2008, if not earlier.",False,1645925507.0,t3_t2bat9,t1_hyl3qqa,,3,14,0,14,0,0,

Lmao yeah, for what Russia has been putting it and what Ukraine can actually get up and off the ground it's claiming an awful lot. Especially for a single day. That's more than Russia has lost in some whole military engagements before. Don't get me wrong, they've probably downed a lot, but contrary to what reddit likes to believe is a total russian air failure, they simply have not dedicated a lot of their air force yet. Those numbers with the loses on their side they are reporting would be kill to death ratios so massive they couldn't be reasonably accounted for.

They are downing these around kyiv, between all the attention there someone would've filmed or taken a picture of the massive fire ball,, and if not enough people live near kyiv where someone would've gone and taken pics of the wreckage, like ukranians have with everything else.
