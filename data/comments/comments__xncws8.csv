>1. So far, there is a feeling that there are more external effects than inherent. That is, they scared the whole country, literally told every family that the war is a nightmare, that their usual life is over, they created a wave of panic - and why? They gather men, including those over 40, or even over 50, give them inferior weapons (sometimes literally rusty), send them to Ukraine - what will they fight there? Well, even if they train them for a month, give them some bulletproof vests and helmets (although it’s not a fact - they didn’t have enough before), what will they even do against well-trained and motivated Ukrainian soldiers, American intelligence, modern weapons, drones? Some results may appear by the spring, if by some miracle the mobilization mechanism itself can be adjusted, but so far it is clearly working with great failures.

>2. I even had a conspiracy fantasy that this is a bizarre way to end the war as soon as possible (as Putin promised in Samarkand). Public opinion has been shaken by propaganda about the war - the Russians want victory and to reach Kyiv, but how to change their mood very quickly? Announce general mobilization - and the war will suddenly become unpopular, and its termination, accordingly, popular. But I'm not serious - it's unlikely that there is such a cunning plan - it's likely more like agony and bluff on Putin's part, multiplied by his illusions about what the Russians want and how they really are.

>3. In general, mobilization looks like a monstrous stress for the system, no less massive than the war itself. Everything, of course, went wrong: they don’t call those who were promised, they have to clarify the original decree with a new decree (prohibiting the call of students), even propagandists and Z-channels are sounding the alarm, talking about a mess and demanding that the military commissars be held accountable.

>4. Against this background, the behavior of Kadyrov is very interesting, who, after a small rally of mothers in Grozny, suddenly announced that there would be no mobilization in Chechnya (and what, is it possible? By the decision of the head of the subject?) Then he attacked the deviationists with accusations (apparently, from *other* regions - there is no mobilization in Chechnya) and finally offered to send half of the employees of law enforcement agencies (2.5 million people) to fight. The latter is a popular idea, a rare case when even the liberal opposition agrees with Kadyrov's proposal. The feeling is that Kadyrov has already started his big game, anticipating post-war (perhaps post-Putin) instability.

>5. Mobilization and distribution of weapons to people increases the risk of civil war, and will definitely contribute to the growth of crime.

>6. It is unlikely that Putin seriously expects to win the war with the help of the mobilized - rather, he hopes once again to make a formidable impression on the West. Do not forget that mobilization is a response to the counteroffensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Putin is afraid of losing Kherson. He dreams of somehow ending the war by convincing Ukraine to give him Crimea and Donbass, but he is unlikely to get what he wants.

>7. Nuclear blackmail will increase. Given that Putin has made many mistakes and committed self-destructive acts, the likelihood of using nuclear weapons is increasing, but I personally still rate it low. Another thing is that there will be many nuclear threats, because the bomb is already really Putin's last hope after mobilization.

>8. Protests are still extremely small - us submissive Russians prefer to protest with their feet and flee the country. But the decisions were made very unpopular, the protest potential is great. It can break through in unexpected places, at unexpected moments. When something breaks in the system and people realize that “now it is possible”, the protests can be very large-scale.",False,1664098217.0,t3_xncws8,t3_xncws8,,0,103,0,103,0,0,

Day 214 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, but missiles were fired once, at 11pm, apparently it was just 2 missiles and both of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast. Other than that it was pretty quiet, though we still get quite a lot of air raid alerts, so sirens are blaring often, though most of them are uneventful, which is great.

The fact that NASAMS are finally here is great news, and right after Zelensky announced them arriving to Ukraine, some people hinted that at least one of those systems is already protecting Kharkiv. Now that I’m thinking about it, four days ago at least 3 out of 7-8 missiles that were aimed at Kharkiv were intercepted, and usually that doesn’t happen. We pretty much never managed to intercept any of the missiles, which is why we constantly asked to strengthen our air defense around Kharkiv, looks like it finally happened.

Girkin said that after they annex our territories in a couple of days, they will make an ultimatum to leave all the territories that they have “annexed” or they will start a “war”. Yeah that’s funny, they do a “referendum”, and then say that everyone wants to be a part of Russia, and now they think that we will comply with that? Maybe threaten to nuke us some more as well?

They don’t even control half of the territories that they want to annex, and every day they are losing more of the ones that they do still control. That breakthrough north from Lyman seems very promising so far. Will be hilarious seeing Russia lose the territories that they claim as theirs.

[Latest Charts (25 Sept)](https://www.reddit.com/r/maplady/comments/xnh015/ukrainian_territorial_control_as_of_25_september/)

**What does the data show?**

In short, Ukraine controls 79.4% of their core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22, and 78.7% just 7 days ago. Before February's invasion, they controlled 90.9%.

In the recent counter-offensive, Ukraine liberated 0.9% of their territory (over 2,000 square miles), and have shown in the past week that they can hold this territory.

🔴 Russian KIAs sit at 29,200 (± 2,900), and the rolling 30-day average is 120 KIA per day.

🟡 Ukrainian KIAs sit at 12,700 (± 600), and the rolling 30-day average is 40 KIA per day.

To do this analysis I run simple colour analysis tools on the daily update maps published by ISW, and chart in a spreadsheet how these proportions (one colour for Russia, the other for Ukraine) have changed throughout the war.

Laying out the timeline of reported attacks makes things clear:

1. Russians surprised Ukrainians in the north with the drones two weeks ago, hitting two IFVs and two SPGs.

2. A few days pass with no news except one Ukrainian claim of an intact capture of the drone and several shootdowns.

3. Now we get daily news about the drones being shot down over Dnipro and hitting buildings in Odessa.

So sometime between \#1 and \#2, the Ukrainian military in the north started shooting these flying lawnmowers out of the sky and Russia switches back to traditional aviation in light of the on-going counteroffensive on Lyman but get eaten alive by MANPADs, losing 5 aircraft in two days.

Russia starts launching the drones against Dnipro and Odessa. Dnipro is closer to the frontline and has SHORAD that blows the drones out of the sky. Odessa has a bunch of national guardsmen with AKs and the drones are able to make their attack run.

From the specs, the VAMPIRE systems we've sent last month should be highly effective against these drones both in cost and performance. Ukraine just needs more to cover all their bases.

I belive the AFU has established atleast 5 crossings over the Oskil and SD river. The reason the russians are prepared to defend Lyman until the last man, is it's a key blocking positions for the axis of advance east of the  Zherebets river.

Once Lyman falls, the axis west of Zherebets will have their flank protected by the eastern axis and they can start advancing towards Svatove.

&#x200B;

\-The US using back channels to let Russia know the consequence of a tactial strike is not new and has been ongoing for months. This does not mean a tactical nuke is close to imminent

\-The conscription of 1 million means Putin and Russia are planning for the long term

\-Ukraine for months has been using western weapons to strike targets on Russian soil and also in Crimea.

&#x200B;

\-Russia is suffering and rightfully so, but they are nowhere near the brink of collapse you would think they were if you only spent your time here. Reminds me of reddit overplaying  Bernie Sanders' chances. There are still so many economic options on the table to punish Russia

&#x200B;

\-""People thought they wouldn't invade Ukraine"" The US government did. And the US government and several close to it still believe it's highly unlikely that Russia resorts to a tactical nuke in the near future. They have been blunt with Russia upfront for months letting them know the deal. The recent public comments are only in response to being asked by media about Putin's recent round of empty threats.

&#x200B;

\-You think a man so paranoid of death is going to want to resort to dying in nuclear fury? There are several lines of escalation here. Russia STILL hasn't attacked many of the Nato Supply lines they know about in Ukraine. If Russia does somehow face revolution that is a threat, it will be a threat because it has the backing of the Russian military turning against the Kremlin and therefore this ""big red button"" (which isn't a button, multiple chain of commands involved) won't even be on the table.

\-The fact that Putin is even holding these sham referndums to justify sending conscripts to those area show this is a man trying to do anything at all to protect himself/not a mad dog with nothing to lose.

If we are using cold-war Era realpolitik to analyze this situation, we should conclude that Russia will not use nuclear weapons and we should not base policy on the assumption that they will.

Part of the MAD doctrine was that Russia needs to believe we are as ruthless as they are in order to maintain either an edge over Russia or at least equal footing.

That's why Nixon utilized the [madman theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) to achieve goals such as ending the Vietnam War when the US was taking a beating...

>I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Sounds familiar right?

>I call it the Madman Theory, Ivan. I want the Ukrainians and the West to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Putin is obsessed with beating NATO. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the tactical nuclear button"" and Zelenskyy himself will be in Prague in two days begging for peace.

In my opinion, you can judge what most international actors are willing to due by assuming they are pragmatic actors with no morals or ego, only the goal of advancing their position.

There are no outcomes to using a nuclear weapon that advance Russia's position. If they use a big nuke and start a nuclear war with the West.... we all die and Russia gains nothing. If Russia uses a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine they will lose their only benefactors - India and China - who both see that as a huge red line. Again, Russia would end up in a worse position.

The only thing Russia actually benefits from is threatening to use nuclear weapons... and that's what they're best at.

One thing that people should keep in mind when posting or reading absolutely any type of Russian content is that although some things might seem stupid or even go against Kremlin itself, it's almost always intentionally catered towards you in a way that they want you to see it. Publicized conflicts, griefs, criticisms, insults, and threats are all tools manufactured by themselves to sell you a narrative that they want you to believe at this very moment.

It is useful to understand that negative things can also be positive for the image of Russia as they can control what's being said and how it's being said, or even what people might conclude next after the said criticisms.

Negative news about Russia's war that is televised is used as a tool to measure the Russian people's current vigilance and attitude towards things or to sell a view that the war is calming down or changing in some manner and get a different direction from European leaders regarding donating equipment and posing sanctions.

There are a lot of people thinking that Girkin throwing around insults is a sign of progress but one should make a simple deduction that no Russian who is that close to the military and is in Russia and has their message publicized among Russians, is not truly trying to take down the status quo or harm Kremlin or change their methods against their will. His job so far has been to insult Kremlin with some lightweight insults and in return, Kremlin gets more people who are politically more accepting of mobilization. Again, useful for Kremlin and intentional.

A speaker on Russian television or even just Telegram posting about how incompetent and lazy and stupid the generals are with corruption ruining the quality of the equipment might give you a cathartic feeling of seeing Russia getting eaten by their own but the goal was from the beginning to not make room for real criticism of things that might hurt them a lot more such as 55,000 soldiers dead or Russian stock exchange tanking to a 50% drop - things that people would actually truly care about.

The threats of nukes are also often very stupid and completely ridiculous that don't make any sense even if there would be a serious situation developing. That is because the very fact of it being stupid makes people talk about nukes and other topics related to it and that's useful for them. If they have deemed that talking about nukes is good for their current political goals, then they will do everything possible to have people talk about it. This is why all these things happen in waves.

It is inevitable that people will post Russian media and Russian politicians or speakers but in general, if you want to have an accurate representation of what's going on politically in Russia, you will only deceive yourself if you listen to their own manufactured criticisms.

* It's not just 300.000 being mobilized. Putin will keep drawing people and there is plenty of AK's
* The untrained can still occupy cities, sit in the trenches, do logistics and other tasks that will free up the more experienced
* Putin will pull troops and equipment back from foreign countries and far regions (possibly replacing them with the drafted)

It's all well and good to make memes and ridicule, but this needs to be taken seriously. We must ramp up military support as much as possible (including incentivizing companies to contribute) and start thinking in operations within Russia to destabilize the country.

You are much less willing to fight if it is *your* family that is suffering back home because the power plant, bridge and tunnel got hit, and you lost pay because the pipeline got blown up. This is only a temporary opportunity as internal security gets increased, but that capability is taken from the front and complex equipment using Western parts can't be repaired again.

Ukraine can certainly get the capability to move saboteurs behind enemy lines, so I suspect the reason they have held back is because of

1. Ressource priority
2. Fear of Russian mobilization
3. Fear of Western reaction

But the thing I worry about is a desperate Russia could possibly organise a bombing campaign against Ukrainian cities using strategic bombers if the phoney referenda gave pretext to defend the motherland. Soemthing far bigger than what we've seen before. It would be heavy, indiscriminate and horrific. It would change the way Putin was framing the whole conflict, and he would then attempt to force Ukrainian surrender and use an inflated conscript army not to fight a Ukrainian army that would make mincemeat of them in a conventional conflict, but to occupy the rubble.

It's a horrible thought. It is possible. It would forever turn Russia into a pariah. But it wouldn't need Nukes. Could Ukrainian air defences stop it? Would NATO step in with conventional arms? I'm not so sure- it would increase worries over the whole thing going nuclear. 

I am a little worried about where this goes from here. Ukraine has gained the upper hand.  The referenda are clearly designed to give Putin an excuse to change the conflict from an operation in Ukraine to what he will sell as a defence of Russia proper (as absurd and perverse as that claim would be) which does let the gloves come off. I know he doesn't value the lives of his soldiers, but if his conscripts failed and casualties mounted with little gains, what would be the point? Surely he doesn't think they could turn the tide by themselves? It just imperils his regime for little chance of a win.

- It's the least valuable of the regions Russia still controls, militarily, agriculturally, industrially (considering S-L is destroyed).  
- It would greatly increase rather than reduce the border with Russia or Russian-occupied territories.  That means it would take more manpower and resources to defend which can't then be used for offensives elsewhere.  Ukraine used all its available reserves to initiate the Kharkiv counter-offensive and would then be reliant on those same forces to hold it.  It would mean nothing new for Zp, Kh, Dt.  
- It would leave open the possibility of encirclement by Russian forces in the future since Russia would only need to close the pocket via ~300km of territory from northern Donetsk to Belgorad.  This is a strategically *stupid* position.  

If they get it for cents on the dollar, fine, but if it takes real effort, there are simply better uses of Ukraine's time and energy.  Personally I think they're looking to buffer the natural Oskil river border with whatever they can get before the ineffective but numerically-uncertain results of mobilization create a standoff well into 2023.  They're positioning for the long haul, and maybe looking to capture as much Russian equipment and free as many citizens from occupation as they can in that time.  That way if Ukraine has to retreat (hopefully for a short period), they can do what they did at the S-L salient and make Russia pay for every inch of territory nobody wanted in the first place, and then let them hit a wall at the river.  

Towards that end, they *really* should be looking at Melitopol.  Which is why I think Kharkiv is continuing only because they are already in position there.  Melitopol and other urban areas need rescuing, because thousands of poorly-trained and worse-equipped soldiers might not be a threat at the front, but they will be a threat as an occupying force.",False,1664162636.0,t3_xncws8,t1_ipx962t,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

He's also broken the unspoken pact with Russian citizens, and he's fired his military chief in logistics. Mobilized men are being shipped off to the frontlines with just a day notice and no training.

He wants a million man meat wall thick enough to stall Ukrainian advances and buy time for energy shortages and public discourse to take root in the West. He desperately hopes that political pressure and doubling down on nuclear posturing will make western leaders push Zelenskyy to call off the offensive.

Ukraine is reliant on western support to supplement these disadvantages.  

Attackers as a rule of thumb take much higher casualties. And a poorly trained conscripted put in a position where he can not retreat will fight whether his heart is in it or not. So i think we will see more last stands and desperate defences to grind Ukraine down. Those that surrender can also strain resources. He could also position them anywhere on the boarder to force ukraine to move troops. 

I think he is betting on western support waning over time. Especially as Europe hits winter. I also think he is thinking on a larger scale than what is happening now.

Some of what he has managed to, so far:

1. Expose his own army. Its corruption. Its incompetence. Its cruelty.
2. He spent his own army. The best soldiers and the best material.
3. He destabilized his own backyard, losing his sphere of influence (oh the irony…), 
4. A man obsessed with demography is sending hundreds of thousands of young men to die in Ukraine 
5. There are embers of uprisings within ruzzia glowing stronger by the hour.
6. The economy is in shambles.
7. Their industry is in shambles. 
8. If EU gets through this winter, he loses his leverage AND his income at the same time.
9. More and more former soviet states are moving away from ruzzia, looking to the west
10. China isnt happy. This disrupts their new silk road.
11. He has made NATO look almost superhuman. NATO doctrine and arms are superior in every way and not a single NATO soldier has even join the war. 

This is history unfolding in front of our eyes. I really cant see ruzzia getting out in any good way. The best outcome for ruzzia is probably very minor land gains in exchange for half a million casualities and a ruined nation.

Edit: i have to add. I dont think ruzzia makes any gains what-so-ever. Its much more probable we see a complete collapse and balkanization of ruzzia after the current leadership is liquidated.",1664140595.0,1664140348.0,t3_xncws8,t1_ipvzfqe,,1,22,0,22,0,0,

If we are using cold-war Era realpolitik to analyze this situation, we should conclude that Russia will not use nuclear weapons and we should not base policy on the assumption that they will.

Part of the MAD doctrine was that Russia needs to believe we are as ruthless as they are in order to maintain either an edge over Russia or at least equal footing.

That's why Nixon utilized the [madman theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) to achieve goals such as ending the Vietnam War when the US was taking a beating...

>I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Sounds familiar right?

>I call it the Madman Theory, Ivan. I want the Ukrainians and the West to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Putin is obsessed about border security. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Zelenskyy himself will be in Prague in two days begging for peace.

In my opinion, you can judge what most international actors are willing to due by assuming they are pragmatic actors with no morals or ego, only the goal of advancing their position.

There are no outcomes to using a nuclear weapon that advance Russia's position. If they use a big nuke and start a nuclear war with the West.... we all die and Russia gains nothing. If Russia uses a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine they will lose their only benefactors - India and China - who both see that as a huge red line. Again, Russia would end up in a worse position.

The only thing Russia actually benefits from is threatening to use nuclear weapons... and that's what they're best at.

[Great article posted by another user](https://www.vox.com/world/2022/9/22/23366499/putin-russia-ukraine-war-nuclear-threat-expert) of an interview with a nuclear weapons expert...

>As Baklitskiy pointed out, the threat of using nuclear weapons — not actually using them — may be the most powerful tool nuclear states have.  
>  
>“Nuclear weapons have almost this mystical status; once they’re used, that’s the end of the world,” he said. But, he said, imagine if you do use one — like a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine — “and it doesn’t change any political calculus on the ground. What then? How much have you lost in that moment? All of a sudden, you’re not one of the countries who have this power to destroy worlds, and everybody has to bend before you. You’re just a country which has big bombs which can explode.”",False,1664131855.0,t3_xncws8,t1_ipvbj4h,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

I also get the feeling a lot of the commenters most vocal about nukes (other than bots or trolls) are terminally online and don’t have a removed perspective.

Crimea, very much yes. Most of the population is descended from Russian settlers during post Stalin times.

Crimea was a part of Russia until an internal transfer in the 1950s of the Soviet Union. 

Crimeans in the few referendums we've seen (not talking about the Russian one in 2014) was always starkly different than the rest of Ukraine. In its last Ukrainian election, the pro Russian party won 90%+ of the seats. The Russian military always maintained a huge presence there post independence, meaning that it also had close ties there. A very large chunk of Ukrainian forces on crimea defected to Russia after annexation. While the party that won didn't advocate for uniting with Russia, the ""party of regions"" was undeniably a Russian shilling party. 

Suffice to say, there were genuine separate pushes there.

Two main points:

Ukraine telegraphed that they would attack in the south at Kherson, Russia moved their best units there, and then Ukraine counter-attacked and drove the Russians out of Kharkiv region in the north. In one of the greatest counter attacks in post WWII history, they took Izium (main Russian staging area) and Kupiansk (main Russian transport hub) in the northern Donbas front. In the process Ukraine captured more tanks and armored vehicles than most countries have sent in military aid. There will be books and movies about [this counteroffensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Ukrainian_Kharkiv_counteroffensive), and [Syrskyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Syrskyi) will be counted among the great generals in history. He commands the counteroffensive in addition to being the general in charge of defending Kyiv in the beginning of the war.

In the aftermath of that Putin decided to mobilize, calling it something partial, but seemingly calling up everyone, including the drunks, the old, and even disabled men. Protests are beginning in Russia, and they might kick off properly over the next week. All international border crossings are backed up for 10's of km's by people trying to flee Russia, while they now have laws that send people to jail for 10+ years if they do try and get out.

I would bet more on Putin launching one at the US or Berlin, since Germany's like the central command of NATO (more or less), but realsitically, if enough nukes worked, he'd probably launch at all of the countries, not just one.    


I do not think NATO would try to negotiate if he nuked a major power, it would be all out war, per article 4 (I think), so it would be all nukes flying at Moscow.   


if a nuke is launched, they can predict where it's going, since it'll be via ICBM. Giving them time to intercept it.  IF Russia's entire arsenal is launched, they may still know the targets but it'd be too many to intercept.   


the UK should have the same advance warning that the US would, since I'm assuming the tech is shared between NATO countries.

I brought this up a while ago and every knucklehead couldn’t give much of an answer on what would happen if tactical nukes were used. 

I think it’s possible for this very reason. Putin wants to stay in power. He will not have a Gorbachev retirement. So if it comes down to “lose power” or “use tactical nukes to sway the tide of battle and have a chance to stay in power” well he is gonna use tactical nukes. 

And there is little that can be done. Unless Ukraine gets some more quality SAMs. Usually the dipshits reply to my comment by saying something like “moscow gets glassed” but don’t have enough brain cells to think of the next step. Which is the world ends. 

This is why the west has been slow rolling support. It doesn’t want Ukraine to have massive and fast victories that are destabilizing and may cause a knee jerk reaction.

Putin plans to use the TikTok battalion as 'blocking' units to prevent the retreat of untrained conscripts. Essentially if Russian troops try to retreat Kadyrov opens fire. The hope is that the conscripts will be more terrified of their own than the enemy. 

See, the RF is really just a motley collection of different security forces (read: vassals), nominally under the Russian umbrella, but in reality are completely independent. The FSB is Putin's; the MOD is Shoigu; Wagner is Prigozhin's; Chechens are Kadyrov's; if one of these men refuse Putin's command then the FSB has to step in and quell the dissent. 

But the FSB has its hands full; Wagner is SEVERELY depleted; the MOD is falling apart; yet somehow Kadyrov managed to avoid the worst of the fighting. He's relatively unscathed, and that preserved strength means that he's one of the strongest pillars still holding up the Putin regime. As long as that's the case then he's untouchable. 

Here we see the flaw inherent in a feudalistic structure: if the King's authority is only maintained through strength, then the loss of that strength will mean a proportionate loss of authority.

His idea was that 60,000 (the Ukrainian claim for Russian losses) would a) deform the Russian force structure and disrupt performance to almost breaking point; and b) prompt a faster response such as the part-mobilisation that we're seeing, due to its shorter-term unsustainability.

It strikes me that yes, in a modern army, there are many in support for each person directly fighting. But I have severe doubts that just any warm body could do the job, without training and unmotivated. 

Sure, there must be plenty of ‘toting heavy stuff and digging ditches’ type work that can basically be done by coerced recruits, even if untrained and treated basically as slaves.

That is not a problem. That is the correct position to take. Imagine if Biden were to take a similar tone and position to Putin. That would create tremendous unrest around the globe. It would create real effects such as people relocating to countries that were considered ""safe"", people retrieving their assets from the market (and thereby tanking the market) etc. 

> but Putin never took such stance

Of course. It's the old adage, ""If you are weak, appear strong"". Putin is deliberately trying to sow doubt, fear and chaos, whereas Biden is trying to provide stability. Hence, Biden will indicate he is not interested in war, whereas Putin will state he 'does not fear' war with NATO.

Fact is, Russia *is* weak, and Russia would get crushed in any type of conventional conflict - and fact is *neither party* is particularly interested in an all out conflict. That doesn't mean such a conflict won't happen, it just means that looking at what someone ""says"" is the entirely wrong approach. 

We must look at actions and we must look at interests.

I have deep concerns about nuclear escalation as well, I have to disagree with you on the above. Russian troll farms exist, they've been documented and covered quite extensively in recent years since Trump took office. There are offices that employ hundreds of young Russians to sit in front of a computer, create social media accounts and mask their presence by engaging in unrelated topics to appear legitimate.  They are assigned propaganda tasks overseen by the FSB. Their internet activity is often indistinguishable from yours and mine until they are instructed on what the topic du jour is.",False,1664131653.0,t3_xncws8,t1_ipvbwxc,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Social media emerges as a new vector with faster wider reach than ever and has been studied and capitalized on for 20 years now by these organizations.

A mere say 10 years ago, not long before Maidan and Crimea, they have already developed a strategy around seeding dummy accounts for future use, or taking over existing real user accounts to repurpose them to manipulate public opinion at a critical moment in time - like say when you've launched the biggest war in 80 years and its not at all going according to plan.

I don't think its far fetched at all. Ridiculously easy to implement.

That's not how it works. Third parties buy or farm accounts and have a large pool of these zombie accounts with just enough activity to somewhat look legitimate. 

When someone pays them enough, they deploy these accounts to amplify whatever message they are paid to.

Putin wants to stay in power. He isn’t getting a Gorbachev retirement. So losing power is worse than death. So if he gets desperate and it’s between “for sure losing power” and “maybe tactical nukes will buy me some time” he will do it.

There is zero indication that ever was in the cards. He also has claimed that Russia wants to attack all ex-soviet countries, which would also not have happened, even if the west hadn't provided the amount of aid they did.

So if they're not going to attack Russia itself for fears of it escalating into an all out nuclear war pretty much the only way to respond left would either be with a full out naval blockade of Russia or attacking Russian positions in Ukraine. I'm not sure a blockade would look like a strong enough response even though it would completely cripple what's left of the Russian economy, you'd need an armed response. Since I think anyone would be unlikely to want to send ground troops into Ukriane they pretty much only leaves using US airpower to completely destroy Russian air defenses in Ukraine to attain air superiority and then mercilessly pounding the Russian forces in Ukraine so the war ends fairly quickly  with a total Ukrainian victory.

Putin's army has no ability at this point to even exploit the breakthrough chance a tactical nuke would give him. So it doesn't win him the war, in fact with the entrance of US airpower he loses the war very quickly.

So what advantage does using one even get him?

* It is actually questionable whether they enough functioning equipment. It is not just guns but ammunition, webbing, boots, cold weather clothing, entrenchment tools...
* No on all counts. Untrained troops cannot manage logistics, they actually consume them and occupying cities requires a lot of discipline and training to do it properly. Sitting in trenches they can basically do but if they are underfed and poorly equipped their utility is questionable. Bear in mind they are not defending their own motherland.
* ""Putin will pull troops and equipment back from foreign countries and far regions (possibly replacing them with the drafted)"". This is possible *if* Putin was smart. There are in excess of a million garrison and paramilitary troops in total in Russia and even though they are relatively poorly armed and trained they would still be better in Ukraine then the unequipped, unorganised, untrained, undisciplined conscripts.

Curiosity, while the A-10's overall range is over five times greater than the Su25, it's combat range is notably less).

Also, the A-10 can carry up to 16 MALD's (a lunchable, programmable aircraft radar decoy, that I imagine could be useful in a very neat way, at the moment - the only other aircraft in the NATO inventory that can carry that many is the B-52).

There's a bunch of other modernization that's happening to them as well, so I think the trash talk about the A-10 is a bit overblown and, I've started to wonder if some of it is being initiated by troll accounts.

Regardless, I think that the considerations regarding the craft by the people responsible for such a request are focused on whether or not the UAF are in a position to be able to support an additional aircraft frame.

I.e., in order of resources I imagine it would require:

- Support crews and mechanics - everything from training to having them committed to their specific jobs.

- Parts and logistics.  It's not *just* an airplane.  It's thousands and thousands of parts attached to each other.  ... Can't exactly FedEx 'em into a warzone so there's that.  (*Although*, many of the airframe's components are designed to be used on either side of the plane; they're not symmetrically opposite, as one might expect - *instead*, they are *identical*. So there's that as well - it was designed for battlefield maintenance.)

- Pilots.  Yes, there are existing Ukrainian pilots who have been trained on, and flown, *actual*, A-10's (pilot exchange program under Gen. Breedlove), as well as a few who have been doing simulator training currently.  The catch is that it would seem that Ukraine already has planes for them to fly and A-10's aren't sitting on a runway, fueled, flight-checked, waiting for a pilot.

I think that the A-10 would be a more useful aircraft for Ukraine than the Su25, but I also know that the people who are responsible for requesting their equipment know more about Ukraine's current capacity than I do.

*All* that said, if the A-10 does not make a debut during this war, I think it's likely it will replace Ukraine's Su25's as their close support aircraft of choice afterwards.",1664151392.0,1664151193.0,t3_xncws8,t1_ipwl7t3,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

 >Draft evasion in the Vietnam War was a common practice in the United States and in Australia. Significant draft avoidance was taking place even before the U.S. became heavily involved in the Vietnam War. The large cohort of Baby Boomers allowed for a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college and graduate students. More than half of the 27 million men eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War were deferred, exempted, or disqualified.

You really do have to stack a bunch of high-mobility, high-logistics-capacity units into the area of planned advance, and you need to take weeks to months to plan for the operation. You have to line up reinforcements, 2-3x the unit's weight in supplies and fuel, and you have to have garrison, police, security and engineer forces lined up as well to hold the territory you take, de-mine roads, track down Russians left behind, seize equipment, repair infrastructure.

There was some talk a month ago that Ukraine had three well built offensive operation units from their summer planning phase ready to go. Each offensive op unit was approximately 4-6 brigades strong -- about the size of a beefy mechanized division. One such unit attacked Kharkiv. One may or may not have been staged at Kherson but was likely held not and was not used in the opening of the September offensive on Kherson, and one was either held in reserve at Kharkiv or staged south at Zaporozhe.

After the successful Kharkiv count-offensive, both Ukraine and Russia-biased mil-analysts and OSINT largely agreed that another unit was confirmed to be staged in the Zaporozhe area, either as a feint or for a real offensive towards Melitpol/Mariupol. I haven't heard much about that region in the past 3 weeks since that time. Supposedly Ukraine has started the heavy shelling ""battle shaping"" phase of an offensive towards Melitipol, but that was 1-2 weeks ago and there has not been any reported heavy movement there. 

It is possible that one of these units was reconstituted after Kharkiv and sent back across Oskil, but that would be very surprising. After a count-offensive of that scale, it would probably be very difficult to ensure a division-sized unit is refreshed, re-manned, re-supplied, repaired, and re-armed well enough to plan a new operation all over again in a matter of 1-2 weeks. 

It's also possible one of the three division-sized offensive units was indeed held in reserve at Kharkiv and was not used for occupation duty like many suspected it would be. Perhaps it's now been brought up to the Oskil front and is being thrust into a second stage that was more rapidly improvized and is relying on the poor quality of Russian defenses to do much of its work for it.",False,1664123989.0,t3_xncws8,t1_ipumr79,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

Girkin is absolutely not catering to the Kremlin. His words are damaging to their authority. As a whole, he is a net-negative for the Kremlins aims, regardless of his intention. You allude to a form of coordination, which I reject. Fact is the Kremlin only has limited control over what is said by all different factions under their umbrella. Sure, they control main stream TV, but outside of that it's much more free. Depending on the status and position of every commenter as well as the size of their audience, they can get away with either more or less. They are not ""coordinating"" with the Kremlin, this is not ""catered content"", but rather they are playing in accordance to the rules of a shared system - meaning they recognize the Kremlin is more powerful than them which means they cannot move against the Kremlin too directly.

Negotiations would take place. The war ends. The deaths stop. Ukraine gets a ton of sympathy and finances to rebuild, but likely loses those territories Russia's already squatting in.

Look as much as I like the idea of Ukraine winning a complete victory, I just don't think it's realistic without nukes coming into play unless Putin gets outed by force. That's the only scenario where Russia can lose without resorting to nukes.

The way we hear the story of the Western Front in WWII is that France's Maginot Line was a failure because Germany just went around.  It is not a necessarily wrong account.  Actually accurate... mostly.  

The Germans had built the West Wall on the German side facing France's Maginot line.  Because the West Wall was there the German high command felt comfortable leaving a small number of troops there.  That freed up most of the Wehrmacht for the assault through the Ardennes.  A different way of telling the same story but also not factually incorrect.  

The French engineers were not as stupid as historians like to paint them.  They did extend defensive networks back across to the English Channel.  The French emptied out those bunkers and advanced to join the Belgians.  Belgium had been neutral.  That meant the surprisingly large German force met the French (and British) in fields in Belgium where defenses had not been adequately prepared.  That went poorly for the allies.  

France still had soldiers occupying the bunkers and had guns and ammunition for the guns.  Big guns are too heavy to move forward.  This part was where it got strange.  The French rear units decided that they were losing and needed to retreat.  There was not a good reason for the Germans to be able to drive straight to Normandy while filling up at French gas stations.  The perception that they were losing the war was what broke France.  The Germans might have gotten across the Somme anyway, but it would not have occured on the time scale that it did without the effect of panic.  

The flavor of the story changes depending on which aspects of the story you emphasize.  Does the battlefield really match the flow of WWII battles?  Do the soldiers in the battles have expectations that are set by historical accounts of world wars?  Journalists and witnesses on the ground are in the midst of a chaotic situation.

Different context. Fact is that neither China nor the US can realistically speaking conquer each other due to their respective locations. They might vie for dominance in the pacific theater, but there is no way one can threaten the other to the point where their very existence is at stake. And say what you want about China being an autocratic and terrible regime (which they are), but they have never engaged in nuclear brinkmanship as Russia and even the US have. So the chances of such a conflict turning nuclear are simply much lower.

Between Russia and NATO that is very different. Russia is highly indefensible over land from the European direction. And similarly Eastern Europe is easily accessible to Russia. A war between NATO and Russia by it's very nature would be existential for almost all participants, and therefore could turn nuclear much easier.

Additionally, one could say that the public misperceives the threat of nuclear escalation in both the hypothetical Russian/NATO conflict as well as the Sino-American conflict.

 >Talking to Americans was a regular feature presented by Rick Mercer on the Canadian political satire show This Hour Has 22 Minutes, which was later spun off into a one-hour special that aired on April 1, 2001 on CBC Television. The purpose of the skit was to satirize American lack of awareness about Canada, by interviewing Americans on the street and convincing them to agree with ridiculous statements about their northern neighbour. Mercer freely acknowledged that he did not think Americans were collectively stupid; in an interview on Nightline, Mercer explained that ""I'm just looking for the short answer.

He may eventually decide that there is no safely assured way for him and his inner circle of friends/family to survive his removal from power, so he may order the deployment of a nuclear weapon in Ukraine to introduce just enough chaos into the situation that the West backs off and allows his forces to keep the territory they still occupy. He would do this with the knowledge that the West might well respond in a manner that could get him killed, but he may decide it's worth taking that risk if the alternative is that he will be deposed from power and killed or imprisoned anyway by his own people.

This is why assuming rational leadership is not a safe bet. He may find himself in a situation with his back up against the wall, where the cost of deploying a nuke is no worse than the cost he will already pay either way.

Because let's be real, modern thermonuclear weapons require tritium for the detonators, which only has a half-life of 12ish years, so this has to be regularly maintained and refreshed at great expense using a dedicated reactor. Given the state of the Russian military, I am *totally confident* that these processes have been followed flawlessly for the last 40 years, and that no corners have been cut, money skimmed, and Sergei and Ivan definitly haven't parted out those weapons that are never supposed to be used and sold them for scrap value.

Seize an air bridge with airborne forces, 30% casualties are acceptable just to get boots on the ground, get ground forces in to back them up and solidify gains.

Observers like Hertling are just giving us really grounded commentary, like the objective, verified difficulty in launching a division-sized operation for a week's time without a much longer preparation period and another long rest period afterwards. Based on what they are saying, it would be *shocking* if the force that retook Kharkiv is the same force that is now advancing east from the Oskil River. That's not based on hubris or old-school thinking. That's based on exhaustive modern military exercises and studies done by military experts that led fighting forces much better equipped and trained than the Ukraine Army of today.

No doubt, there's very limited intelligence available to us and probably even people like Hertling. It doesn't mean that Ukraine's advances can't be happening. Clearly, they are. It's just a question of how well prepared this most recent advance is. There was no doubt whatsoever that the initial Kharkiv counter-offensive that recaptured Izyum was a months-long planned and prepared operation. There is doubt of that here with this more recent Oskil offensive. If it's a well prepared one, they will probably penetrate and capture a lot of territory.

The USA will not be needed in Europe, only if Russia is no longer a threat, or if the European Army becomes a reality. None of it is a given.

If Putin stays in power, and/or is replaced with a carbon copy, or even someone worse, then the Russian threat remains. It can get worse. Openly hostile Russia, at a permanent low-level war with NATO, can cause a lot of damage in Europe. Think bombings, assassinations, poisonings, and of course support for extreme political parties. Using its beachhead in Syria to orchestrate migration crises.

Those are challenges that a federal Europe would be able to deal with, but unfortunately it seems further away with the start of the war. Germany and  France, erstwhile leaders of the European project, have lost a massive amount of influence by their tepid response to the invasion. The Eastern Europe will not support integration under their leadership, lest their security will be compromised.

The Europe that requires American help, will make it impossible for the USA to keep Asia in check. It can also lead to an isolationist reaction in the States. Trump can get reelected, GOP can fully embrace the ""America First"" ideology. If America and Europe are at odds, the West is at fraction of its strength.

A completely different scenario I have mentioned, is a use of nuclear weapons that goes unpunished. This would result in a world-wide race to obtain nuclear capability, since it will have been proven to be an effective way to achieve political goals. In such a world, the balance of power would undergo a complete transformation.

What we need, is a clean Ukrainian victory; which leads to a national soul-searching in Russia, and its transformation into a friendly state; or its total collapse, erasing the threat. Then America gets to extract itself from Europe, and go stare down China, thus keeping Asia from going hot.

Frankly, there's a lot we don't know about *the U.S.'s nukes*. 

One of my friends was tangentially involved in his physics professors work on using microwaves to attempt to characterize the (likely radiation accelerated) decomposition of some of the composite materials we use in the warheads. IIRC it wasn't advanced enough to be conclusive at the time. also, IIRC we remove and remanufacture some of ours every so often to hedge against these unknowns (but it is a *small* fraction). I got the vibe from this and other conversations that making sure that all the nukes work all the time is an expense *even the U.S.* can't afford.

However, that said, russia theoretically has 1600 active duty warheads. Even a 1% success rate is 16 targets (military or civilian) wiped off the face of the planet and potentially millions dead. IMHO the only thing worse than that is letting russia do what the want, when they want, because they want.

In essence if you shoot 100 missiles, you draw a circle with the closest group of 50. This doesn't matter too much with a large enough blast, and the circular area probable for most platforms are very small... think cul-de-sac instead of open fields (I'm not getting specific for obvious reasons).

75% of warheads launched will hit something, if not challenged. 

Interception is another animal and heavily dependent on intel. 

You want to be directly infront of what you're shooting down. If you're target window is circular getting a hit is easy. If you're shooting from the side, the vertical part of your window is the same, horizontally it stretches for literal miles. You also need to know it's coming, prepping a system takes a hot crew going downrange to turn on launcher generators and physically turning on thermal batteries that take time to get ready for use. The same applies for offensive missiles with an added difficulty in timing de-synchronised launches to converge simultaneously to overwhelm air defenses. russia leaks like a colander that can't hold noodles so these are good.

If Interception is 90% (spitball as it's a range) accurate, that doesn't dictate 10% get through. There's different firing doctrines to fit different scenarios. Salvo (2 missiles same time), Ripple(2 missiles with a delay), and Shoot Look Shoot (see if the 1st one worked to save ammo).

Missiles are on radar screens for minutes that seem like years, different platforms are capable of overlapping coverage. But this coverage is limited to what assets you want to protect the most.

No, it isn't. That's the opposite of a rational choice. Russia possesses a formidable second strike capability force. Even if NATO would be successful in destroying all their land based nuclear launchers (which is highly unlikely), Russia would still be able to strike back using their submarines. 

And destroying Russia's nuclear infrastructure would certainly be taken as an ""existential threat"" by Russia as defined in their nuclear doctrine, as that means they would have zero actual defense left against any type of incursion, considering the state of their conventional army. 

So taking out their ability to attack, would very possibly trigger them to send nukes with their secondary strike capability.

Stop roleplaying. Russia's nuclear strategy revolves around missiles with enormous payloads. Only one landing successfully would be a humanitarian disaster unseen since the second world war, and no matter what NATO would do - they would very probably be able to land multiple missiles. Even if you take out all their land based silo's in the first strike, Russia will have submarines with nuclear payloads positioned near the US and Europe that will fire in such a scenario.

Attacking Russia proper is exactly the ""existential threat"" that their nuclear doctrine speaks of, and would very likely trigger a nuclear response that **cannot** be stopped by NATO.

No, but there are two important parts to that, the message and the reach of that message. So while the *message* that Girkin conveys is harmful to Putin, the *reach* of that message is not. He does not get primetime airtime. He speaks to a limited audience of milbloggers and hardline Russians that follow Telegram. That is at most 2 million out of 140. It doesn't really move the needle.

So because of that, there is limited incentive to go after Girkin. Especially because Girkin has his own status and authority.

>\- a fortification set mostly below the surface of the ground with overhead protection provided by logs and earth or by concrete and fitted with openings through which guns may be fired.  
>  
>\- Golf. any obstacle, as a sand trap or mound of dirt, constituting a hazard.
