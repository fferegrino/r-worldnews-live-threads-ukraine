Day 122 of my updates from Kharkiv.

That missile attack today was massive, over 50 missiles fired just in the morning alone, that’s way more than they usually fire during the day. Good thing is that not many people got injured from that. One of the targets was a WW2 memorial, why would they even target it, if they love their Victory Day so much? 

They also shelled that small nuclear reactor near me *again,* It’s not too damaged, so it’s not dangerous yet, but what were they even thinking when doing that? I guess if they are fine with digging trenches in Red Forest, then they don’t think that there’s anything wrong with shelling a nuclear reactor. Yesterday they also fired one of their missiles at an already destroyed business centre, the one that they destroyed in the first few weeks of the war, so their target choices are pretty questionable. 

Today, as always, at 11pm and midnight they fired their missiles from Belgorod, explosions were pretty distant for me this time. One of their targets was an apartment complex, the missile completely destroyed part of the roof, and most of the last floor along with it. At least 2 people were injured, it’s not known if anyone died yet. Why would they waste such expensive missiles just to destroy buildings full of civilians? This will only make us hate them even more than we already do.",False,1656210338.0,t3_vk6cek,t3_vk6cek,,0,89,0,89,2,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 June 2022
 

- Ukraine is likely re-configuring its defence of the Sieverodonetsk-Lysychansk sector, as Russian armoured units continue to make creeping gains on the southern edge of the build up area.



- Since the start of June, the Russian high command has highly likely removed several Generals from key operational command roles in the war in Ukraine. These includes the commander of Airborne Forces (VDV) General-Colonel Andrei Serdyukov; and commander Southern Group of Forces (SGF) General of the Army Alexandr Dvornikov. Dvornikov was also for a time probably acting as over-all operational commander.




- Command of the SGF is likely to transfer to Colonel-General Sergei Surovikin, as SGF continues to perform a central part in Russia's offensive in the Donbas. For over thirty years, Surovikin's career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality.

The controlled retreat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Severodonetsk enables the Ukrainian defenders to consolidate in positions where they can better defend themselves.

“I just want to put into context what we're seeing in Severodonetsk in terms of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ managed retrograde from that location,” a senior Pentagon official said at a briefing on June 24.

He suggested looking at the sweep of the past four months: Russia had to completely recalibrate its plans, because its initial plans were overly ambitious and mismanaged, going from their multi-axis attempt that was defeated by the Ukrainians to a focus on Eastern Ukraine.

And really, the Russians are just eking out inch by inch of territory here, the official said.

He noted it's important to reflect on the cost that Russia has paid for this “very small, very incremental gain.”

“So in terms of the situation in Severodonetsk, the way that I view it is the Ukrainian Armed Forces are performing a professional, tactical retrograde in order to consolidate their forces in positions that they can better defend themselves. And I see this as occurring on the heels of their ability to continue to pin down Russian forces over a very long period of time in a very small geographic area,” the representative of the Pentagon said.

On June 24, Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhiy Haidai and journalist Yuriy Butusov reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had been ordered to withdraw from Severodonetsk to a new line of defense.

Ukraine is regrouping its forces from the rubble of the city of Severodonetsk to higher ground in neighbouring Lysychansk to gain a tactical advantage over Russia, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency has said.

In an interview in Kyiv, Kyrylo Budanov, told Reuters news agency that Ukrainian forces would continue their defence of that front from Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine and that it was no longer possible to hold the line in Severodonetsk.

“The activities happening in the area of Severodonetsk are a tactical regrouping of our troops. This is a withdrawal to advantageous positions to obtain a tactical advantage,” said, Budanov, head of the Defence Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

“Russia is using the tactic … it used in Mariupol: wiping the city from the face of the earth. Given the conditions, holding the defence in the ruins and open fields is no longer possible. So the Ukrainian forces are leaving for higher ground to continue the defence operations,” he said.

Asked if he meant Lysychansk, he said: “Yes, this is the only higher ground.”

👉 In the north near Kharkiv the war remains a stalemate with Ukraine forces content to keep the russians away from Kharkiv and to harass the russian supply lines into Izyum.  Meanwhile, the russians are content to secure their borders and keep Ukrainian forces from being used elsewhere.  

👉 In the east Ukrainian command ordered the withdraw from Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.  This was a controlled retreat and there were no mass casualties or captures.   Strategically, the loss of the cities were important only in the sheer number of casualties Ukraine was able to inflict on russians trying to capture the city.   

Ukraine's forces will now be deployed to other defensive positions in the area and while russia may take a few more settlements in cleaning up the salient, they are unlikely to be able to muster enough force to advance further. -- **In military terms we are, in all likelihood, witnessing russia's culmination as it is forced to transition to a defensive posture**.

👉 In the south around Kherson, news remains scarce, though what little we do hear indicates Ukraine is still making slow, steady progress in surrounding Kherson.   There are also pitched battles around Mykolaiv, with artillery battles in and around the city -- so pitched, the mayor has called for everyone to evacuate the city.

👉 The top story in this thread yesterday was that the US Senate had called on russia to be labeled a state sponsor of terrorism, however in actuality the committee studying the issue merely made the recommendation, so this is a very very long ways off from being official US policy.

👉 If you would like more analysis of the impact of the Ukrainian withdraw in the Donbas area, the Institute for the Study of War has [a short, worthwhile read](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1540328739397148676.html).

330k troops total would suggest at most 150k support troops, which would give a tooth-to-tail-ratio (T3R, the number of support troops per combat troop), of 1:0.8, and a combat proportion of 54%.

These are almost unheard of numbers, no army in *centuries* has had a T3R that poor, and that's the supposed *best case scenario*. If the 250k combat troop number was taken, that pushes the T3R down to 1:0.4, or a 76% combat proportion.

For reference, the WW1 T3R was 1:2.6, and WW2 was 1:4.3, i.e. for every combat troop there were at least double that in support troops in WW1, and that was considered an absurdly combat troop heavy war. 1:4 is basically the sustainable minimum. The current US T3R is about 1:10 fighting COIN missions rather than peer adversaries. Cold War readiness against USSR was closer to 1:15.

Complex, but there are multiple factors. The Russians have failed to prepare the VKS for large coordinated actions. There was scant training with combined arms operations. Command and control is terrible. Plus, the Ukrainians have proven to be extraordinary resourceful and adaptive. Keeping their Soviet era defenses mobile has made it difficult to pin them down.

I dunno. Its a pretty obvious strategic advantage to hold a major river-crossing (when its so difficult for the Russians to make sustainable river-crossings on the Donets).

I would have preferred if the Ukrainians held the bridgehead and used Severodonetsk as a launching point for their (eventual) counteroffensive, whenever that occurs.

Still, if Russia really wants those cities and concentrated allegedly 10-to-1 local numerical superiority there, they'll get it. Ukraine obviously didn't want the city as much as Russia did.

With that being said, if Russia truly was sacrificing troops to get the city, it makes sense for Ukraine to retreat while bleeding the Russian army as much as possible. The overall plan is for a counter-offensive to eventually retake all of these areas.

Taking the initiative. French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to maintain a dialogue with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, with no illusions and no snippets of discussion filtering through. A documentary, which will be broadcast on Thursday June 30 on the French channel France 2, lifts part of the veil on these telephone conversations.

The verbatim of one of the last conversations between Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin before the war in Ukraine, four days before the beginning of the invasion, has been revealed. The French president has not yet seen this documentary on the backstage of the Elysee Palace and negotiations conducted in close quarters, between tutelage, annoyance and incongruities. In this exchange, the head of state proposes to the Russian president a meeting ""in the next few days"" in Geneva with Joe Biden. It will never take place.

The verbatim

Emmanuel Macron:

Since our last conversation tensions have continued to grow and you know my commitment and determination to continue the dialogue. I would like you to give me first your reading of the situation and perhaps in a rather direct way, as we both do, tell me what your intentions are. And then I wanted to try to see if there were still useful actions to be taken and make some proposals to you.

Vladimir Putin:

What can I say? You can see for yourself what is going on. You and Chancellor Scholz told me that Zelensky was ready to make a move, that he had prepared a bill to implement the Minsk agreements [...] in fact our dear colleague, Mr. Zelensky, is doing nothing. He is lying to you [...] I don't know if you heard his statement yesterday where he said that Ukraine must have access to atomic weapons.

(diplomatic adviser Emmanuel Bonne: no, that's nonsense)

I also heard your comments at the press conference in Kiev on February 8. You said that the Minsk agreements must be revised, and I quote, ""so that they can be implemented.

(Macron's advisors: ""no, he didn't say that"", ""I'll tell him not to get into a detailed discussion with him"").

Emmanuel Macron:

Vladimir, first of all one thing, I never said that the Minsk agreements should be revised. I never said that in Berlin, in Kiev or in Paris. I said that they should be applied, that things should be respected and I do not have the same reading of the last few days as you do.

Vladimir Putin:

Look Emmanuel, I don't understand your problem with the separatists. At least they did everything right, under our insistence, to open a constructive dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities.

Emmanuel Macron:

Regarding what you said, Vladimir, several remarks: first, the Minsk agreements are a dialogue with you, you are absolutely right. In this context, the basis for discussion is not a text submitted by the separatists. And so when your negotiator tries to force the Ukrainians to discuss on the basis of roadmaps of the separatists, he is not respecting the Minsk agreements. It is not separatists who are going to make proposals on Ukrainian laws!

Vladimir Putin:

Of course we have a completely different reading of the situation. During our last meeting, I reminded you and even read articles 9, 11 and 12 of the Minsk agreements.

Emmanuel Macron:

I have them in front of me! It is clearly written that the Government of Ukraine - paragraph 9 etc. - proposes, and that it is in consultation and agreement with the representatives of certain districts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, within the framework of the tripartite contact group. This is exactly what we propose to do. So I don't know where your lawyer learned the law (a counselor smiles). I just look at the texts and try to apply them! And I don't know which lawyer will be able to tell you that in a sovereign country, the laws are proposed by separatist groups and not by the democratically elected authorities.

Vladimir Putin:
(firm and annoyed tone) This is not a democratically elected government. They came to power in a coup, people were burned alive, it was a bloodbath, and Zelensky is one of those responsible.

Listen to me: the principle of dialogue is to take into account the interests of the other side. The proposals exist, the separatists, as you call them, have passed them on to the Ukrainians, but they have not received any answer. Where is the dialogue?

Emmanuel Macron:

But because, as I just told you, we don't care about the separatists' proposals. What we are asking them to do is to react to the texts of the Ukrainians, and we must do things in that direction because that is the law! What you have just said casts doubt on your own willingness to respect the Minsk agreements if you judge that you are facing non-legitimate and terrorist authorities.

Vladimir Putin:

(still very annoyed) Listen to me carefully. Do you hear me? I'm telling you again that the separatists, as you call them, have reacted to the proposals of the Ukrainian authorities. They responded but these same authorities did not follow up.

Emmanuel Macron:

So okay: on the basis of their response to the Ukrainian texts, what I propose is that we demand from all parties a meeting within the framework of the contact group to continue to move forward. Tomorrow we can ask for this work to be done and demand that all parties involved do not have an empty chair policy. However, over the last two days the separatists have not wanted to take part in this discussion. I am going to demand this of Zelensky. Do we agree on this? If we agree, I will launch it and demand a meeting tomorrow.

Vladimir Putin:

So just to be clear, as soon as we hang up, I will study these proposals. But from the beginning we should have put pressure on the Ukrainians, but no one wanted to do so.

Emmanuel Macron:

But if I do my utmost to push them, you know that.

Vladimir Putin:

I know, but unfortunately it is not effective.

Emmanuel Macron:

I need you to help me a little (mischievously). The situation on the contact line is very tense. I really called yesterday for Zelensky to calm down. I will tell him again, calm everyone, calm in social networks, calm the Ukrainian armed forces. But what I also see, you can really call to calm your pre-positioned armed forces. There was a lot of bombing yesterday. If we want to give dialogue a chance, we need to calm down the game in the region. How do you see the evolution of the military exercises?

Vladimir Putin:

The exercises are going according to plan.

Emmanuel Macron:

So they end tonight, right?

Vladimir Putin:

Yes probably tonight and we will certainly leave a military presence on the border until the situation in Donbass calms down. The discussion will be taken in consultation with the defense and foreign ministries.

Emmanuel Macron:

Okay. Vladimir, I say to you very sincerely, for me to put the discussions in the right framework and avoid tensions is an absolute prerequisite. And what is important to me, and I am really asking you to do this, is that the situation be brought under control. That's the first pillar. And I count on you a lot. Don't give in to any provocation in the hours and days to come.

I wanted to make two concrete proposals to you. The first is to organize a meeting in the next few days in Geneva between you and President Biden. I spoke to him on Friday evening and asked him if I could make this proposal to you. He told me to tell you that he was ready. President Biden has also been thinking about ways to credibly de-escalate the situation, to take into account your demands and to address very clearly the issue of NATO and Ukraine. Tell me the date that suits you.

Vladimir Putin:

Thank you very much Immanuel. It is always a great pleasure and honor to talk with your European counterparts as well as with the United States. And I always have great pleasure in dialoguing with you because we have a relationship of trust. So Emmanuel, I propose to you to reverse things. First of all, you have to prepare this meeting in advance. It's only afterwards that we can talk because if we come here like this, to talk about everything and nothing, we'll be blamed again.

Once they were within about 30 miles of the Ukrainian border, the agency said, they fired at least 12 cruise missiles before returning to Russian airspace. The missiles struck targets in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the military said.

Russians, ever since they were still the Soviet Union, relied on a central point of radar guidance to get their planes and interceptors vector information to perform intercepts and other operations vitally necessary for establishing and maintaining overall air superiority.   Unlike the western air forces, whose pilots are encouraged to develop their own plans, identify, attack and react independently of such higher-rank guidance, Russian pilots are trained to be reliant on this information and operational direction.

This is great when you're performing in a defensive mode, since the enemy is bringing the fight to you.   However, when you are (a) unable to guarantee you have aerial or ground-based radar coverage everywhere in your sphere of operations, and (b) your opposition is doing it's utmost to hinder or disrupt your ability to detect them, either through tactical means (ultra-low flying, careful timing/targe/approach selection) or electronic-based hindrances such as jamming, you're stuck with a bunch of fighters drawing dicks in the air, and not much else.

This is why losing the Moskva was such a blow in the southern theater - they lost a major radar/control asset that they had believed was safe and protected.   Now that the Moskva has joined the great Black Sea submarine fleet, the Russians are desperately trying to use Snake Island as an ad hoc replacement.

Ukraine cannot hold back Russia indefinitely where it is concentrated (At least not without months more build-up of NATO precision artillery and the needed training) but they're doing a great job of slowing Russian progress and grinding them down. The goal is not to hold the donbas indefinitely but to make Russia spend far more lives and ammo taking it than Ukraine spends defending it.

While this means a slow, temporary surrender of the east. The big picture is that Ukraine has shown a clear capability to retake territory in areas where Russia is not concentrated (Kharkiv, Kherson). Russia's initial strategy of pushing everywhere has created a huge line of contact to defend, and they simply cannot defend it all. That makes these expensive gains in the donbas a tactical victory in the short term but a big strategic waste in the long term.

91571923ecea451ea362a2ead42cc6dd,vk6cek,idqh60r,"I had to think about this, because how you answer the question depends a bit. *Permanently* losing ground, means a loss. Definetly. 

Still, pretty much every military historian that isn't Russian agree that Finland won a decisive military victory over the USSR in the Winter War, because by any measuring device, the USSR was expected to completely militarily dominate Finland and indeed absorb the country fully, for it to stop existing as an entity. Instead Finland inflicted horrendous losses on the USSR armed forces almost without parallel in history, given the disparity between forces. They prevented the destruction of their nation, and ""all"" they had to cede was a in comparison pretty limited land mass. It did however constitute a localized loss. It would have been even better if they had not had to cede any territory, so at least the theoretical possibility of a better result, a ""win"" exists 

&nbsp;

But here...its almost impossible to class it as a local loss, not yet. In an ongoing manouver war, using terrain and land is a commanders privilege, asset and tool. Trading land for time or to exhaust enemies is a valid military tactic. Drawing an enemy that is stronger locally into a salient or killing field, or even letting yourself be surrounded intentionally in order to put the opposing side in a situation where you can multiply your force applied to them by concentrating artillery, air power in a situation where your fortified positions gives you the defenders advantages and him the attackers losses, isnt just a valid tactic. Its one that has been heavy used for a few hundred years now.

So if you use tactics like this to exhaust enemy military assets like hardware, manpower, supplies, and that later leads to you regaining that territory, it was never a negative or localized loss at all. If it later ends with the attacker gaining less that their goal but a loss of the local site, it was probably a strategic victory with a localized loss. And if it ends with you losing everything, it probably was a mistake or the odds must have been overwhelming to a point it was not possible to win.

&nbsp;

Right now; its impossible to say which it was. I lean toward it not being a loss, but rather a planned move, but thats my subjective asessment. I base that on this salient coming into existance fairly slowly, that the Ukrainians generated a lot of artillery capacity there that was not dislodged quickly by Russia, so it must have been prepared and fortified positions, and that the Ukrainians when they pulled out seems to have been able to do so in a very controlled fasion. It was by no means a rout, and that indicates them controlling the situation fairly well. So my guess is they had looked for an opportunity to present a juicy target to the Russians to pull them into a meatgrinder, and when they felt it no longer gave a satisfying loss/win ratio in terms of kills, they shut it down as they had planned.

&nbsp;

The correct answer is for military historians to figure out. Not me. But to say that 

>losing ground isn't good war.

is directly wrong I think. The minute you start thinking any ground loss is a negative, you've handed the enemy a very useful tool against you. Predictability and fixed positions.",1656194121.0,1656193732.0,t3_vk6cek,t1_idq4xe5,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Which is why I brought up WWII. Germany took most of Europe, but it was taken back. This was war on a huge scale, against an enemy that had already overrun a vast territory.

Russia is struggling to take one small part of one single country. The scale is vastly different.

>Not without a fuck ton more weapons pouring into Ukraine. They are just trickling in at this rate. It’s not enough to turn the tides.

The war's not over yet? Heavy weapons deliveries have just gotten started, and not all of them are being announced. Specifically, it was announced that the specifics of Lend-Lease were going to be kept between the parties involved. So you are basing your statements on incomplete information.

Only 140 billion of the defence budget is for weapons procurement, and that procurement is mostly high-tech weapons. It's not possible to find out stockpiles but we can look at how much of something like artillery rounds is procured on a yearly basis.

In 2020, artillery ammunition purchases decreased by 36% to $425 million. In 2022, the plan is to reduce expenditure on 155mm artillery rounds to $174 million. US annual artillery production would at best only last for 10 days to two weeks of combat in Ukraine.

As you say use or lose it. The US is not set up to crank out huge numbers of these weapons. We can see this with Javelins as an example.

America has given Ukraine approx 7,000 Javelins which is 1/3 of its entire stockpile. The US produces 2,100 a year. Doubling that production to 4,000 could years according to the CEO of Lockheed-Martin Jim Taiclet

>We’re endeavoring to take that up to 4,000 per year, and that will take a number of months, maybe even a couple of years to get there because we have to get our supply chain to also crank up

All of this to say the US does not have a huge industrial base to procure the numbers of weapons needed in the type of industrial war we are seeing in Ukraine. The majority of the defence budget is spent on personnel(salaries, child care, education, VA etc), airpower and sea power, maintenance and modernization of nuclear weapons and R&D.  These supply chains are complicated and can't be easily ramped up in ""peacetime"".

Ukraine had some success with drones during the first phase of the war when Russia was conducting large-scale manoeuvre operations, but these kinds of drones are not meant to defeat modern air defence. The Bayraktar for example is designed with a low-cost to high lethality ratio in mind to fight groups in the middle east. They did have some success in Syria overwhelming Russian S-300 systems, but the Russian will have layered air defence with early warning systems etc.

The Ukrainians themselves know the limitations of such systems, so I don't think we will see a lot of success with drones going forward.

Some people are discovering now that missiles targeting Ukraine come from Belarus soooooo ...

>What's being said is that Putin is trying to do something to push the Belarusians into being more enthusiastic about supporting the war effort.

The average belarusians want their country to embrace the EU as we all have seen when Lukașenko was ""reelected"" and everyone started protesting. We also have seen that they have zero chances to overthrow their government because they actually tried to do that and failed (secret police/special forces beating poor protestors, you name it)

Only the elder and poorly educated will get on that propaganda train. If Belarus tries to enter UA with troops it will be 100% political suicide. ATM Russia is doing well with just using Belarus as a launch pad for missiles. 

While I understand your point I believe that Russia has more to lose than win if Belarus will invade Ukraine. So no, I don't think that this will happen in the near future at all.",False,1656199419.0,t3_vk6cek,t1_idqrk9g,,9,2,0,2,0,0,
