Day 31 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Intense fighting has been going on all throughout the day, a lot of gun fights and artillery working almost non-stop, not that much incoming shelling. What is interesting though is that instead of leaving people are RETURNING. Today the streets were packed, people going for walks, some sitting on benches, queues for humanitarian aid are extremely long. You have to stand in one for around 6 hours if you aren‚Äôt one of the first people lining up.

A lot of people are probably returning because my district is largely untouched while downtown and Saltivka are mostly destroyed, so some of them just moved here for the time being. People are so used to this war that they don‚Äôt even flinch when hearing guns being fired not that far away. No matter how much fighting is happening around them they just stand in queue to the store like it‚Äôs nothing.

Now the worst thing today is that apparently a nuclear reactor in a research institute has been shelled, staff can‚Äôt confirm the extent of damage as there‚Äôs active fighting happening around it. What is even worse is that this nuclear reactor is only around 3-4 km away from my home, so it would be real nice if they stopped trying to cause fucking nuclear fallout around here.

>At bottom of Kremlin's neurotic view of world affairs is traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity. Originally, this was insecurity of a peaceful agricultural people trying to live on vast exposed plain in neighborhood of fierce nomadic peoples. To this was added, as Russia came into contact with economically advanced West, fear of more competent, more powerful, more highly organized societies in that area. But this latter type of insecurity was one which afflicted rather Russian rulers than Russian people; for Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned truth about world without or if foreigners learned truth about world within.

It *is* probably true though.

I had said this as a response on the locked thread right before it was locked, but I'm going to leave it as a top-level comment so I can stop having to say the same thing over and over again.

Biden's statement today was NOT a misspeak.  There was nothing Biden said that he didn't mean exactly like you want to interpret it.  That was the ENTIRE point of the statement.  See this guy, Putin I think his name is, is a bully.  He likes to threaten everyone and their brother, and as long as everyone keeps saying 'cool it Vlady ol' boy, it's all cool', he will KEEP threatening.

Vlady doesn't give a FUCK about his soldiers.  He doesn't give a FUCK about his people.  He cares about HIS power.   He cares about HIS life.  What Biden did today was to scare the ever living fuck out of Putin.  Now Putin has an extra nightmare to think about when he goes to bed.  Something else to consider.  I mean, how could the US President say such a thing.  Western leaders aren't permitted to have those thoughts in public!

And this is why the Whitehouse will walk it back.  They will walk it back for diplomatic consumption, but have no doubt the message was received very loudly and clearly by the intended audience.  Finally someone has pushed back on the bully on something that the bully ACTUALLY cares about.  In the press and at the UN it will be said 'we didn't mean that, etc.' so everyone doesn't think the US has gone deep-end, but I guarantee you that speech was revisited over and over again before being given.  I guarantee the Whitehouse staff had the walk-back lines already prepared.

If anyone here thinks Biden gave a casual off the cuff speech today with that content you really are hyper na√Øve.  Biden is a lot of things, but he is experienced and he knows EXACTLY what he said, that he shouldn't say that, and conversely he HAD to say it.  Some times the wrong thing is the right choice.  This choice was undoubtedly discussed with more people than will even read my comment here.  There is a reason it was made and was made today.  I don't know specifically what that reason is, but time will undoubtedly make it very clear.",1648330581.0,1648330486.0,t3_tp4393,t3_tp4393,,0,194,0,194,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

Yes you heard that right for the past 20 years the head of the Russian army has never really been active in the army.

The current Russian minister of D√©fense, Sergei Shoigu is a regular politician with a background as a civil engineer and has never seen combat

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei\_Shoigu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu)

Nevertheless Putin not only made him the minister of Defense but also a general in the Russia army! 

The guy before him was named Anatoly Serdyukov. He studied economics and worked as furniture salesman and only had one year of mandatory army service.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly\_Serdyukov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Serdyukov)

The Russian army didn't like this guy at all

>On 15 February 2007, President Vladimir Putin appointed Serdyukov as Defense Minister of the Russian Federation, with the main task of fighting corruption and inefficiency in the Russian armed forces.\[4\] This started the conflict, that would last through Serdyukov time as Defense Minister with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation since General Staff considered appointment of a civilian, with no remarkable military background and former furniture dealer as an insult. To sharpen the conflict, Head of General Staff at the time Yuri Baluyevsky demanded that the new defence minister would have to spend 1 month in General Staff at ""preparation training"" to have an idea of the ""job in hand"". On 14 September 2007, Serdyukov offered his resignation to the president over family relations with Viktor Zubkov, but this resignation was not accepted.\[5\] However before Putin responded, Baluyevsky did support publicly the resignation of Serdyukov and stated that ""the next defence minister could be a woman"". In Russian cultural context, this is an insult, not sign of progressive and liberal thinking. After Putin rejected resignation of Serdyukov, Serdyukov retaliated by organising an audit and inspection how the senior members of General Staff did manage with the mandatory physical requirements test for armed forces members. Most of them failed and hence created a storm in a Russian media.\[6\]

The guy before that was a kgb officer who worked mostly in embassies but happened to know Putin.

A nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been hit by Russian shelling, according to authorities cited in a Ukrainian news outlet.

The Kyiv Independent said because of constant shelling in the area, in the north east of the country, authorities have been unable to assess the damage to the site.

Russia has been repeatedly criticised for targeting nuclear power plants in Ukraine, such as the Zhaporizhia nuclear plant in the south east.

**Putin has hired assassins/ the Wagner group to murder Zelenskyy.**

Putin interfered in US elections, and other elections for decades. This is known as efforts of ‚Äúregime change‚Äù.

From the Washington Post:

*We identified two waves of Russian meddling since the early 1990s.* ***The first wave lasted until 2014 and targeted only post-Soviet countries. Since then, a second wave has expanded dramatically into established Western democracies.***  
*\[‚Ä¶\]*  
*First wave: In the former Soviet states, 1991 to 2014*  
*Shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia began to interfere in elections of the countries that had been part of the U.S.S.R. Many observers have argued that Russia sought to promote authoritarianism. In fact, its goal wasn‚Äôt primarily to undermine democracy but to support pro-Russian candidates. Indeed, in some cases, as in Ukraine in 1994, Russia inadvertently bolstered pluralism by trying to undermine anti-Russian autocrats.*  
*In Moscow, candidates opposed to Putin are running ‚Äî and winning. Here‚Äôs why that matters.*  
*Russian interference also frequently failed. Despite Russia‚Äôs power in the region, only four of 11 cases of interference turned out in Russia‚Äôs favor. Only once ‚Äî in Ukraine in 1994 ‚Äî is there plausible evidence that Russian intervention was decisive. There, Russian television gave the pro-Russian opposition candidate for Ukraine‚Äôs presidency significant media exposure that he would have otherwise lacked.*  
*Second wave: in Western democracies, 2014 to now*  
*In the past three years,* ***Russian interference has expanded into such countries as the United States, Germany, France and Britain, among others. These efforts have ranged widely. For instance, to prevent Montenegro from joining NATO, the Kremlin likely sponsored an October 2016 coup attempt.***  *In a number of European countries, Russia helped fund far-right parties such as the National Front in the run-up to France‚Äôs 2017 election.*

https://mobile.twitter.com/RALee85/status/1507867673211944967

White phosphorus:

> White phosphorus burns at a temperature of up to 2,760 degrees Celsius (5,000 degrees Fahrenheit). Incandescent particles from weapons using powdered white phosphorus as their payload produce extensive partial- and full-thickness burns, as will any attempt to handle burning submunitions without protective equipment. Phosphorus burns carry an increased risk of mortality due to the absorption of phosphorus into the body through the burned area with prolonged contact, which can result in liver, heart and kidney damage, and in some cases multiple organ failure. White phosphorus particles continue to burn until completely consumed unless deprived of oxygen. In the case of weapons using felt-impregnated submunitions, incomplete combustion may occur resulting in up to 15% of the WP content remaining unburned. Such submunitions can prove hazardous as they are capable of spontaneous re-ignition if crushed by personnel or vehicles. In some cases, injury is limited to areas of exposed skin because the smaller WP particles do not burn completely through personal clothing before being consumed.
> 
> Due to the pyrophoric nature of WP, penetrating injuries are immediately treated by smothering the wound using water, damp cloth or mud, isolating it from oxygen until fragments can be removed: military forces will typically do so using a bayonet or knife where able. Bicarbonate solution is applied to the wound to neutralise any build-up of phosphoric acid, followed by removal of any remaining visible fragments: these are easily observed as they are luminescent in dark surroundings. Surgical debridement around the wound is used to avoid fragments too small to detect causing later systemic failure, with further treatment proceeding as with a thermal burn

White phosphorus munitions have been used extensively throughout history.

For all America‚Äôs success in helping Ukraine, hard times lie ahead Joe Biden must hold together a fractious coalition

Vladimir putin‚Äôs epoch-changing miscalculation over Ukraine was the outcome of a trio of mission-defining misjudgments. One was that Ukraine‚Äôs government would collapse quickly. Another was that his modernised army would be dominant. The last was that America, in irreversible decline, was no longer capable of leadership. For Ukraine to be defeated, Mr Putin had only to get one premise right.

The first two misjudgments have caused general surprise. The third has stirred up general interest, among allies and foes alike. In recent years America has seemed less committed to the institutions it created after the second world war, largely as a result of its own disastrous occupation of Iraq following the attacks of September 11th 2001. Barack Obama chose to ‚Äúreset‚Äù relations with Russia after it invaded Georgia in 2008 and failed to enforce a red line against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Donald Trump accused his allies of duping America and called nato ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù. After America‚Äôs humiliating flight from Kabul last summer, Mr Putin seemed to have concluded that Joe Biden would be unable or unwilling to do much for Ukraine.

Today, as Mr Biden lands in Europe for NATO, G7 and EU summits, it is clear that America has confounded Mr Putin by being innovative, agile and resolute (see United States section). It ¬≠understands that the security of Europe is at stake in Ukraine. The question is whether that success can survive the tests that lie ahead. At home, destructive political partisanship is once more rearing its head. In Europe, the coalition that America so carefully stitched together is beginning to fray.

America‚Äôs innovation began before the war, with the unpre¬≠cedented release of intelligence. Along with Britain, the Biden administration issued detailed, up-to-the-minute warnings about Russian troops massing on Ukraine‚Äôs borders, would-be provocations, the plan of attack and a blueprint for a puppet government. This robbed Mr Putin of the power to disorientate that served him so well in the seizure of Crimea in 2014. The supply has continued in battle. Information from intercepted communications, ¬≠NATO aircraft and satellites is rapidly given to Ukrainian forces, who use it for targeting.

The agility was on display when America changed course in the opening phase of the war. Mr Putin was not alone in thinking that Kyiv would fall within days. The Biden administration offered Volodymyr Zelensky safe passage out of the capital. Ukraine‚Äôs president vowed to stay even as his forces repelled Russian paratroopers. America and its allies responded with more weapons and fresh sanctions.

And NATO has demonstrated resolve. In 2019 Emmanuel Macron, France‚Äôs president, warned that it was suffering ‚Äúbrain death‚Äù. Today it is reinforcing its eastern flank. Germany, its second-wealthiest member, has overturned decades of timid defence policy by agreeing to give Ukraine arms and pledging to increase spending. In its wholehearted leadership of NATO, American diplomacy has recovered from the lows of the Trump years.

The fact that the war has lasted so long is an endorsement of Mr Biden‚Äôs support. But, as it drags on, sustaining that support is becoming harder. At home some Republicans have taken to blaming Mr Biden for the war, arguing however implausibly that the real cause of the invasion was Kabul and American acquiescence over a German gas pipeline coming from Russia. They accuse Mr Biden of being weak. In the long run, partisanship is a grave threat to American influence abroad. Mr Biden‚Äôs best riposte to his critics is to throw his efforts into dealing with the other, far more urgent political problem, which lies in Europe. This is the first sign of weariness in the coalition helping Ukraine withstand the Russian army (see Europe section).

Ukraine says it is short of arms. There have been pledges, including this week from Britain, but supplies could arrive too late. Ukraine also complains that NATO‚Äôs distinction between defensive weapons, such as anti-tank missiles, and offensive weapons, such as aircraft, is meaningless when the invader is bent on destruction. Diplomatic sources accuse Germany and Hungary, in particular, of standing in the way of extra sanctions. All this is becoming an urgent problem. Mariupol, a city with a population of 400,000 before the invasion, is being razed to the ground by Russian artillery. Civilians, including children, have been deported to Russia. Mr Biden has warned that Mr Putin may be about to order the use of chemical or biological weapons. As Russian atrocities mount, Ukraine will need more help. When Mr Biden meets European heads of government he will have to stiffen their resolve. If he fails to unite his allies, his good work will have been squandered. ‚ñ†",False,1648330783.0,t3_tp4393,t3_tp4393,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

""Am I wrong in saying that before Trump, US politicians mostly accepted the decisions of elected presidents, regardless of their party affiliation?""

My answer: 

  
Both parties prior to Obama were mostly old white guys who all profited off the suffering of minorities and had undocumented housekeepers and 'exotic' mistresses, paid 'migrant workers' (i.e. slaves) nothing to harvest farms and outsourced their slavery overseas while effectively suppressing the vote with gerrymandering and pretended everything was fine.

  
Obama becoming president made that harder to do, more minorities began to gain power and this is ALL the white people converting to GOP racist stuff so they can go back to that day and pretend again - ""Make America Great"" always seems to focus on how everything was fantastic in the 50s before change made it possible to challenge the male white supremacist Christian majority that dominated both parties.

  
Now we are in a full-blown ideological war where people of color, women, LGBTQ organizations, Climate Change activists are all gaining enough power to form the other side of the ballot and fight back.

  
It has always been this outrageous - watch how long it took us to get into WWII and the fact that we put Japanese citizens in internment camps.

  
Now there would be actual outrage about that choice, whereas before, both parties said ""Well, sure, they're not white, so what do I care?""

Biden might not be the best at everything, but the man has a good heart and knows right from wrong and that's so unpalatable to some that of course he's being buried in shit by both the GOP and his own party that would want him to not expend political capital on Ukraine instead of the glory of the Democratic Party.",False,1648328940.0,t3_tp4393,t3_tp4393,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

> 
> March 25 (Reuters) - China's state-run Sinopec Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine.
> 
> The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions.
> 
> Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion.
> 
> But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.
> 
> Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture with Russian gas producer Novatek (NVTK.MM) over concerns that Sberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S. sanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter.

So Russia could launch attacks or resupply without ever putting themselves at risk (if Ukraine attacked Russian soil, they might escalate a lot more than they have so far). But it's also in-between Krasnopilya and Ukraine held Velyka Pysarivka, so they could link those three cities and cut off everything southeast of Sumy (which admittedly isn't a lot, but it will create a decent buffer line).

......

> The official results published by the Central Election Commission of Belarus gave Tsikhanouskaya 588,622 votes, or 10.12% of the vote, to Lukashenko's 80.10%. However, allegations of wide-spread fraud were immediately made public, including a formal complaint to the Central Election Commission (CEC) by Tsikhanouskaya.

....

> On 26 February 2022, in response to the Belarus participation in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Tsikhanouskaya posted a tweet stating ""‚Ä¶I declared myself as the national leader of Belarus to protect the sovereignty & independence of our country, represent it in security negotiations & crisis management in the region"", and mentioned that she ""will create a transitional cabinet"", after claiming that ""Belarus has lost its independence"" and alleged President ""Lukashenka committed high treason"" in the video in the tweet. On March 2 2022 Tsihanouskaya announced anti-war mobilisation and posted a manifesto of the anti-war movement calling Belarusians to oppose Russian invasion in Ukraine and imploring Belarusian soldiers to refuse to participate in the war.

Russian here, hope I don't mess too much detail up.

Russia practices conscription, meaning a lot of people have gone through military service in one way or form. At the end of that service, they're not entirely free, but are moved into reserve. In the vast majority of cases, you simply go back to your civilian life and forget about the military for good; in some cases, though, there are drill/exercises type events that take around a month (not too sure here), but again, I don't think the majority of the reservists go though that.

Having all that in mind, the Russian army reserve is actually pretty massive, although we have to realize that it doesn't mean they're all combatants. Not to mention the fact that actually drafting the entire reserve is actually even dumber than the entire invasion (especially after it's been a disgusting and criminal failure for a month now) because Russia does have a massive territory that absolutely nobody will ever leave completely defenseless.

They were joined by US President Joseph Biden. As I was informed, the talks concerned, in particular, these vital interests, which I mentioned above. We talked about what we really need while this ping-pong continues - who and how should give us planes and other protection tools. Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles from shotguns, from machine guns, which are too much in supply.
> 
> And it is impossible to unblock Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft. All defenders of Ukraine know about it. All defenders of Mariupol know. Thousands of people know - citizens, civilians who die there in the blockade.

A little off-topic but I think one of the reasons things have run so far off with rails with conspiracy theories and 'my beliefs' is because there hasn't been anything REAL to be afraid of for two whole generations, so people took advantage of that to introduce false fears.

When I was young we had an 'enemy'.  For right or for wrong we 'knew' who the 'bad guy' was (yes often times we might have been the bad guy, but it didn't matter).  It was polarizing and unifying for entire generations.  Then sudden we 'won' and the 'bad guy' lost.  Enter two generations with no 'common goal', no 'common enemy'.  Instead it has been replace with various factions and pockets infighting with each other and actually destabilizing the structures and societies that 'won'.

No one wants to see a nuclear war, but I don't know that knowing one is possible is a bad thing.  For the record, it was ALWAYS possible.  You just never realized it.  When people would talk about it many people lacking a frame of reference would shout retorts that hinted at ignorance they would never admit.  I see it in these threads too, the howling at the moon of nuclear war.  I am convinced that part of the reason this is even back on the radar is because everyone stopped caring about it and efforts to control nuclear arms fell by the wayside. (I would site the Iran deal as an example.  A deal that was working according to international monitors was abandoned because... reasons).  Both India and Pakistan have been allowed to proliferate their nuclear arsenals with very little care from most of the world... maybe being scared of nuclear war again is a 'good thing' for society.

If my assumption is correct, it's the cringiest, trashiest, tactless fucking thing they could do.


> Oscars co-host Amy Schumer is ‚Äúnot afraid‚Äù to address the war in Ukraine at this year‚Äôs ceremony. In fact, the comedian recently revealed she wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to be part of the show.


Get the fuck out of here, clearly it's all about driving the ratings up for the show and nothing else.


They want Zelensky, a man who has escaped assassination who knows how many times and has seen his people dying literally every day for weeks now, to ""speak"" at the Oscars to a room full of millionaires and people who don't really have that much to worry about in life?


He'd probably grill the ever-living fuck out of them and ask them to do more, which to be fair, I'm sure would be *great* for uncomfortable/cringe compilations, but even if he wasn't that pushy, what? He'd give a great speech/message, there would be a standing ovation and shots of people with tears running down their face.... and then what?


Back to the usual.


At least Ashton and Mila raised more than 30m$.


I'm sorry for being a downer but this sincerely just feels like desperate move to bait people into watching the Oscars. That's all it is.


And in the off-chance that it isn't, and that there are actually good intentions behind it, it's extremely dangerous in my humble opinion to do it this way, cause they're almost turning the whole segment into a piece of entertainment.


Again, just my opinion, but there's a time and a place and the Oscars sure ain't it, especially with how increasingly out of touch they've gotten over the last few years.


Organize a fundraiser on the side and have the big shots attending give money to it or something, but trying to get Zelensky to come on just feels like a disgusting thing to ask of him considering the situation.


I get it he was an actor and all, but that doesn't seem like an ok thing to do.


And for the record, this isn't at all a ""muh Oscars"" rant because I won't even be watching it this year, but I just can't stand shit like this:

""I hope that Drone that crashed in Croatia yesterday will not cause article 5 to be declared. It crashed into nato territory technically""

or

How would Nato react if Chinese troops landed in Poland overnight to assist in Ukraine for Russia obviously

or ""Any chance the Drone crash in Croatia could trigger article 5, especially if it‚Äôs a Russian Drone?""

or

"" How would the tanks the Russians are using (t-72, t-55) fair against a M1 Abrahams or the German Leopard tank? ....Way to quick to dismiss the t-55. They‚Äôve been upgraded since then""

or

Watching the Russians get closer to Kiev city limits is like watching the Russians get to Berlin during WW2.

or

I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, there is no reason why we can‚Äôt turn car dealerships and old warehouses/factories hear into tank plants to produce the t-55 and t-72‚Äôs Ukraine needs to win this war.

We did it during WW2 we can do it today we just need the will to do it. Unfortunately Biden is to controlled by special interests like a puppet and won‚Äôt do an executive order to help the Ukrainian people.

OR 11 Days ago.....

UK military intelligence believes there were five encirclements of ukrainian forces on the 5th. This is really bad hopefully those Ukrainian army groups can do a break out or else this may be a turning point in the war.

Source this time for clarity

Or

Biden looked and sounded like a weak leader. I get that he has a stutter but my god I had to turn it off after the first few minutes. The stuttering and rambling on the major lines of delivery is like listening to chalk streak against a chalk board.

All momentum that could have been created tonight is gone now. This speech had the potential to be historic and Biden Ruins it by not being able to speak clearly and coherently

Everyone in my household aswell as my friends all agreed it was to hard to watch.

Shame because Ukraine really needs total support of the west right now..

Or the cherry on top

This entire thing is so overblown it‚Äôs laughable. There will be no invasion Russia not going to invade a us ally.

All this panic over nothing when our attention should be on what is going on at our own southern border right now which is 10x more of a pressing issue for not only the us but for the global world.

> **Russian army sold recruits for sex, rights group claims**
> 
> Luke Harding in Moscow
> Tue 13 Feb 2007 19.03 EST
> 
> Russia's scandal-prone military was gripped by allegations yesterday that cash-strapped senior officers had forced young conscripts to work as male prostitutes.
> 
> According to the rights group Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, conscripts at an army base in St Petersburg were compelled to perform sexual services for influential middle-aged clients, among whom was a former general in the FSB intelligence agency.
> 
> Clients were said to arrive at night outside the military base, next to the Hermitage museum, and the soldiers would be forced to get into clients' cars.
> 
> One conscript, who had raised the alarm, told Russia's Gazeta newspaper yesterday that older soldiers humiliated the others. ""Sometimes they made us mop the floors all night ... The officers would beat us on the arms and legs. We were sent out to the park to earn money ... I was tortured with electric shocks."" Another conscript added: ""At least 10 out of 35 of us would not spend the nights at the military base.""
> 
> The allegations involving St Petersburg's unit of 3,727 personnel follow cases of abuse of conscripts. Last year there was national outrage at the gruesome fate of Andrei Sychev, 19, a tank academy conscript so badly tortured by his superiors his genitals and legs had to be amputated.
> 
> Russian media reports claim soldiers at the St Petersburg unit passed a ""client list"" on to successors, and conscripts were paid about 1,000 roubles (¬£20) for sex.
> 
> Yesterday, Vasily Panchenkov, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said: ""This is merely an anti-army campaign designed by the [Soldiers' Mothers] committees. The unit is constantly checked.""
> 
> Human rights groups are concerned about what they call systemic bullying in the army, still made up overwhelmingly of conscripts. Valentina Melnikova, of the soldiers' mothers committees, said: ""The reason these cases are so hard to prove is that everybody stays silent in the army.""

""Casualties"" adds everything together. Killed, wounded, surrendered, incapacitated etc. which gives us a much higher number. If the number of killed is 10k then the number of casualties would be something like 40k.

The obvious reason is the Russian intrusion into Crimea and Donbas.  That was Putin's mistake that moved Ukraine decisively toward Europe and democratization and to fuck Putin.  Putin's second mistake in cementing this move on the part of Ukraine was the current invasion.

So I'm sorry, this is largely just more bullshit about how Ukraine ""provoked"" Putin by refusing to stay under his/Russian yoke. And, yes, the West/US took advantage.  Blaming Ukraine, as much of this ""realistic"" analysis does, is Bullshit; unless these analysts are willing to go to Russia or Donbass and put their neck under the foot.  (They aren't, curiously.)  ""Real"" analysis is not neutral, since these ""realists"" are not willing to put their asses on the line in Russia.

Edit: Finally, yes, there is a lot of real-politik in NATO/US support of Ukraine, but a great deal of this is asking the question, will Putin stop in East Ukraine/all of Ukraine; the answer is why would he stop?  Putin's great ""real"" politik mistake was the mass invasion of Ukraine, which aligned NATO together with Ukraine.  The ""real"" neutral analysis should acknowledge this and also acknowledge that the Putin paranoid in Ukraine were not stupid that in fact they correctly analyzed the ""high risk"" that Putin would do with Ukraine what he wanted to do.  So there is a huge problem in the ""real"" analysis that can't answer why ""Ukrainians would so readily abandon neutrality"".

That... seems pretty obvious here, doesn't it?

IE, Mearsheimer certainly wasn't wrong in his Ukraine predictions and you can't help but give him a certain degree of credit there.

The Russian soldiers in the video are NOT wearing the white armbands they have been wearing, which is odd.

Further, while some left leaning Reddit users have called for aggressive action, Biden has taken a very cautious approach. Not only has he not committed American forces, he has been cautious and limited in the types of weapons he has given to Ukraine and has coordinated NATO allies into falling in line on that point.

 >Since the 19th century, United States government has participated and interfered, both overtly and covertly, in the replacement of several foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for regime change mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, including the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican wars. At the onset of the 20th century, the United States shaped or installed governments in many countries around the world, including neighbors Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

I stand by my opinion that due to the consequences of doing anything that implies disagreement with state policy, the consequences to ordinary Russians are so certain and so personally catastrophic, a grass roots ""uprising"" is not likely.

 >A suitcase nuclear device (also suitcase nuke, suitcase bomb, backpack nuke, snuke, mini-nuke, and pocket nuke) is a tactical nuclear weapon that is portable enough that it could use a suitcase as its delivery method. Both the United States and the Soviet Union developed nuclear weapons small enough to be portable in specially-designed backpacks during the 1950s and 1960s. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union have ever made public the existence or development of weapons small enough to fit into a normal-sized suitcase or briefcase. The W48 however, does fit the criteria of small, easily disguised, and portable.

That was Putin's mistake that moved Ukraine decisively toward Europe and democratization and to fuck Putin. Putin's second mistake in cementing this move on the part of Ukraine was the current invasion.

Those two things happened after Euromaidan and the ousting of Yanukovych, so there was clearly already an existing drift towards the West in Ukraine, but I totally agree that Putin's annexation and funding of separatists really put it into faster gear as you could see from Poroshenko's policies. 

> So I'm sorry, this is largely just more bullshit about how Ukraine ""provoked"" Putin by refusing to stay under his/Russian yoke. And, yes, the West/US took advantage. Blaming Ukraine, as much of this ""realistic"" analysis does, is Bullshit; unless these analysts are willing to go to Russia or Donbass and put their neck under the foot. (They aren't, curiously.)

I don't fully accept this criticism, is it not clear from the piece that I believe that Ukraine's actions (generally) were totally rational and desirable? I said as much in the piece. 

I also disagree with your assessment of realist critique. Even though you and I may disagree with the rationale Mearsheimer provides, you must understand that this is not a philosophically ethical argument? Nobody in their right minds thinks what Putin is doing is ethical.

Putin's great ""real"" politik mistake was the mass invasion of Ukraine, which aligned NATO together with Ukraine. The ""real"" neutral analysis should acknowledge this and also acknowledge that the Putin paranoid in Ukraine were not stupid that in fact they correctly analyzed the ""high risk"" that Putin would do with Ukraine what he wanted to do. So there is a huge problem in the ""real"" analysis that can't answer why ""Ukrainians would so readily abandon neutrality"". In fact, the last month has answered the question; the ""real neutral"" analysis just won't accept the answer.

I don't get this critique at all? 

Again you are misunderstanding realism. I think that Putin is not as rational and I think this was a huge foreign policy blunder, but you can certainly see why Putin and the Russians would see why this is rational.

But it's also not exactly hard to see a pattern of Russian aggression (esp in 2015, after the Euromaidan and annexation of Crimea), and while you can cite realist concerns down to the very geography of the Eurasian steppe, you can also turn around and talk about Putin's individual role (which would be outside a Realist framework), which is... clearly hugely influential, itself. Maybe the more valuable analysis of the situation is not that the world is realist, but that Putin himself is a deluded ideologue who falsely considers himself a realist (which is, ironically, perhaps more of a Constructivist observation).

Some more advanced ones might do tricky stuff like copy the most-upvoted post from another related thread, piece together snippets of text from humans to quickly form a human-appearing diatribe, help an astroturfer keep track of many different copy-paste structures, or help an account farm karma so that it can have a posting history once a troll starts to use it.

But I don't think the fundamental role of spreading propaganda and posting reactionary bullshit on Reddit is something that is covered by bots. Maybe there are some people who dabble in it, maybe there are some state-level actors who have surprisingly advanced systems, but in my experience bots are not yet able to generate long passages of legible, logical, on-topic text with any kind of consistency, except by using large corpuses of human text and just rearranging it and sticking it back together.

See, the US government won't let just anyone bid on a contract.  The company has to have certifications that they have management processes in place to do things like prevent waste.  In practice this means that only extremely large companies can bid, they are then allowed to hire subcontractors who don't have those certifications to do the work, on the basis that they'll be overseeing those subcontractors, and preventing waste.

In practice this means that you have 10+ highly paid engineers and senior management in multiple hour long meetings about a single $10 USB cable.  That's not waste though, that's the process to prevent waste.

The government's solution to ""Why is this costing so much?"" is almost always more paperwork, meetings, and restricting who can supply the part even more.  So the price the government pays goes up, and the cycle repeats.

Also, the US Federal government hates hiring people as it's almost impossible to fire them.  Meanwhile, individual contractors are at will employees and can be fired at any time, and literally for no reason at all.  Also, when a company looses the contract, we then may or may not be hired by the new company.  Even if we are,, we loose all seniority, while everything changes again.  Just because company X under-bid by an impossible degree.

So, even down to the individual level, we need to be compensated for the extra risk we incur as a federal contractor.  I'm talking notices the week before Christmas that we might be unemployed at the start of the new year.  That happens far too often for comfort.  Oh, and we don't get back-pay if the government shuts down.  We just don't get paid, so that's another risk.

Oh, and don't forget the paperwork, and background screening.  A story I heard first hand is it was nearly impossible for large businesses to hire Database Administrators in Chattanooga, TN.  Why?  Because they all had drug free workplace policies and pot is huge there.

""I hope that Drone that crashed in Croatia yesterday will not cause article 5 to be declared. It crashed into nato territory technically""

or

How would Nato react if Chinese troops landed in Poland overnight to assist in Ukraine for Russia obviously

or ""Any chance the Drone crash in Croatia could trigger article 5, especially if it‚Äôs a Russian Drone?""

or

"" How would the tanks the Russians are using (t-72, t-55) fair against a M1 Abrahams or the German Leopard tank? ....Way to quick to dismiss the t-55. They‚Äôve been upgraded since then""

or

Watching the Russians get closer to Kiev city limits is like watching the Russians get to Berlin during WW2.

or

I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, there is no reason why we can‚Äôt turn car dealerships and old warehouses/factories hear into tank plants to produce the t-55 and t-72‚Äôs Ukraine needs to win this war.

We did it during WW2 we can do it today we just need the will to do it. Unfortunately Biden is to controlled by special interests like a puppet and won‚Äôt do an executive order to help the Ukrainian people.

OR 11 Days ago.....

UK military intelligence believes there were five encirclements of ukrainian forces on the 5th. This is really bad hopefully those Ukrainian army groups can do a break out or else this may be a turning point in the war.

Source this time for clarity

Or

Biden looked and sounded like a weak leader. I get that he has a stutter but my god I had to turn it off after the first few minutes. The stuttering and rambling on the major lines of delivery is like listening to chalk streak against a chalk board.

All momentum that could have been created tonight is gone now. This speech had the potential to be historic and Biden Ruins it by not being able to speak clearly and coherently

Everyone in my household aswell as my friends all agreed it was to hard to watch.

Shame because Ukraine really needs total support of the west right now..

Or the cherry on top

This entire thing is so overblown it‚Äôs laughable. There will be no invasion Russia not going to invade a us ally.

MAD works because it essentially forces nuclear powers to avoid DIRECT conflict with EACH OTHER. Sorry if you don‚Äôt fall into this camp and I come off ass an asshole but I‚Äôm really putting this out there for all to read.

This is a VERY common misconception.  MAD exists to prevent direct confrontation in each other's territories.  The sides have faced each other directly in several conflicts including recently in Syria.  An NFZ in Ukraine airspace wouldn't trigger MAD.

>So I can agree with you to a point, but you weren‚Äôt really clear in your post. Pretty much everyone I‚Äôve seen advocating for enforcing a NFZ and engaging Russia directly in Ukraine have been using your points/MAD as justification.

My point had nothing to do with an NFZ or anything else.  As long as Russia proper isn't invaded there will be little support to start a world-ending nuclear war.  Hell Putin would trade an NFZ for sanctions all day long.  The former is FAR less dangerous to his personal wealth and power in the long-term.

>And that is just ass backwards, they clearly don‚Äôt actually comprehend exactly how MAD works.

MAD has NOTHING to do with external theaters.  MAD has to do with if you attack me I destroy you and you destroy me.  If you nuke me, I nuke you, we all die.  MAD isn't about Ukraine, Syria, Bosnia, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Cuba, etc., etc., etc.  With respect I think you are the one misunderstanding exactly what MAD is and isn't and when it comes into play.  Russia has said it themselves, an existential threat to Russia.  A NFZ over Ukraine is not that.  An NFZ over Russia would be.  There is a difference that I think YOU are glossing over here.

&#x200B;

>There‚Äôs a reason we only saw proxy wars and never direct confrontation during the entirety of the Cold War.

There were direct troops on both sides of all those proxy wars.  Sometimes it was just special ops, sometimes it was more.  US had troops in Afghanistan during the Soviet days.  Soviets had troops in Vietnam as did China.  The US attempted to invade Cuba.  The proxy wars have seen a lot more direct involvement than I think you realize.  Just recently Turkey shot down a Russian fighter during the Syria shit, and US troops directly engaged Russian forces.

Well first of all, as you know given you read it - I don't subscribe to Realism as a political theory and I don't think it's useful to adhere to one school of thought in International relations. I also agree with your assessment that leaders in authoritarian states matter greatly, so I'm not sure why this blog irritates you so much given I disagree with Mearsheimer's main findings. 

I think UNDENIABLY, like literally undeniably at this stage Neorealism is the school of thought in International Relations that holds *most* true (how often do you have to see the general predictions come true to see that?)  

> The ending of the article finally comes around to the conclusion that Putin screwed Russia, which is somewhat contradictory to the earlier thrust. In this sense, if true, their own real-politik inexorable forces screwed Russia. So much for ""realism"" analysis.

Not at all, I think it's a mistake for Putin to view the world that way and I definitely think there were a myriad of alternative options he could have taken. Personally, I think from a purely cold and ""rational"" perspective he should have done this 8 years ago or really pushed for soft power post-Maidan. 

The point is you can see why Putin thinks his actions are wholly reasonable and rational, it's not a shock that when Bush talked about Georgia entering NATO he invaded Georgia and the moment Ukraine topples a pro-Russian dictator he annexes their territory and causes conflict.

I agree with that, since it would prevent Russia from bullying Ukraine and installing puppet governments. He gets it wrong when he claims that this makes the conflict the west's fault. The west did not infringe on the sovereignty of another country in this case. Russia did. Most any conflict with Russia could be ""solved"" by complete capitulation to them. That doesn't absolve Russia of it's complete and total culpability in the conflict.
> 
> 

Totally agree with a lot of this, but I think that Mearsheimer's analysis is valuable. I do think people are sort of misunderstanding it, he's not making a moral argument. He's talking about it being an entirely predictable reaction to NATO expansion. 

> Russia is an abusive partner to Ukraine. The west is an acquaintance of Ukraine's who tried to help them get out of their abusive relationship. Now Russia is beating on Ukraine and Mearsheimer is blaming Ukraine's helpful acquaintance for Russia's violence. This is not how reasonable people assign blame.

Again, I agree with this and that's why I think the Ukrainians were correct to take the path they did to try and escape but that's not his argument. His argument is that this is entirely predictable, not that it's moral. I think the problem with his analysis is that it leaves out Ukrainian rationale and incentive.

That's not what he predicted, he said they wouldn't dominate the whole of Ukraine and he was wayyy ahead of his time with regards to NATO expansion and Putin's reaction. Nobody and I mean nobody thought Russia would react the way they did except him in IR in 2014. There were many administration and ex-us admin people like Kissinger and the like who talked about it too but as far as academics, none were more accurate on this than the realists. 

I have similar quibbles about his assessment of Euromaidan, but the just ignorance of people to call him a Putinist, or ask for him to apologise shows just how weak intellectual debate is.

I mounted good criticisms of his position here: 
https://speakingintothevoid.substack.com/p/arestovychs-gamble?s=w

Mainly the lack of agency he places on the Ukrainians and the fact that I think they were totally rational, but to ignore the actual concerns with NATO is just fanciful. If you can't discuss NATO
as part of the rationale for this and don't understand why US hegemony is so important in informing these events, you aren't worth talking to.",1648344417.0,1648344121.0,t3_tp4393,t1_i29fduf,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

And whatever the West's/US's mistakes in expanding NATO after the Soviet breakup ignores the fact that the Soviet's themselves spent their economic might and world influence on their own expansion under the post-War Stalin regime (the West/US did this too, of course).

All of this ignores Ukraine's ability to determine it's own political system.  And by fragging Russia's war machine (with the help of NATO and the US), Ukraine has entered the real-politik ""realism"" calculus.  I don't think Mearsheimer really acknowledges this (or blames NATO for it); Ukraine did what it did because of their a) analysis that a Western economy and society was worth-while, b) Russia could never be trusted to give Ukraine any autonomy. They were correct, as Putin showed in 2014 and a month ago; it is not difficult at all to explain Ukraine's actions.

In so far as a prescription, it's only moral in that it could possibly inform decisions domestically that may be moral or immoral. 

It's more of an assessment of how international relations work in the geopolitical spherMearsheimer's track record is pretty good, he predicted war in the Baltics before it happened, he generally predicted this conflict and he was right about Iraq being terrible for US policy. So I don't think he's as easy to dismiss as you do. 

> And whatever the West's/US's mistakes in expanding NATO after the Soviet breakup ignores the fact that the Soviet's themselves spent their economic might and world influence on their own expansion under the post-War Stalin regime (the West/US did this too, of course).

What? Realism doesn't ignore this whatsoever? It's not like Realism is a pro-Russian ideology. 

> All of this ignores Ukraine's ability to determine it's own political system. And by fragging Russia's war machine (with the help of NATO and the US), Ukraine has entered the real-politik ""realism"" calculus. I don't think Mearsheimer really acknowledges this (or blames NATO for it); Ukraine did what it did because of their a) analysis that a Western economy and society was worth-while, b) Russia could never be trusted to give Ukraine any autonomy. They were correct, as Putin showed in 2014 and a month ago; it is not difficult at all to explain Ukraine's actions.

Not all realist analysis does this, they're not arguing from a moral perspective. He's basically saying ""Ukraine should be wiser, because although everybody can agree that the more moral argument is for it to have self-determination and the ability to be a ""westernized"" state, it's not advisable given proximity to Russia"". 

He essentially says this: 

> It‚Äôs not imperialism; this is great-power politics. When you‚Äôre a country like Ukraine and you live next door to a great power like Russia, you have to pay careful attention to what the Russians think, because if you take a stick and you poke them in the eye, they‚Äôre going to retaliate. States in the Western hemisphere understand this full well with regard to the United States.

I also agree with a lot of what your saying - which you should know given you read it, did you read the Arestovych section? 

My personal argument is that there is a very rational perspective for Russia doing this, they just underestimated the Western and Ukrainian response. Realism doesn't argue that the decisions always HAPPEN to be the best for the country, it argues that they come from a self-interested basis for survival. I don't hold to it completely, but given the lack of a supranational authority it's a compelling lens with which to view geopolitics. 

> Putin screwed Russia for at least a decade if not decades. A ""realistic"" analysis would somehow acknowledge this. And it was not inevitable; it was primarily due to Putin's mistakes of believing his own bullshit not ""realism.""

It's realist, not realistic and realists have a whole host of different opinions. Again, I agree with your arguments from a Ukrainian perspective and I think they acted rationally. But I don't think Putin is as irrational or mad as you think. 

Best example I would give is many Russian Nationalists think that he should have gone way further in 2014, and are now acting like they are vindicated.

> As somebody else suggested here, it's pre-WWI balance of power politics rewritten for the modern world. Those politics ended up failing then

They didn't fail, because that's not what realism is. It's just an explanation of how things are and basically says that countries should act in their best interests, that doesn't discount economic cooperation completely. 

> turns out that multipolarity is dangerous in state relations

Hold on, you mean like Mearsheimer and other Neorealists constantly argue? This is his perspective. Read Thomas Christensen and Jack Snyder, that does not contradict Neorealist thought at all. Obviously realists have different perspectives and some do think multipolarity brings more balance, but that's not the consensus at all and in fact most realists completely disagree with that statement because the complexity breeds more conflict.

> The EU, a body built on the grounds of economic cooperation, has done more to prevent war in Europe than any realpolitik balance of power ever did.

I agree with you that the EU is basically the strongest point against the realists but I think it's at least fair to say now that the Constructivists and Liberals are constantly less capable of predicting these events than realists are. I think the counterpoint would be (and I don't agree with this), how strong is the EU really? The United Kingdom has left, it doesn't have an army and it's not like it is an all-being supranational authority. 

I mean look at Victor Orban's response to the crisis. He's basically told the EU to go fuck themselves.",1648346029.0,1648345362.0,t3_tp4393,t1_i29h40r,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, part of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014, Russian authorities have been accused of committing war crimes, including using cluster munition and thermobaric weapons in residential areas, attacking humanitarian corridors, medical care facilities and other civilian targets, shooting at unarmed civilians and forcefully deporting them from occupied Ukrainian territory to Russia. In early March 2022, the International Criminal Court started a full investigation of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards.
 
**[Schr√∂dinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr√∂dinger's_cat)** 
 
 >In quantum mechanics, Schr√∂dinger's cat is a thought experiment that illustrates a paradox of quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger in 1935, in a discussion with Albert Einstein, to illustrate what Schr√∂dinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
