Partial excerpt:

> Our logistics are already over-extended today. We can send a much large contingent into Ukraine, and what would we get? Ukraine – a territorially enormous country, and their hate towards us is astronomical. Our roads simply cannot accommodate the resupply of such convoys, and everything will come to a halt. And we can’t pull it off from the management side because of the current chaos.
> 
> These two reasons exist concurrently, although just one of them is enough to break everything.
> 
> With regards to Russian military losses: I don’t know the reality – no one does. There was some information the first 2 days, but now no one knows what is happening in Ukraine. We’ve lost contact with major divisions (!!) They may re-establish contact, or may dissipate under an attack, and even the commanders don’t know how many are dead, injured, or captured. Total dead is definitely in the thousands, maybe 10,000, maybe 5,000, or maybe just 2,000. But even at our command no one knows. But probably closer to 10,000. And we are not counting losses at DNR & LNR.
> 
> Now even we kill Zelensky or take him prisoner, nothing will change. The level of hate toward us is similar to Chechnya. And now, even those loyal to us in Ukraine are publicly against us.
> 
> Because all of this was planned at the top (in Russia), because we were told that such a scenario will not happen except only if we were to be attacked first. Because we were told that we need to maximize our threats in order to negotiate an outcome through peace. Because we were already preparing protests against Zelensky without ever considering invading Ukraine.
> 
> Now, civilian losses in Ukraine will follow a geometric pattern progression, and resistance against us will only get stronger. Infantries already tried to enter cities – out of 20 paratrooper groups, only one had “provisional” success. Recall the invasion of Mosul – it’s a rule – happens with every country, nothing new.

I had a thought that I would like some comment on. 

I read that Russias military spending is comparable to that of the UK, being around 58 and 61 billion annually as per wikipedia. 

What Putin currently runs, is pretty much a totalitarian state. Keeping that totalitatian state intact should require quite some military power pointing inwards to keep the citizens obedient. 
At least that is what I would expect. Propaganda plays its part here as well of course. 

Now Russia is about 85 times the size of the UK, so the money flowing into the deployable part of its army would only be a fraction of that total expenditure, if the previous thought about the required inland presence of the militaty is correct. 

If any reasonable guesses can be made in regards to the money that is actually being spend on the active forces is beyond my capabilities, but it might be another factor that could contribute to the question of why Russias military is performing badly.",False,1646772243.0,t3_t9mudk,t3_t9mudk,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

One unintended effect from Russian economy cratering is that since in Russia there are many migrant workers from the 5 ex-Soviet republics in central Asia, and their remittances constitute a good percentage of their home countries' economies, now when these workers begin to lose jobs or have their pays slashed, those 5 republics would most likely also see their economies falter.

First, the ""Pwn All The Things"" (https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1501271746749468676) statement says that the craft will be ""rebranded as US aircraft"", but the statement they linked from the Polish foreign ministry doesn't say that. It just says they will ""place them at the disposal of the government of the USA.""

IF those planes are ""rebranded"" as American and then given to Ukraine, isn't this going to imply that the US is taking a direct role in the war, as opposed to just supporting Ukrainian efforts?

This seems important. NATO countries can decide to enter the conflict as individuals, rather than as NATO members, with the understanding that NATO will not defend them if they are attacked.  This might mean that the US is taking that route, to allow NATO to maintain its distance and focus on defending the rest of Europe.

In this case, Russia *still* can't strike at any of the NATO countries without bringing them all into the conflict, and how in the hell can they possibly strike at the US alone? Invade Alaska?

Would this be tantamount to a Russian/US war, and the US is effectively saying ""Nyaa, nyaa, come and get me""?

I’ve gotten some interesting answers. Thanks. I just haven’t seen much actual conversation about it besides name calling and dooming nuclear war. 

Best I can tell is there’s hope that actual war between Russia and the west is still avoidable. In which case the west is doing its best to precariously balance aid for Ukraine and sanctions with out instigating a direct conflict.

* Would there be gas and oil embargo that would have enough power to block Russian oligarchs?
* Would Nato deploy their troops?
* Would Belarus break off their engagement with Putin and block the entrance from North West?

* Will it have enough power to overtake full Ukraine?
* Are they going Syria model and burning cities to the ground/ full terrorist operation?

I kind of wonder whether Putin wanted to fully cut off from the west economically and the Ukraine war is the tool he is using.     
Before this started, during the Olympics, Xi and Putin said something along the lines of planning to reshape global power structures.     
I think China came out on top of the covid ordeal. Now with Russia cutting off resources to the world, if China decides to prop up Russia and continue to consume their resources as the already global leader in manufacturing while the west deals with a unprecedented energy and supply crisis we could see this shift in power and economic leadership happen rather quickly.        
It's pretty clear China greenlit this war and their leaders spoke extensively with Russia before the invasion. Honestly this all feels a bit more insidious as time goes on. I fear China could soon twist the dagger just by quietly creating more supply line problems or worse openly engaging in some economic attacks/warfare with the west while they are weak and economies are barely hanging on.     
After the past few years we've exhausted a lot of the economic safety nets that the feds can 'safely' implement in both the US and many other countries. It is a really bad time to fall into a great depression, I don't think we can continue print our way out of the coming one.       
I also hate to think of what moves the west might make if it begins to get desperate. Leaders on the edge of losing power if their economies collapse can do stupid things that could escalate the situation even more.

Taken from that perspective I think a few things can be inferred…

1.	From the perspective of the needs of protecting Russia’s long term future, what Putin is doing actually makes sense, at least to him. 
2.	If Putin is thinking toward the future he likely doesn’t want to die himself, or have his country destroyed. He likely doesn’t want to have a nuclear war and destroy everything. 
3.	He is probably weighing the harm being caused to their economy which he may be assuming can fixed in a relatively short time once this is resolved (a few years) vs the potential of what the Russian future may look like long term if they don’t succeed. It’s obvious which he is leaning towards now, but maybe the reality of the calculation changing may eventually cause a backtrack. 

Part of this is assuming Putin just can’t grasp better ways of improving his country by being more ingrained with the international economy as a whole, and just sees direct power and money as a solution. Whereas if he wasn’t such a strongman, he might see a future with Russia coexisting in a better worldwide economy that isn’t such a zero sum game. 

All that said, maybe I’m just the crazy one and he is a madman. Also, all that said, it’s not worth the risk of other countries getting directly involved in case he is willing to deploy their nuclear arsenal.

The Russian puppet was ousted from Ukraine in 2014. In an honestly very impressive panic move, Russia annexed Crimea and set up two fake republics in exactly one week (obviously there was contingency planning before that which enabled this). They fucked up though, and didn't actually get a route connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland.

Crimea is important for all sorts of reasons, but a big one is that it has lots of gas. The Russian Federation is a kleptocracy that has about 30 years to steal as much money as they can from Russia's natural resources before either the world goes carbon neutral or there is an irreversible climate catastrophe. An independent Ukraine, with Crimea, able to export natural gas to Europe while saying, ""Look at me! I'm a democracy!"" would seriously cut into those 30 years of profits.

Accurately lining up a shot, over a similar distance to the targeting range of a Javelin, with a high-calibre rifle, allowing for drop, windage, deflection upon impact and a multitude of other factors, is not something the average volunteer fighter can do. Only a very small number of your soldiers, taken from elite units, will likely have the ability and training to use an anti-materiel rifle effectively.

An Anti-Material rifle is a high-power, high-caliber, personally used rifle designed for use against vehicles (hence anti-material).  The one most commonly thought of would be the Barrett .50 Caliber Bolt Action rifle, which chambers and fires a .50 Browning Machine Gun cartridge. The effective range for this variety of rifle is around one mile.

These guns are large, loud, expensive, and heavy, but are pretty useless against tanks.  That being said, they are less expensive than armored vehicles and a lot less expensive than Javelin missiles. However, to use one means the shooter would also be exposed to counter-fire.

The other thing is impact and effects... an anti-material rifle *could* incapacitate a truck, but the items said truck was carrying would likely be just fine.  An anti-tank rocket or Javelin Missile would *destroy* the vehicle and its contents.",False,1646767463.0,t3_t9mudk,t1_hzvi91j,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Sign up for the Russia-Ukraine War Briefing.  Every evening, we'll send you a summary of the day's biggest news. Get it sent to your inbox.
On a snowy tarmac at Amari Air Base in northern Estonia on Sunday morning, pallets of rifles, ammunition and other weapons were being loaded onto one of the largest cargo planes in the world, an Antonov AN-124, belonging to the Ukrainian air force. It is an artifact of the Cold War, built and purchased when Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union.

Now it is being turned back against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, part of a vast airlift that American and European officials describe as a desperate race against time, to get tons of arms into the hands of Ukrainian forces while their supply routes are still open. Scenes like this, reminiscent of the Berlin airlift — the famed race by the Western allies to keep West Berlin supplied with essentials in 1948 and 1949 as the Soviet Union sought to choke it off — are playing out across Europe.

In less than a week, the United States and NATO have pushed more than 17,000 antitank weapons, including Javelin missiles, over the borders of Poland and Romania, unloading them from giant military cargo planes so they can make the trip by land to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and other major cities. So far, Russian forces have been so preoccupied in other parts of the country that they have not targeted the arms supply lines, but few think that can last.

But those are only the most visible contributions. Hidden away on bases around Eastern Europe, forces from United States Cyber Command known as “cybermission teams” are in place to interfere with Russia’s digital attacks and communications — but measuring their success rate is difficult, officials say.
In Washington and Germany, intelligence officials race to merge satellite photographs with electronic intercepts of Russian military units, strip them of hints of how they were gathered, and beam them to Ukrainian military units within an hour or two. As he tries to stay out of the hands of Russian forces in Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine travels with encrypted communications equipment, provided by the Americans, that can put him into a secure call with President Biden. Mr. Zelensky used it Saturday night for a 35-minute call with his American counterpart on what more the U.S. can do in its effort to keep Ukraine alive without entering into direct combat on the ground, in the air or in cyberspace with Russian forces.

Mr. Zelensky welcomed the help so far, but repeated the criticism that he has made in public — that the aid was wildly insufficient to the task ahead. He asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a shutdown of all Russian energy exports and a fresh supply of fighter jets.

It is a delicate balance. On Saturday, while Mr. Biden was in Wilmington, Del., his National Security Council staff spent much of the day trying to find a way for Poland to transfer to Ukraine a fleet of well-used, Soviet-made MIG-29 fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots know how to fly. But the deal is contingent on giving Poland, in return, far more capable, American-made F-16s, an operation made more complicated by the fact that many of those fighters are promised to Taiwan — where the United States has greater strategic interests.

Polish leaders have said there is no deal, and are clearly concerned about how they would provide the fighters to Ukraine and whether doing so would make them a new target of the Russians. The United States says it is open to the idea of the plane swap.

“I can’t speak to a timeline, but I can just tell you that we’re looking at it very, very actively,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Sunday, during a trip that has taken him to Moldova, another non-NATO country that American officials fear may be next on Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s hit list of nations to bring back into Moscow’s sphere of influence.
And in downtown Washington, lobbying groups and law firms that once charged the Ukrainian government handsomely for their services are now working for free, helping Mr. Zelensky’s embattled government plead for more sanctions on Russia.

The Ukrainians are also asking for more money for weapons, though they reject the idea that Washington is manipulating Mr. Zelensky’s image to present him as Churchill in a T-shirt, rallying his country to war. Covington & Burling, a major law firm, filed a motion pro bono on behalf of Ukraine in the International Court of Justice.

It is, in many ways, a more complex effort than the Berlin airlift three-quarters of a century ago. West Berlin was a small territory with direct air access. Ukraine is a sprawling country of 44 million from which Mr. Biden has pulled all American forces in an effort to avoid becoming a “co-combatant” in the war, a legal term that governs how far the United States can go in helping Ukraine without being considered in direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.

But as the weapons flow in and if efforts to interfere in Russian communications and computer networks escalate, some U.S. national security officials say they have a foreboding that such conflict is increasingly likely. The American legal definitions of what constitutes entering the war are not Mr. Putin’s definitions, one senior American national security official warned over the weekend, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the American overt and covert efforts to aid Ukraine.

Mr. Putin warned on Saturday that any nation that attempted to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be “participating in the armed conflict.” On Sunday the Russian ministry of defense issued a statement warning NATO countries like Romania against allowing their bases to be used as a safe haven for the remaining planes in the Ukrainian air force. If they do so, it said, any “subsequent use against the Russian armed forces can be regarded as the involvement of these states in an armed conflict.”

Two decades ago this month, as American forces began to flow into Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus famously asked, “Tell me how this ends.” In the case of Ukraine, a senior American official said, the question resonating around the White House is more like: “Tell me how we don’t get sucked in to a superpower conflict.”",False,1646769105.0,t3_t9mudk,t1_hzvnivz,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

As to why the Russians would consider planes an offensive action and not the shit ton of guns and munitions countries are sending to Ukraine, it's because the those planes would not only severely contest Russia already weak control of Ukraine's airspace, it would also potentially give the Ukrainians the ability to strike into Russia.

Of course whether the Russians would actually pull Poland into the war over this is an 'up in the air' question, most of Russia's effective combat units are bogged down in Ukraine, Poland has a massive military build up on the border with Belarus.

The cloud, be it Azure, AWS, Salesforce, or whomever is a perfectly legitimate military target. Because essentially all it is is a bunch of data centers scattered strategically in different regions around the world, and companies of various sizes(including enterprises) are increasingly migrating their entire software suites into the cloud where ever possible to cut costs on rolling their infrastructure.

If I was in charge of a state-run cyber ware division I would target systems that walled gardens i.e. EPIC, Salesforce, AWS, etc. because you can destroy their infrastructure you can put many companies out of business. Since you cannot quickly or easily migrate away from them. As opposed to trying to find zero days for commonly used dependencies, frameworks, libraries, etc. so you can go spearfishing.

Russia's insistence that the US (or any NATO country) isn't allowed to do so is a bluff. Because enforcing that self-declared ban means taking on the USAF and NATO forces head to head and significantly expanding a war that already isn't going well by attacking very, very strong forces.

Russia will bitch and moan and stomp their feet and wail. They might even ramp up some asymmetric counters like cyber or information operations which can be difficult to attribute to one country...

It is easy to say 20 years later Iraq was wrong. ( even this is debatable because we have no idea what would happen if we did not invaded Iraq) 

It is very hard to decide, right now, what is the best line of actions that will lead to minimal negative consequences. 

When Germans decided shut down nuclear power plants, they thought this was a good idea. Today they probably regret it. They may decide to invest billions into nuclear power plants only to learn few decades later that there was cheaper or safer alternatives.

Boost: The missile’s most vulnerable few minutes, from ignition through launch to engine shutoff at the edge of the atmosphere.


Midcourse: The missile is now on its course, with the midpoint its apogee in space, and the latter half a descent arcing to its target with greater speed (as long as 20 minutes for ICBMs);


Terminal: The final minute or so, when the warhead or warheads re-enter the atmosphere.


The U.S. military has four systems to shoot down ballistic missiles, most focusing on the second and third phases. It’s an expensive approach, to be sure; and in 17 years of tests, the four systems have hit their targets about four out of of every five tries. But military planners know that when the missiles actually fly, a single missed intercept could have unspeakably catastrophic consequences.

Basically, make it so expensive to forcibly annex neighbors that everyone opts not to. While it'd certainly be advantageous to instill a friendly regime in the world's most resource rich country, I don't think anyone's seriously aiming for that right now. There hasn't been any talk to that effect in the West before this war, anyway.

Interestingly, it seems like there's a pretty substantial fear among Russian academics of exactly this. Not now though, but some ten years down the line when Russia's military would have further lapsed. The move into Ukraine is viewed by many Russian professors as preemptive of Russia eventually becoming a theatre like the middle east.

I don’t find this rationale compelling here, though. There is no rational basis to assume that Ukraine - nor any other western power - would ever directly threaten Russia’s borders or sovereignty. Stability is good for markets and trade, and Europe desires Russia’s natural resources. See: Nord Stream 2. This was clearly an offensive war, and not a “preemptive defensive” one. 

As for Donbas, I could *maybe* see a rationale for an invasion and police action there on behalf of ethnic Russians, but nearly every basis of that invasion was false. Yes, children have died in the fighting on Donbas, but no one is being prevented from speaking Russian and there is no ethnic cleansing.

It might be hard for Russian anti-aircraft units if there are a bunch of Migs flying around.

 >The First American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Republic of China Air Force, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was formed to help oppose the Japanese invasion of China. Operating in 1941–1942, it was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC), Navy (USN), and Marine Corps (USMC), and was commanded by Claire Lee Chennault. Their Curtis P-40B Warhawk aircraft, marked with Chinese colors, flew under American control. Recruited under President Franklin Roosevelt's authority before Pearl Harbor, their mission was to bomb Japan and defend the Republic of China, but many delays meant the AVG first flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

 >The Soviet Union covertly operated the world's largest, longest, and most sophisticated biological weapons program, thereby violating its obligations as a party to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. The program began in the 1920s and lasted until at least September 1992 but has possibly been continued by Russia after that. During World War II, Joseph Stalin was forced to move his biological warfare (BW) operations out of the way of advancing German forces and may have used tularemia against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad. By 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union.

I can certainly see where that's coming from, especially when we think of (1) foreign direct investment, (2) hardships caused by issues relating to payment processing, unfavourable exchange rates etc. that make it a nightmare to pay salaries or satisfy other operating costs.

But even with all these being taken into account and leaving aside businesses which cannot legally pursue their operations due to sanctions on Russian entities, there's still a lot of money to be made in Russia (as per my example: McD's revenue in Russia was 9% of the global total - even with a whole new array of challenges, they'd still probably make some decent money there).

I know that you can play it for free, now (just google it) and that it's compatible on windows 10. The controls are about as clunky as ever (probably feels even moreso if you're used to more modern RTS like Starcraft II and Warcraft  III... err, feels wierd to call Warcraft III 'modern' - given I forced myself to stop playing the game about 15  years ago lmao). 

I think the last I heard, a Red Alert remaster may be in the works, but I don't know if it's finished already (or if not, then when it's coming out). 

Quick google search re: The Remaster (I'm just sharing the URL, I haven't actually read what's on the website beyond opening it in a new tab). I'm just on reddit obsessively and shouldn't be spending too much time looking into that stuff.

**EDIT**: OMG. I just realized, what I played last year *was* the remaster. I completely forgot! That's why I bought it on... steam? I think? Yeah, I bought it on Steam. 

It was a lot of fun. The nostalgia is amazing. The music, especially, is one of the best parts of the experience! The guy who composed the soundtrack (Frank Klepecki, sp?) apparently did it when he was really young. He returned to remaster the tracks and their fucking amazing.

 >Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture, is a process in which law enforcement officers take assets from people who are suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime.

Then, there is the assumption that the submarine remains undetected in a small-ish body of water in close proximity to a lot of angry warships, including some other submarines. It would almost certainly be detected, even if positive ID wasn't possible.

As compared to the MiGs it would be very obvious that it was very directly a US weapon fired from a US platform. The MiGs, as far as public info is concerned, still use Russian weapons and Russian RADAR. Russia will probably never be able prove that a given kill came from a plane that had seen US hands as opposed to one that had always been Ukrainian; they won't even be able to definitively prove it wasn't friendly fire from themselves.",False,1646774185.0,t3_t9mudk,t1_hzvy156,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Agreed. 

I hope we all realize that the public face being put on this does not reflect the reality behind the scenes. However, there is the rest of the world to consider, and how they will feel about NATO and the US afterwards.

As I understand it, any NATO nation can enter a conflict *independently*, without involving NATO. They simply lose the right to be *defended* by NATO.

The US can step outside of NATO and take action on their own, and that still leaves Putin on the spot about attacking any of the other NATO countries. That would put him in the position of being engaged in conflict with a country *that he cannot reach* without using nukes.

As far as I can tell, the only threat Putin can make to the US is nukes. If we have excellent reasons for believing that he can't or won't use his nukes, I'd think he has a problem.

Like I said the skies are way too contested for this idea to even be entertained. It's a nice fantasy I don't disagree there but there's absolutely no way to ensure a safe channel for aircraft to those cities.

Its not so black and white and there's not a single alternative of ""then don't try"". There's so many other options. There's no guarantee it would be a success, that the supplies would even get to Ukranians (assuming you are against resupplying Russian soldiers all over the country), or that it would have lasting impact on besieged cities. You're just asking for pilots and aircraft to get shot in addition to Ukranian loss of life. The risk is insanely high. It could even escalate the conflict and ramp up Russian aggression on the ground and be perceived as an act of war. There's way too many variables and uncertainties to do something like this.

(1) His claim that Ukraine is a “fiction.” This was held by some Soviet-era leaders but not all of them. Khrushchev’s transfer of Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 demonstrated a territorial acknowledgement and respect for Ukraine. Hell, western Russia was governed from Kyiv between 822 and 1240 during the “Kievan Rus” era.

(2) Putin intends to remove the government of Ukraine. If Russia installed a Russian-sympathetic government (either by force or through rigged elections), it would create another “buffer” state between the Russian home front and NATO. This was the key element of the Warsaw Pact, and made sense given Napoleon’s and Hitler’s invasions of Russia from the West. But no nation had any interest in invading Russia, through Ukraine or otherwise. So there is no need for a “buffer state.”

Otherwise….it’s hard to find a justification that isn’t ports and hydrocarbons. Russia’s invasion or Crimea more than doubled their claimed territorial sea area along the Black Sea. Russia’s notable exports are mineral fuels, precious metals, iron, steel and wheat. Whatever they could do to remain a petrolstate or hydrocarbonstate is what will keep their economy strong.

f320a6c58c3f6e7a71891d506751d450,t9mudk,hzvix3s,"Okay, I'll elaborate.

* Russia is a society where Putin has spent 20 years portraying ""The West"" as the enemy
* and a number of years cleaning out everyone he doesn't trust
* Russians have an age-old tradition for ""obeying one strong leader no matter what""
* And a ditto tradition for enduring all kinds of hardships

For anyone following state media, Putin portrays this as self defence. And when it comes to defending Mother Russia, the common Russian obeys, starves and dies if needed.

Moreover; the Russian masses don't get any reports of failure, ""things go as planned"", and they aren't actually beaten.

Moreover; Russians have no tradition for expecting leaders to tell the actual truth anyway.  


A military coup would need one strong general (or something) that has the support of the armed forces. It is my strong belief that such a person does not exist.

But the gist - Russian population is dwindling, low birth rate, so military age men population is going down.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

- This is politics now and I'm probably wrong but we'll see in a coming days. I'm talking about sanctions from my experience, we had them for some 8-9 years (not this harsh but close) and we (by we I mean Yugoslavia) didn't have much problems with food, jobs... and regular stuff like that. We only had poor neighboring countries that we could ""workaround"" sanctions and that worked. Contrary to popular belief sanctions group us together and to government (that government was shit but we had common enemy... ) 

Thing with sanctions is that they work if country have to import essential stuff, they surely have planned this kind of world response (this will put a strong pressure on government surly), it's really difficult to sanction countrie like Russia (that produce almost everything for them self) nowdays when they have China/India... to trade with.
