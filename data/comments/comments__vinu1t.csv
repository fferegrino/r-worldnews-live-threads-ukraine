Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 23 June 2022
 

- Since 19 June, Russian forces have highly likely advanced over 5km towards the southern approaches of the Donbas city of Lysychansk. Some Ukrainian units have withdrawn, probably to avoid being encircled. Russia's improved performance in this sector is likely a result of recent unit reinforcement and heavy concentration of fire.

- Russian forces are putting the Lysychansk-Sieverodonetsk pocket under increasing pressure with this creeping advance around the fringes of the built-up area. However, its efforts to achieve a deeper encirclement to take western Donetsk Oblast remain stalled.

From CNN’s Arnaud Siad in London

The European Union and Norway agreed on Thursday to further strengthen their cooperation in the energy field, providing the EU with additional gas supplies, Norway's oil and energy ministry said.

“We had a good and constructive meeting, where we agreed to cooperate even closer on energy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made closer cooperation necessary,” said Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje Aasland.

Some background: Europe's energy crisis escalated this month as Russia further reduced supplies to Germany, Italy and other members of the European Union. Twelve EU countries have so far been affected by Russian gas supply cuts, the bloc's climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said on Thursday.

Russia's state gas company Gazprom slashed flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany by 60% last week, blaming the move on the West's decision to withhold vital turbines because of sanctions. Italian energy giant ENI said Gazprom was cutting its supplies by 15%.

A joint statement from the EU and Norway noted that “Norway’s oil and gas production for European energy security has increased further after Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.”

According to the statement, Norway currently delivers approximately one-fourth of EU countries’ gas consumption and is producing gas “at very high capacity.”",False,1656000060.0,t3_vinu1t,t3_vinu1t,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Day 120 of my updates from Kharkiv.

There were a lot of missile strikes today. We counted at least 7 explosions starting from 9:30pm, 3 of them were somewhere very close to us, as they were extremely loud. Actually they started their shelling just 10 minutes after the news about Ukraine getting the EU candidate status was posted, looks like they really didn’t like that.

The explosions at 9:30pm might have been regular shelling, although I’m not so sure about it. The ones starting at 11pm were missiles, they fired 3 of them and those were the ones that landed nearby, not sure where, but we have some places in mind. Even though this war is already 4 months old, we still can never get used to those missile strikes, they are scary every single time. 

We even know the exact time they happen, and yet they feel horrible every single time. The Iskanders they launch every day, with their 500kg warhead, will almost certainly level any apartment building, and you never know where the next one will land. When they land close to you, the vibrations that go through your body are extremely unpleasant, not even talking about the insanely loud sound of the explosion itself, saying that it makes you jump would be an understatement.  

Today the Russian MOD is yet again posting their bullshit, and they were talking about Kharkiv this time. They said that “Nazis are holding sick children and personnel hostages in a children’s clinic” they also said that those “Nazis” are planning to blow it up to blame Russians for it. What the fuck is wrong with them, what is this insanity? Conveniently the “Nazis” are planning to blow it up right when the Russia is shelling our “military objects (meaning schools, universities, malls).” 

They even said the address for that clinic, and it’s only a couple of kilometers away from me. What we fear is that those 3 explosions at 11pm that sounded very close to us might have just been coming from that direction. Those fuckheads also said that “Nazis” are making firing position in the apartment buildings while threatening to kill the people living in those apartments. What the fuck are they even talking about?

Details: Zelenskyy noted that many Ukrainians have already learned how to repulse an aggressor. In the future, Ukraine will work to widen the participation of Ukrainian citizens in the country’s defence.

Quote from Zelenskyy: ""This concerns not only the security of our borders, but also internal security. With neighbours like ours, we can expect bombardments, cruise missiles and who knows what else at any moment. So the air defence system of our country has to be improved.

We will build a European country, which will be a member of the European Union. But with a defence system as powerful as that of Israel.""

Turkey supports the UN-proposed plan to export grain from Ukraine, which foresees the creation of a safety zone directly near Ukraine's territorial waters where the vessels going to the Ukrainian ports will undergo checks in order to prevent weapons transportation.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said this at a news conference with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in Ankara on Thursday, Ukrinform reports.

""There is a UN plan to export grain from Ukraine. We continue our efforts together with the UN. We are in contact with both Ukraine and Russia. We see this UN plan as realistic, so we strongly support it. We also consider this process important from the point of view of legitimacy,"" Cavusoglu said.

According to him, the plan foresees the creation of a safety zone for the movement and inspection of ships.

""A safety zone will be set up near the Ukrainian territorial waters, where ships bound for Ukrainian ports will also be inspected to make sure that weapons or something similar is not being transported,"" Cavusoglu said.

The minister said that a meeting on technical issues would be held in Istanbul, but its date was not yet known.

""We are very clear that this grain crisis is urgent, that it needs to be solved within the next month. […] The United Kingdom is offering our expertise on all of those fronts to make sure that we have measures in place so that grain can safely leave, but it is going to require an international effort,"" Truss said.

Cavusoglu also said that Turkey would not allow grain stolen from Ukraine to enter his country.

""We are against the illegal sale of Ukrainian grain to international markets by Russia or another country,"" he said.

From CNN’s Chris Liakos

The EU says it will “swiftly” work on increasing military support to Ukraine and will work on further financial assistance.

In a news release following the first day of the two-day EU Summit, the European Council said, “The European Union remains strongly committed to providing further military support to help Ukraine exercise its inherent right of self-defence against the Russian aggression and defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty. To this end, the European Council calls on the Council to swiftly work on a further increase of military support.”

The European Council also urged Russia to “immediately stop targeting agricultural facilities and removing cereals, and to unblock the Black Sea, in particular the port of Odesa, so as to allow the export of grain and commercial shipping operations,” blaming Russia for the global food security crisis.

“Russia, by weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, is solely responsible for the global food security crisis it has provoked,” it said.

The European Council also condemned “Russia’s indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure,” adding that “international humanitarian law, including on the treatment of prisoners of war, must be respected.”

From CNN’s Arnaud Siad in London

Various European leaders immediately reacted to the European Council’s decision to grant Ukraine and Moldova candidate status. 

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter: “Very pleased with the Leaders’ endorsement of our Opinions. [Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia] all have work to do before moving to the next stage of the process. I know that they will move swiftly. They know how crucial this is for their democracies, their economies and their citizens.”

“This decision strengthens us all. It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats,” she added.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said, “On the right side of history. Congratulations to the people of Ukraine and Moldova. Today we gave hope. For freedom, for democracy, for our future.”

“This is #Europe's moment,” she added.

EU Foreign Affairs Chief Josep Borrell said the decision “marked the beginning of a long journey that we will walk together,” and said “Ukraine will prevail. Europe will prevail.”

“The Ukrainian people belong to the European family. Ukraine’s future is with the EU,” he added.

Meanwhile, Latvia's Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš said, “Today [the European Commission] took a historic decision to grant the #EU candidate state status to Ukraine and Moldova. It is the next step in their European dream. We will be side by side with you in the further European integration process - supporting and sharing our experience.”

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda called it a “big victory for Ukraine and for the European Union!” and a “very important and timely decision.”

And Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called it “a historic achievement” and a decision that “brings hope and trust in the EU future for the people of these countries and great responsibility for their leaders",False,1656018121.0,t3_vinu1t,t3_vinu1t,,0,14,0,14,1,0,

Russia ""miscalculated"" in Ukraine on several counts, the UK's ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has said.

In a statement, Neil Bush said Russian forces had ""underestimated"" the Ukrainian people and the result of their aggression had been to ""unite the free world in support of Ukraine"".

He said: ""The Russian government has miscalculated in Ukraine on several counts. Firstly, they have underestimated the resolve and heroism of the Ukrainian people, who successfully defended their capital and forced Russian invaders into retreat. 

""Secondly, they have underestimated the resolve of the international community; the result of this aggression has been to unite the free world in support of Ukraine, bolstering international cooperation and isolating Russia politically and economically. 

""And finally, they have underestimated the strength of the principle of sovereignty in the 21st century; President Putin's actions have only brought into sharper focus the right of all countries to determine their own foreign, defence and security policy.""

* In the Kherson area to the south there is a media blackout on movements as Ukraine attempts to position itself to retake Kherson.  Before the blackout Ukraine was making slow, steady advances that put pressure on russia's supply lines.

Ukraine's former deputy defence minister, Alina Frolova, has been speaking to Sky's Kay Burley this morning as Russian forces continue with their offensive in the country's eastern region.

She said while the situation was ""brutal"" and ""tough"" and the country was ""losing people every day"", morale was still ""quite high"".

Ms Frolova said: ""There is a strong will to win this war and there is no doubt in Ukraine about who will be the winner.""

She went on to say that the country's EU membership application was ""about the political declaration that Ukraine is acknowledged as a European nation"".

""We understand this is not a membership and that we have a long period in front of us to implement the requirements but for us it's important from the moral point of view,"" she added.

Asked about the possibility of NATO membership, Ms Frolova said it was a ""difficult story"" as the country was presently at war.

However, after the war the country would be able to ""bring a lot to the security of Europe"", with huge battlefield and combat experience, she continued.

She added: ""I would say our army would be one of the best after this war.""

So since Russia is paid euros and dollars for its oil and gas, what happens is that the companies have to sell these euros and dollars to Russian banks / stock exchange and get the roubles in return, which they use to pay all their internal expenses (salaries, taxes, expenses, etc). Before the war, the government (which also owns the majority of these oil and gas companies) keeps the rouble's value at a desirable rate, so that when they sell these euros and dollars to the banks and exchange, they get more roubles for it. 

So the war breaks out and the rouble's value immediately tanks (at one point reaching over 100 roubles to the US dollar). The companies then naturally want to hold on to dollars and euros, at which point the government forced them to sell. 

Moving forward, the price of oil skyrockets, and customers are still buying all of this oil and gas in euros and dollars, and all this has to be immediately sold into roubles. Since Russia is suddenly getting massive amounts of foreign currency, the demand for the rouble (internally) now skyrockets and naturally increases in value, while the banks and exchange in Russia are being flooded with dollars and euros. This is also why they were desperate to bully Europe into buying with roubles. Not just for the sake of bullying - but because they actually desperately need roubles.

Normally, without sanctions, this would be offset by Russian companies buying those euros and dollars to import foreign goods, but of course due to sanctions, there are basically no imports. So Russia, in a bizarre twist, has more dollars and euros than they know what to do with. This explains why currency exchanges in Russia are actually selling euros and dollars now to regular people, at pretty good rates (rates havent been this good since after the Crimean annexation settled down around 2015). 

What does this mean going forward? Russian central bank wants and needs to devalue the rouble so they can get more bang for their buck, but there are no real easy options to do so. I'm not an expert on economics so I don't really know whether making money printer go brrr would help their case here, but given the serious inflation we're already seeing in Russia, I guess they want to avoid turning that 20-30% inflation into 50+%. Also as I understand printing roubles doesn't really fix the problem.

The bang from an Iskander may be more disturbing.  10 shells at 51 kilos each is much more dangerous than 1 big one at 510 kilo.  It will be harder for Russia to sustain fire with iskanders than it would be using 152 mm D20s.  

Feeling a stronger shock wave likely means that they are closer to you.  Blast goes by cube of distance so 10x mass should be the same boom at 2.1x the distance.  It is also possible that they used thermobaric weapons or bunker penetrating rounds.  Bunker busters would shake the ground much more than a normal airburst shell.  A thermobaric (fuel air explosive) would feel and sound different.  Last speculation, the artillery shells may have dumped more energy into the buildings they hit.  A larger bomb could send more energy into the atmosphere making it audible further away.

But Venezuelas troubles go way back to when we decided that we were tired of having so much acid-rain and put measures in place to curb sulfur-dioxide emissions. Venezuela’s oil is famously high-sulfur, and with the stroke of a pen their oil suddenly became way less economically competitive. They had gotten used to a particular revenue-stream, and they cut back on maintenance expenditures instead of sacrificing ‘profit’. Their ‘kicking out the evil foreigners’ was more of a ‘we don’t want to spend money on what those foreigners are doing for us any more’, re-branded.


But yeah, Russia is fucked. Venezuela is actually potentially redeemable, their oil is very close to the surface and on a large shallow sea-shelf, ideal for low production-costs.

I posit that Russian leadership is absolutely fine with losing these people given their record of disdain for human life. Strategically they capture SVD (and probably try for Donetsk Oblast), hold the line for however long it takes, Ukraine/West eventually wears itself out due to food/resource scarcity / inflation, and call it a victory. People at home are happy / anti-war protests have been suppressed. Sanctions... both sides are equally hurt.

Russia may not have achieved their moonshot objective, but they haven't lost either.

Did they throw away most of their modern materiel and exhaust their supply? Yes... but who's actually going to take advantage of that? NATO's not going to invade Russia. Neither is China. Neither is Japan - US will keep them in line. Syria might be more unstable due to a weaker Russia but it's ISIS they don't give a crap about that... Turkey is nibbling at the heels of the kurds, so the Kurds won't do anything in Syria either. 

---

The key to avoiding this outcome will be in Kherson - Ukr failure in Kherson (""HuR DuR WesTeRn wEApOns"") will set the pattern for the rest of the war. Ukr success in Kherson is certain victory.

This is why Ukr fought tooth and nail for Mariupol, and why they're fighting tooth and nail for SVD. It has to maintain it's defenders advantage as long as possible. They cannot let Russia settle into a position where they can sit back and chuck shells and rockets for months on end, and spread their forces across the line defensively.

If Russia's forces were still on or near their full strength and it would take them just a few weeks to prepare for another invasion against a much stronger enemy (the whole NATO). Maybe then we had to worry about the threats against the Baltic nations.

&#x200B;

But the reality is much different. Russia is still struggling to make any significant gains in eastern Ukraine. From all we now, the Russian army took heavy losses, especially their most elite units, and has today only a fraction of the strength it had when the invasion of Ukraine began. Even in the best case scenario for Russia (spontaneous collapse of Ukrainian resistance and the West dropping its sanctions immediately) it would take years for the Russian army to get back to a level where they could even dream to take on the entire NATO.

The only thing Russia can do right now is making empty threats and bragging about their nuclear weapons. But even a smooth brain like Putin (\*) knows that the moment Russia uses a nuclear weapon against a NATO country, Russia itself is doomed. No one wins a nuclear war.

Optimistically, Ukraine shoves Russia all the way out of it's pre feb 2014 borders hoping that Russia runs out of resources/troops before Ukraine does.

And on the Ukraine side, i expect either outcome, Ukraine is not going to accept any agreement that does not permit it to join the EU or NATO after what Russia's pulled.

If you count the civilians that Russia is mercilessly murdering, sure Ukraine has had larger losses, but talking only military assets, multiple intel sources are confirming that Russia and their assets are dying faster than the Ukranians. And their morale is much worse while their at it.

If Russia wanted to negotiate a white peace with everything returning to how it was before this round of fighting and basically nothing be accomplished but the death, I'd support it just to stop the fighting (as long as they promised to return everyone they kidnapped away to Russia.)

If Russia does have the will to keep fighting, then I say the West needs to support it all the way to end. Even to the point of joining the war directly if it does appear Ukraine can't win. To everyone worried about nuclear war, I say that staying out would only delay it. If Russia does get away with stealing more territory, they're just going to keep up their wars of conquest until the West does finally decide to stand up and make them pay for it.

Early on Russian comms were talking about 200-300 man units being totally devastated in a day or two, when the unit destruction counts were only a few hundred people a day; Ukraine wouldn't confirm any of such casualty counts, as they had no hard evidence, but, those units would *act* as though they were decimated, failing to attack or withdrawing haphazardly and abandoning equipment en masse.

I looked into how Ukraine reports Russian losses and their way of reporting is pretty stringent; basically, their estimates are things like ""if we blew up a truck, did we *see* the people inside?  How many did we *actually count?*"", etc.  I have a hunch those estimates could be augmented slightly with the internal ""official"" numbers the Russian field commanders are giving, which would be, given Russia's propensities, underestimations.

Ultimately after this blows over, I have a *very very strong hunch* that Russian casualty figures will be higher than expected.  The DPR has admitted openly to a **55%** casualty rate with about 4:1 wounded to dead, which is just absolutely mindblowing.  I have no idea how they're going on at all, much less going against Ukraine and not Russia.

ba7b8f4a4c2772daf3f797f765d15247,vinu1t,idg29qc,"IDK why you are downvoted. This is a big issue. 

The biggest need that Ukraine has for those planes is SEAD operations. And that is not a simple thing that can be taught quickly. Additionally, all of the flight systems are different, the doctrine is different, and weapon systems are different. Sure, you can do a crash course, but it's still going to take a long time to fully utilize the planes. Oh and many of the SEAD operating planes will be shot down because Russia has basically blanketed the area with huge numbers of sophisticated SAMS. 

Additionally, training these pilots on an abbreviated schedule also means that they'll be flying NATO planes, which means NATO pilots will lose out on training hours. Currently, NATO planes have a very busy maintenance and flying schedule. There are only a certain number of hours each plane can fly per year, and that means NATO pilots will be pushed out. Is it a big deal? IDK, but it is an impact that will affect the quality of NATO pilots. 

Also, a lot of people don't realize that the huge advantages that the US air power has is based not just on the planes, but on the entire combined arms operations (CAS, radio comms training, close coordination with ground troops, forward air controllers). Ukraine doesn't have combined arms operations, so the impact of these planes will be much smaller than US air power. 

Finally, air superiority will probably still be contested even a year from now. Without hundreds of Ukraine/NATO sorties per day (probably 20-50 SEAD operations minimum per day), Russia will still have A LOT of anti-air capability that will continue to contest the air. To knock that out, NATO basically need to give Ukraine a couple thousand jets along with all of the support staff (probably 100k people). And nobody is going to do that. So the air will remain contested for a long time. 

Basically, a few F15/16 just aren't going to be that impactful on the battlefield soon. They are not a silver bullet. 

Given all of the above, I honestly think 50 predator/TB2s drones would have probably 10x the impact of 50 F15/F16s. Because predators/TB2s can do SEAD operations at a much lower cost and without risking valuable pilots.",False,1656000672.0,t3_vinu1t,t1_ideypm4,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

The Kremlin recently replaced the commander of the Russian Airborne forces and could be in the process of a major shakeup of their current command structure in Ukraine, according to a new report from the Institute for the Study of War. 

The analysis found that many top officials could be blamed for the failure to fully capture Ukraine, prompting the Kremlin to replace those officers with new faces. 

Current Chief of Staff of the Central Military District, Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, will replace the current Commander of the Russian Airborne Forces, Colonel-General Andrey Serdyukov, according to the report.

Ukrainian sources reported that Serdyukov was previously fired from his post by the Kremlin for ""poor performance"" and ""high casualties,"" according to ISW's report. 

""Such drastic rotations within the Russian military, if true, are not actions taken by a force on the verge of a major success and indicate ongoing dysfunction in the Kremlin's conduct of the war,"" the report states.

The ISW also listed other rumors of high-level Russian military leaders being purged from the ranks, including the overall commander of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Army General Alexander Dvornikov, though the allegations couldn't be independently confirmed.

A report from Christo Grozev, the lead Russia journalist for investigative outlet Bellingcat, claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to replace Dvornikov after hearng reports of his ""excessive drinking"" and a lack of trust in him by Russian forces.

>2. Attack the content not the source.

I'm trying to understand this exchange. The Daily Mail is a trash source. The Times, although I don't normally read it, is a proper newspaper, perhaps a bit right-wing for my tastes. It may have a very British slant but isn't a tabloid, and does not appear to just make shit up. So that's the first commentator.

That said, I live in a land filled with active mis- and dis-information, and the source is most certainly reason to attack a story. If the NY Post prints it, it's sensationalist fear-mongering bullshit  every single time, and even if large portions of the story will be true, one can assume from the get-go that important context will be omitted and spurious claims will be amplified to pursue nakedly political ends (and stoke fear, which seems papers, apparently).

Soldiers can be shot at and be forced to retreat, leaving the system without guidance).

GPS-only guidance just doesn't work against a moving target.

*. Tanks can move off road -- Roads are better of course, but tanks can swerve off the road and zigzag if they know they're being shelled. Other vehicles at least stay on the road, so you kinda sorta know where to aim.

*. Armor -- Obviously a direct hit of a 200-lb bomb would penetrate any tank armor. But what about 50-meters away? 20-meters away? Thick armor means that a ""near miss"" is far closer compared to unarmored or lightly-armored targets.

Proposing that Ukranians are losing manpower at 10 times the rate of the West? Implying the the economy in the West is somehow worse than in Russia just because Russia is artificially propping up their currency as if that's all that mattered? I'm not sure which claim is more absurd.

The situation on the ground is that militarily the Rashists have lost and are still losing at worst at a similar pace. They're probably still facing heavier losses, but deferring to that potentially being propaganda I'll say maybe losses of soldiers are somewhat close.

Which fits with the results on the ground. Russia's offensive is stalling out. They're making tiny slow gains in a few places while they've actually lost more ground than they've gained in the last month.

Meanwhile, since Russia is afraid of it becoming unpopular if they call a general mobilization, they're much more limited in their ability to replace fallen soldiers. What they have is mostly what they've got, while Ukraine continues to recruit and train new soldiers.

Economy vs economy, it all hinges on the longevity of Western support. Us side if the Rs win and the putin crowd gets a say this could be soon. On the eu side the national elections have little say on the overall level of support but much to say about individual national shipments of weapons and aid.

If the eu does not flinch, Russia is cooked, after 2 or 3 years of war and at the price of several hundred thousand Ukrainian casualties and total infrastructure devastation.

I think the eu will push for Ukraine eu integration before too many political motivations and electoral considerations can stop it. Russia is now an existential threat to Europe, those at the top know it.

Also, there is a lot of anti eu propaganda especially in the British brexit press that gets seen a lot, because of its anxiety inducing headlines and the fact it publishes in English. So you see a lot of articles about us and UK weapon systems, but very little stats about overall contributions.

And statistics are a bit all over there place (and varies a lot depending on demographic), but for younger Russians anti-war sentiments seem to be prevailing. But even if it hypothetically were a ridiculously low percentage such as 0.7%, that still means that 1,000,000 innocent anti-war Russians would be put at risk and become victimized which would run counter to every relevant value of the civilized, modern ideal that democratic, western societies strive for.

As for actual statistics, it's a bit difficult to find good sources, but Kamil Galeev has posted some in the past:

https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1527722915973963776

https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1509977958592749582

Roughly 15~40% being against the war depending on the demographic (age, wealth, etc). And the percentage of undecided/refused-to-answer/etc is in a slightly smaller but similar range. That means that in this data only half of the the polled were for the war, and out of these 2/3rds to 5/6ths were strongly pro-war. (One factor to keep in mind though, of course, is that a lot of people are under a lot of pressure to""tow the party line"" since they risk a lot retribution both from the state and from crazed nationalists otherwise, which adds an uncertain amount of bias towards pro-war opinions. Either way, according to the graphs shown it seems like approximately half of the population are pro-war if we extrapolate from the data Kamil shows, in which case that would indicate that ~72,000,000 Russians are not pro-war. (Of course, the public opinion may have shifted since or the polls may not be a decent enough sample to make any accurate extrapolations from; but even so there's still a 100% chance that there are millions of innocent people there that would be put at grave risk.)",1655984735.0,1655966238.0,t3_vinu1t,t1_ideb17v,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

For example if Turkey decided to invade the rest of Cyprus (which is in the EU but not in NATO), it's unlikely that the EU would all declare war on Turkey and conduct a military operation.

I should like the Wargame series (European Escalation, Air-Land Battle, & Red Dragon) by Eugen because it’s pretty good and very detailed, but I can’t keep up with it.

Anyway for simulation check out Cold Waters and War on the Sea, both by the indie developer Killerfish Games. 

-CW is a sub simulator mainly focused on Tom Clancy-esque Cold War North Atlantic and South China Sea campaigns, and it’s really good.

-WotS is a naval strategy/sim hybrid focused so far on the 1942 Guadalcanal USN versus Japan campaign, with a dedicated modder community. 

-KF also made an earlier game called Atlantic Fleet which is older and has somewhat rudimentary UI, but is worth it if you really want the WWII Britain versus Germany experience.

Another sim I haven’t played yet but am following is Gunner, HEAT, PC!, it’s a tank simulator currently in development with a demo available, it aims to be single-player War Thunder without the BS. 

For strategy, I also love and recommend Panzer Corps. It’s a hex-based reboot of the 90’s era Panzer General series with refreshed graphics, UI, and game mechanics, with multiple campaigns focused on the German, Soviet, and UK/US sides of WW2. 

Last one for strategy/tactics: Doorkickers 1&2, they’re both squad-level tactical close-quarter-battle sims reminiscent of the original Rainbow 6 and SWAT games. 1 is police/SWAT and 2 is US special forces in AKA-istan and they’re both pretty detailed and challenging.",False,1656015130.0,t3_vinu1t,t1_idgwzbx,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Yes, Russia is firing a lot more shells, that doesn't mean they're proportionately killing that many more. Because they have so many shells, Russia can afford to be much more indiscriminate in their shelling. They use them to level town and murder civilians. They may even fire them off in the general direction of Ukrainians just to try to affect morale with limited effect otherwise.

Meanwhile, Ukraine focuses on using their shells to kill enemy soldiers. And they're doing it quite effectively. They have the advantage of being on their home terrain (and may have pre-sighted equipment against landmarks.) They have western intel supporting them and telling them the most effective places to target.

They also have some of the longer range artillery having arrived, as you've already admitted. It's not exactly a stretch to believe they could kill more with less.

As for the gains, I hate to trivialize that suffering of the Ukrainians that are effected, but a look at the map shows how slow Russia's advance this month has been, and those gains have only slowed as the month progressed.

Meanwhile, Ukraine keeps freeing towns in other fronts, such as around Kherson.

The reality that the might of the Russian Army (the second in the world) can only manage this after nearly two and a half months doesn't inspire much confidence for the Russian military in the future.
