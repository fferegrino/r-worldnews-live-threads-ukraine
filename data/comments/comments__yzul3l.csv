Day 270 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another pretty quiet day, because Russians shifted their priority from shelling Kharkiv (the city) to shelling Kharkiv oblast, so towns like Izyum/Kupiansk/Chuhuiv. Though I honestly have no idea how they are shelling Chuhuiv, but not Kharkiv, because Chuhuiv is about 10km farther from the border with Russia than Kharkiv at the closest point, so it doesn‚Äôt really make much sense.

Very recently, at about 11pm, they also bombed the town Shevchenkove in Kupiansk district. They hit someone‚Äôs house as usual. Right now we don‚Äôt know if there are any casualties, but some people might be trapped under the rubble. Do they just completely ignore any military targets and only target civilians now? If so, then this is incredibly stupid, they are not fighting against civilians, so targeting them will only make us hate Russians more. It will absolutely never make us go against our government, they are not the ones bombing us, but I guess Russians think that we can‚Äôt see who is actually killing us and who is our real enemy, hint ‚Äì it‚Äôs not our government, it‚Äôs Russia.

In the morning we also had yet another massive air raid alert spanning the entire country, and considering that today is Monday, we thought that there would be another big missile strike aimed at our infrastructure, but thankfully it didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, they flew their bombers in Belarus, which is what triggered the air raid alert. This was clearly planned, they just don‚Äôt want us to relax.

 * Rishi Sunak visited Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, which just had a snowfall.  The UK is sending Ukraine a ¬£50m air defense package, including anti-aircraft guns.   

 * Lloyd Austin, US defense secretary, said that the US efforts support international law while actions by China and Russia express ‚Äúmight makes right.‚Äù   

 * Russia‚Äôs invasion has claimed a total of 437 Ukrainian children‚Äôs lives and injured 837 according to Ukraine‚Äôs prosecutor general.  The Donetsk region has been most affected. Information is still being gathered.   

 * Ukrainian shelling at the town of Mykhailkva resulted in the death of 60 Russian soldiers on Thursday.   

 * A Russian strike on a humanitarian station in the town of Bilozerka resulted in the injury of 5 people today.   

 * Mykhailo Podolyak, political adviser to Zelensky, dismisses rumors on Twitter about Ukraine surrendering.   

 * Russia‚Äôs targeting of energy infrastructure is resulting in hours-long blackouts.  Some neighborhoods of Kyiv are without electricity as the snow falls.  Maxim Timchenko, chief executive of Ukraine‚Äôs largest energy firm, suggests that Ukrainians remain outside of the country due to power shortages.  Of its pre-invasion population of 300k people, about 220k Kherson residents are currently displaced.    
> If they can find an alternative place to stay for another three or four months, it will be very helpful to the system.   

 * The first passenger train from Kyiv to newly liberated Kherson [just completed its journey]( https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/first-ukrainian-passenger-train-rolls-into-newly-freed-kherson-2022-11-19/).   

 * Ukraine‚Äôs deputy defense minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, says that Ukrainian military could be in Crimea by the end of December.  This was said in an [interview](https://news.sky.com/video/we-can-step-in-crimea-by-the-end-of-december-says-ukraines-deputy-defence-minister-12750730) with Sky News.   

 * Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian presidential chief of staff, says that peace talks may not take place until Russia completely withdraws its forces.  The statement was shared at the Halifax International Security Forum.  

 * According to an intelligence report from the UK Ministry of Defence, Russia just made its largest single-day issuance of debt, which sustains military spending.   

 * A funeral was held today for one of the two Polish men who were killed by the missile that struck a grain storage facility near Przewodow.  

 * ‚ÄúMost‚Äù of the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation contributed to a summit statement condemning the war in Ukraine. Some expressed differing views of the situation or sanctions.   

 * The Conflict Observatory, a war crimes research group from Yale University, said that hundreds of Ukrainians were abducted during the Russian occupation of Kherson.  They‚Äôve documented 226 of them. They estimate that a quarter of these captives experienced torture, and at least 4 were killed while in Russian detention.

Look at it like this. The US has a reputation, somewhat deserved, of being entirely too willing to prosecute wars, and entirely too unable to know when to give up. Some US citizens are sensitive to this fact. So they are always concerned that options for ending the war not be ignored.

Therefore US leaders want to make it clear that they're open to the concept of peace negotiations. However, they know absolutely for sure that Russia isn't going to make any kind of reasonable offer. Putin can't accept peace, it means admitting he failed, and probably ends up  being executed in a dark room somewhere. So they have no expectation that an option to end the war will exist anytime soon. But by mentioning the concept, they avoid looking overeager.

Luck doesn't have anything to do with it, Ukraine (pre-conflict) was a modernized Western styled military while the Russian military was still adhering to the old Soviet ideologies.

Just look at the 2014 conflict to see the difference. That conflict was a large incompetent Soviet styled Russian military vs a small incompetent Soviet styled Ukrainian military. Russia steamrolled Ukraine pretty easily.

While Russia spent the next 8 years preparing for a second major war against a small incompetent Soviet styled military, Ukraine spent that time modernizing. They sent their promising NCOs to military school in NATO countries. They were trained in small team tactics by the Green Berets. They were given firsthand accounts of tactics the Taliban used that were successful which Ukraine might use in similar situations.

When the conflict started the Ukrainian military had, essentially, just Javelins and Stingers and that's it. With those Western weapons, and their revamped military tactics and organization, they fought the Russians to a standstill outside of Kyiv (preventing its takeover) and forced Russia to retreat. Once they demonstrated they had the motivation and capability to repel Russia, they were given better weapons (e.g., Howitzers, armored personnel carriers, etc) and then eventually HIMARS.",False,1668940976.0,t3_yzul3l,t1_ix2xj05,,3,17,0,17,0,0,

Not necessarily.

We don't know what happened because there's no video and no statement from anyone involved.

One of the reasons that this a very serious crime is precisely because it is no longer reasonable for those receiving a surrender to consider the apparent surrenderers to be non-combatants, they may have been intentionally acting as bait. 

There may be circumstances when they can continue to be treated as such, if they have apparently been neutralised and the capturing side believe they will retain control of the situation but that is almost impossible to assert or expect in a combat situation.

Well, they did surrender - atleast they acted like they did. The act of surrendering has nothing to do with the procedure afterwards which is what the comment above is claiming. That guy is confusing safety measures while taking the POWs in with ""you gotta do this, you have no POW protection until you have followed these exact steps""

Kh-55 is a nuclear cruise missile. Kh-555 is a modification of it equipped with conventional warhead and GLONASS receiver, needed for precision delivery of conventional payload. 

For training purposes they have to launch a number of nuclear missiles, however it would be inconvenient at least to have w nuclear blast. Also it will be difficult to analyze how precision the strike was. So some if the Kh-55s were made for this purposes - no explosive warhead at all, just ballast. Otherwise it's just a Kh-55 (some sources are saying it has additional logging devices for later analysis). 

Basically they don't sacrifice anything using them as decoys in the first wave just to saturate air defense. They already have it, they are old and they have Ukrainian made jet engines, which need to be serviced every few years, and they look exactly like Kh-555 (they have the same airframe), so you cannot just ignore them.
