Day 78 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was definitely quieter than yesterday. The city itself wasn’t shelled, but nearby settlements did. Mala Danylivka and Derhachy were shelled and sadly one person died. We even heard Derhachy being shelled from where we are, as it is only 5 km away from us. It is still dangerous around here and we can’t let our guard down, but it is certainly much quieter than it was before.

A lot of people are returning to Kharkiv now, today streets were extremely lively; there are almost as many people now as there were before the war. Apparently our mayor said that even when we were being shelled daily, there were still about 1 million people staying in the city, and now more are returning.

But with around 25% of all residential buildings in the city being destroyed a lot of returning people don’t even have a home anymore. Most of Saltivka is in ruins, and that district alone houses over 400 000 people, Northern Saltivka doesn’t have even a single undamaged building and many other districts are also badly damaged, so much pointless destruction.

About why we still talk to some people from Russia, we usually don’t, but it just so happens that most of the people we knew before the war were Russians, so because they are still in our friend lists they sometimes talk to us. We also still sometimes talk to our relatives from Russia, but they don’t really care about us that much, some of them even defend Putin and their “Z” being plastered on everything. 

One thing they all have in common is that they always say “let’s stay friends” while at the same time they are basically saying that this war is completely justified. No, let’s not be friends, how can you support this war and still be friends with us – “the Nazis”? Though we still don’t block them so we can read all the bullshit they constantly write.

One of them even wrote to us before Easter saying that if anything gets shelled on Easter that is the work of your Nazis. What was their source? Russian MOD of course, the beacon of truth, that same MOD that said that our army was using “Bandera Automobiles” and black magic.

Their propaganda always manages to make us laugh, so that’s one good thing it does. Today their RIA Novosti posted another masterpiece. This time they said that a captured Ukrainian soldier told them that *he was locked up in a dog cage for a day for speaking Russian*. Who even comes up with this shit?

The plan aims to integrate Ukrainian and EU infrastructure to mobilize 20 million metric tons of grain that must leave Ukraine within three months, EU Commissioner for Transport Adina Vălean said in the release. 

“Thousands” of trucks and wagons are stuck on the Ukrainian side of many EU borders, with an average waiting time of 16 days to pass through — rising to 30 days at some borders — the commission said.  

The commission is urging freight and infrastructure managers to take steps to streamline Ukrainian exports, such as making more vehicles available and prioritizing time slots.

National authorities are also being asked to apply “maximum flexibility” to “accelerate procedures at border crossing points” and work to secure more capacity for storing Ukrainian exports temporarily. 

The export blockade — resulting from the war with Russia — in addition to incidents of grain theft, reportedly at the hands of Russian forces, are causing a global supply crisis of grains such as wheat and corn.

""**The Russians were defeated again in Belogorovka: about 70 units of equipment - scrap metal**

MAZURENKO ALYONA - THURSDAY, MAY 12, 2022, 22:39

The head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, Serhiy Haidai, said that on May 12, the Armed Forces of Ukraine once again destroyed the Russian pontoon crossings across the Seversky Donets, and eliminated enemy personnel and equipment. 

Source : Serhiy Haidai , head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration

Direct speech: ""Our new"" Chornobaivka ""is Belogorivka, where the occupiers are trying to overthrow pontoon crossings, overturn equipment and personnel. There is a unique situation, they climb like sheep to the same places. 

Our Armed Forces break up pontoon crossings, equipment and personnel. There are just dozens of units of armored personnel carriers, tanks and trucks lying around. This can already be seen with the naked eye. ""

Details : According to him, Belogorovka is hell for Russians.

Gaidai added that about 70 units of equipment had been destroyed and dozens of occupiers eliminated. 

He said that on May 12, the occupiers tried all day to break through in Komyshuvash and Rubezhnoye, but without success. The battles for Voivodivka continue.

In addition, according to him, in the Luhansk region, the National Guard shot down a Russian Ka-52 helicopter.

He also said that the Russian occupation was hell for Ukrainians. Yes, in Popasna, Russians are shooting people for their love for Ukraine. 

In particular, they can take their lives for a Ukrainian picture on their phone, and Ukrainian activists are simply disappearing.

Gaidai said that on May 12, rubber trucks were brought to Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and the village of Popasnyanska OTG: ""The driver who came under fire the day before yesterday (May 10), today (May 12) got behind the wheel again.""""

Joint statement by the President of the Republic and Prime Minister of Finland on Finland’s NATO membership  
Office of the President of the Republic of Finland  
Prime Minister’s Office  
Press release 30/2022  
12 May 2022  
  
During this spring, an important discussion on Finland’s possible NATO membership has taken place. Time has been needed to let Parliament and the whole society establish their stands on the matter. Time has been needed for close international contacts with NATO and its member countries, as well as with Sweden. We have wanted to give the discussion the space it required.  
  
Now that the moment of decision-making is near, we state our equal views, also for information to the parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.

Long version:

Since its formation the USSR and subsequently Russia have always siphoned off the resources of the ethnic non-russian parts of the empire to enrich the russian core. While surpressing (I'm being way to generous here) these same non-russian cultures and even their right to self rule. Breakup of the USSR crippled russia's economy which inturn created political turmoil that putin was able to expolit. Putins willingness to trade russian economic resources for political support created the kleptocrarcy that lined both the oligarchs and his pockets, while stiffling Russia's economic growth. Over the years he has solidified his position (dictatorship) and no longer needs the oligarchs to hold power, consequently they are now beholden to him, or risk imprisionment and siezure of their wealth

The FALSE notion that Ukraine is just a breakaway state resulting from the USSR's breakup falls back on this history. (i.e. Its just another satillite state who's only purpose is to be a russian vassal). What putin missed is Ukraine has its own history including two revolutions against authoritian rule, and russian puppet leadership. It has been 30+ years since independence, and clearly the Ukrainian people have no desire to return to anything resembling the USSR era. In the long run a prosperus and western leaning Ukriane is an exestential threat to putin, but not russia itself.

Its hard too see how this all plays out. But I think some things are already clear. Ukraine has secured its sovereignty, but (for now) not all its bordrers. NATO has a been strenghtened with a renewed purpose, and appears to be on the brink of expanding its membership. The notion of appeasement is perhaps now completely discredited. You can't bargin with a narsistic dictator, becuase their promises are good for only as long as they see the benefit to them.

putin has launched russia into a downward spiral, it will only accelerate as long as the conflict continues. Not clear how (or even if) this can be reversed. All this death/pain/suffering/destruction/and possibly famine because one little/old/narsistic man obtained too much power and answers to noone. putin has cemented his legacy in history alongside Hitler and Stalin.

In contrast Zelensky has shown the world what it means to be a real leader. Lots of western democracies should take note, and expect more (better) from our own leaders.

This happened back in early March, and I believe it's the first major ship sinking that was argued to be false. I never got involved with this story when it was out, but it was suggested I should do a deep dive on it. Afterwards, I'll do the Makarov. As a caveat, remember that certain tweets won't show up in my filter.

Anyway, here is the Twitter filter I used to search for relevant tweets: 

Vasily Bykov min_faves:100

I then searched by recent. Funnily enough, the oldest tweet I found was by OSINT Defender on March 7th, who is now extremely skeptical of any ship attack. 

https://twitter.com/sentdefender/status/1500759177454628864?s=20&t=w7UKIV-OPwzypVMbgZ4Lqg

Notice how it's a night video and not stated as an intelligence source or a government source. 

Verified Twitter Ukrainian Taras Chmut, appears to be one of the early Twitter sources as well: 
https://mobile.twitter.com/TarasChmut/status/1500795604712275968

I found an older article on March 7th saying that the head of the Odessa region military said the Vasily sunk: https://dumskaya.net/news/russkmy-korabl-idinahuy-voenno-morskie-sily-ukra-160902/

This was cited much later on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1500891309653037057?s=20&t=w7UKIV-OPwzypVMbgZ4Lqg

Note that there's two source links in those articles that you have to go back to find the one I linked. 

Now later on March 16th the ship was confirmed still floating. This is the oldest tweet that claimed that the Vasily was safe back in Sevastopol: 

https://twitter.com/Medios_Rusos/status/1504110923967049729?s=20&t=w7UKIV-OPwzypVMbgZ4Lqg

Notice how the ship identification is clearly visible. However, the recent Makarov ""evidence"" doesn't have a ship identification because the Russians painted over it. So it's not as easy to identify. 

Back to the Vasily, the video was shared by Rob Lee who is very good at verifying video. https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1504389226619719682?s=20&t=w7UKIV-OPwzypVMbgZ4Lqg

Funnily enough, this is the last and ONLY English language tweet that claims the Vasily made it back to port. 
In addition, no tweet matching my filter has been posted since April 13th, when the Moskva sank: 

https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1514399796307668993?s=20&t=w7UKIV-OPwzypVMbgZ4Lqg

Now there are some people who misspelled the ship. This time I used the filters

Vasiliy Bykov min_faves:100
Vasiliy Bukov min_faves:100
Vasily Bukov min_faves:100

And only one Twitter account matched the filters: Granger. He first used the misspelling here on March 16th: https://twitter.com/GrangerE04117/status/1504071814519029764?s=20&t=xxdirNH20wZIbuwJ0eMa8g

On March 28th, he posted the latest alleged photo of the Vasily Bykov with its identification removed. https://twitter.com/GrangerE04117/status/1508648231110340609?s=20&t=xxdirNH20wZIbuwJ0eMa8g

#Summary

It is possible that the Vasily Bykov was hit, as shown in earlier photos and video, but not sunk. It had almost 10 days to repair some damage before it was allegedly photographed in one piece. It's unclear if the photo and video of the intact ship are of the right time. It's possible the ship has indeed sunk.

**Vladimir Putin’s Historical Disinformation**

(...)

*Putin attempts to manipulate history to alter the future. He uses visceral imagery of World War II to tap into deep-seated emotions for his disinformation campaign about Ukraine in order to achieve geopolitical goals. Carnegie Moscow Senior Fellow Andrei Kolesnikov wrote, “The regime seeks to restore the country’s lost empire—in the public mind at least—through these historical reimaginings.” Experts and historians agree the Kremlin’s portrayal of history is often misleading and attempts to serve its current political agenda.*

*8. In \~20 minutes after recon unit confirmed Russian bridge being mounted, HEAVY ARTILLERY engaged against Russian forces, and then aviation chipped in as well.*

*I was still in the area, and I have never seen / heard such heavy combat in my life.*

*After one day of combats, 9th May morning the bridge was down. Some Russian forces (\~30-50 vehicles + infantry) were stuck on Ukrainian side of the river with no way back. They tried to run away using broken bridge. Then they tried to arrange a new bridge.*

I mean, a huge fucking portion of US / NATO training is ""trust your men on the ground"", and ""a lot of it is up to them"".

The details matter more than grand battle plans in many cases. The time for coaching was a long time ago, its up to the Ukrainian commanders and NCOs now.

------

That being said, US intelligence is quite good. So USA is almost certainly sharing things like ""Russians are massing over here, you might want to deal with that...""

But if you're talking about like, where troops should hide themselves or expect where the enemy will attack on the battle map, that's lower level than ""leadership"" for sure. Could be as low as the squad level even. If a squad-leader sees something that the commanders doesn't know about, its up to the squad-leader to deviate from the plan and try to do something creative and new, and try to make it work out anyway.

Internal propaganda is not meant for external observers. It's not even meant for internal people with  some critical thinking ability. It's meant for people who are easily swayed by populism, and that's a majority in every single country. It's even a majority on reddit (the 'polonium tea' joke brigade who don't really have anything to contribute other than threadbare jokes and angry oneliners). That is the type of people they want, because those people can be easily whipped into frenzy, and once they thirst for blood, they don't really question their own righteousness or really care about anybody who isn't them and their tribe.

As long as the government keeps a tight hold on that part of the society, they're fine. These people will eat critical thinkers alive, you just need to point them towards them and cry 'traitor!'

They want that fire in their mouths. And boy howdy is the Russian propaganda machine giving it to them. Just like our own propaganda is appealing to the same type of people within our own 'side'. 

Of course, even if you think that you're a thinker who could see through propaganda, and know how propaganda works, none of us are immune. Not me, not you, nobody.  Some are just more easy to manipulate into doing your job for you.

The mob that did this hope that putin will help them get to power there, as they presented themselves as more loyal than the current “government” - which has ties to russia, but is more independent than even Belarus probably. 

The power there is held by Sheriff “corporation “ - who own all major businesses, including thr football team who beat Real Madrid, they do business with EU through Moldova, and they don’t want any shit going on.

Our Government (Moldova) discussed with them, they basically said “guys, pls ignore this, nothing against you”, but at the same time they had to blame Ukraine to 

1) not admit that there are some extremists and their power is contested
2) do russia a favor, because they still get some money from there

A senior US defense official stated on May 9 that the US has not observed any indicators of a “new major Russian mobilization” and that members of the private military company Wagner Group “urgently” requested hundreds of thousands of additional troops to reinforce Russian efforts in Donbas. The official noted that Russia currently has 97 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, but that BTGs have been moving in and out of Ukraine to refit and resupply, suggesting that Russian troops continue to sustain substantial damage in combat. **ISW has previously assessed that most Russian BTGs are heavily degraded and counting BTGs is not a useful metric of Russian combat power.** The Main Ukrainian Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claimed that under-trained, ill-equipped Russian conscripts are still being sent into active combat despite the Kremlin denying this practice. A prisoner of war from the BARS-7 detachment of the Wagner Group claimed that a ”covert mobilization” is underway in Russian to send conscripts to clean damage caused by combat in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-updates)",False,1652350990.0,t3_uns9id,t1_i8ardp9,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

1. **Increase the security of the Russian State** by reducing EU solidarity / halting expansion of NATO and EU influence in former Soviet states and other border states.  This would include maintaining Finland's neutrality, retaining Belarus as a stable puppet regime, retaining Khazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan as pliable satellite states, and preventing Ukraine from becoming a destabilizing influence in all of that.  In this, Russia has failed spectacularly.   The EU and NATO are more unified than before, Finland and Sweden are submitting applications to join.  the Central Asian republics have refused to participate in this invasion and moved to distance themselves, and Belarus has done everything it can to stay out of active combat while making supportive noises to the Kremlin.
2. **Bring Ukraine back under Russian domination.**  This would have included a decapitation strike against Kyiv, removing Zelenskyy and other top leaders, and replacing them with Yanukovich and other Russia-friendly leaders.  Russia has permanently failed spectacularly in this objective and will not achieve it ever again.
3. **Neutralize Ukraine as a long-term political, military, and economic threat.**  This would have likely included stripping away the bulk of its manufacturing, trade, and agricultural centers in the East and South, leaving a landlocked ""rump state"" in the West that mostly bordered Belarus, Romania, and Poland.   In order to achieve this, Russia had to control all of Ukraine East of the Dnieper and the entire Black Sea coast including Odessa and Mykolaiv.  Russia has permanently failed spectacularly in this objective.  They failed to take Odessa and Mykolaiv.  They failed to occupy the major population centers in the North, Central, and Eastern portions of Ukraine also (Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhaporzhzhya, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad).
4. **Create a ""Land Corridor"" and buffer for Crimea, and retain the Sea of Azov as a ""Russian"" sea.**  This required taking the entire Azov Seacoast from Kherson Oblast all the way through Mariupol.  Russia has as of this moment succeeded in this, but it is unclear whether they can retain this land corridor.
5. **Secure the entirety of the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts.**  They are currently working on this, and making SOME progress.  They control almost all of Luhansk Oblast (except basically the area around Sevierodonetsk/Lysychansk) and about half of Donetsk Oblast.  It is currently a race to see if they run out of men and equipment and break before they can complete this objective.  Verdict:  Possible but not guaranteed in the short term.  Could end up a long, drawn out conflict.
6. **Negotiate permanent recognition of Crimea as Russian territory.**  If Russia can manage nothing else, they would prefer to use items #3 and #4 as leverage to negotiate Ukrainian recognition of Crimea as legally Russian territory.  Frankly I see this as the most possible actual result of this whole war, but even that is questionable.

So looking at all of that, Russia has failed miserably at their ""top line"" objectives 1 through 3.  They are in a race to see if they can squeeze out objectives 4 and 5 before they collapse, and may end up having to console themselves with objective 6.

The cost to Russia of all of this?  A unified Europe that hates their guts, a devastated economy, a humiliated and gutted military, tends of thousands of their own citizens dead and some multiple of that permanently disfigured, and the rise of a unified, angry, motivated, and very inventive state on their southern border.

In the big picture, Ukraine has already won the war: they have ensured their survival as an independent nation, won the respect and allegiance of other Western powers, and will have support in rebuilding after the conflict.

Similarly, Russia has already lost: they've irrecoverably failed their initial war aims, suffered painful economic isolation, and humiliated themselves on the world stage. Russia is no longer able to pretend - even as weakly as they did before - they are a world power or successor state to the USSR. They're a corruption-ridden, militarily-incompetent regional power who will see their influence wane against the rising stars of local rivals like China and India.

That isn't to say Russia won't achieve some limited 'wins' in Ukraine; it remains probable they will maintain occupation of some additional territory within Ukraine. Much of the south and east of Ukraine remains at significant risk of Russian occupancy and unrecognized annexation. How much of a loss is this for Ukraine? That's an impossible question to answer, and only the hindsight of history will attempt a plausible answer. (While for Ukrainians in these regions, it's an awful loss.) 

Yet even if Russia succeeds in holding these regions over the near or medium term, they're going to have extreme difficulty in doing so for the long term. Ukraine will not forgive and forget, and Russia's increasingly-diminished economy will have a very hard time maintaining an annexation. After Putin's rule ends, there would be strong incentives for his successor to exit the quagmire he's created for Russia. If the next Russian leader is sane, they may well look at occupied Ukraine - much as successor Presidents of the USA looked at Afghanistan - and ask ""what the fuck are we still doing here?""",False,1652372007.0,t3_uns9id,t1_i8bsij6,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

A hetman was the highest military officer in the hetmanates area of Ukraine, the Zaporizhian Host (1649–1764), and the Ukrainian State (1918). The title was used by Ukrainian Cossacks from the 16th century. It was the title of the second-highest military commander in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 16th to 18th centuries.

Whether you are concerned with humanitarian issues or have a purely nationalist world view, this is a good investment. 

There is virtually nothing America could do domestically with $40 billion that will have close to the humanitarian impact or even domestic impact as its support for Ukraine.

Ukraine has a population of 44 million people. Almost a third of them are currently displaced. If Ukraine loses, over half that number (22 million) will likely become refugees. A lot of those will try to make their way to the United States, while others will stay in Europe. This will put an enormous strain on humanitarian supports. 

Meanwhile, part of the strategy of the Russian military is to take out Ukraine's food production capacity. This will certainly cause a global food price spike, the effect of which will be felt by Americans. 

It will also lead to a deterioration of the global security environment, and likely help fuel major resurgences of global terrorist organizations, especially in food-import-dependent Muslim nations. The Arab Spring and the rise of ISIS followed quickly on the heels of a massive spike in bread prices in North Africa and the Middle East. Ukraine provides a major portion of the grain North Africa uses to feed itself. Russia's continued degradation of Ukraine's agricultural capacity will likely cause serious food price spikes throughout the broader region and will destabilize the political situation in a way that will effect American interests and revenues. This destabilization will likely lead to further fuel price spikes and dangerous wars, which will put further strain on what matters most to you.

Like it or not, America, Canada and Europe are linked in a global economy, global supply chains and share global security concerns that, as we have all had to learn the hard way a few times, cannot be ignored without consequence.

If that were safe and feasible, it would still add up to 10 hours of driving and a ferry crossing to what would otherwise be a much shorter trip. Plus border checkpoints to contend with, since neither Bulgaria nor Romania, despite being in the EU, are part of the Schengen agreement. 

They could, perhaps, re-route trucks to the riverport at Izmail (again, assuming that the corridor is safe) and then ship goods up the Danube to Central Europe. But I don't think the river can handle larger capacity grain ships ships (depth, bridges, narrows, canal locks with 1-ship capacity, etc.) to fully substitute for a proper seaport, so it would be an jumbled mess of smaller barge traffic. And I don't know if Izmail has the facilities needed to containerize grain coming off of trucks from farms or warehouses. Or if the river has sufficient capacity. I saw a report that said Ukraine's backlog of grain held up by the blockade at Odessa is 25m tons. The Danube usually sees a total of 15m tons of traffic per year.

Let's say they could do all that and handle the capacity - that would get shipments as far as Nuremburg/Bamburg (the last major river ports in the system) before deciding if they're going to offload to trucks again or continue through lower capacity canals to the Main/Rhine and then ultimately to Rotterdam or something where it would be reloaded once again on ocean-going ships. 

You run into similar problems if you try to go Northwest towards Poland instead. Lviv to Gdansk is a 10 hour drive, assuming that the Ukraine-Poland border crossing is a breeze and not congested by military operations and other shipping already picking up the slack from the closed Russian/Belarussian borders. There is a plan to connect the Vistula river to via a Narew–Bug–Mukhovets–Pripyat–Dnieper, but that would require dredging and passing through Belarus, so river shipping really isn't an option either.

So danger, time, complexity, and cost for the shipment of perishable goods is not a good mix for prices. It may not be economical to ship it that way at all.

But the real problem isn't just that there aren't alternate routes. It's that the alternate routes can't ramp up fast enough to get grain/corn out of storage in time to make room for the next harvest. Which means production goes down.

The US is responsible for roughly 50% of all global grain exports. We have so fucking much we have absolutely no reason to take all of Ukraine's. And American farmers would be super pissed if Biden just flooded the market with discount Ukrainian grain. 

That said, if we could assist Ukraine with exporting the grain it doesn't need to feed its own people then America would be helping a great many countries which rely on Ukrainian grain imports. That's something you don't generally think about, but I'm sure many countries (Egypt and China for example) rely on Ukrainian grain imports.

And you're right, this is just more projection from Russia since they'd ABSOLUTELY steal as much grain as they can for Putin's inner circle to profit.

The only thing that matters for a lot of these people is avoiding a situation where US is the monopolar global hegemon. Presumably because then they'd be too powerful to ever be fucked with or challenged in any way. As apposed to how it is now where the left cant even wrestle power away from the centrists in the labor, or democratic parties. 

It comes from the line or reasoning that completely overthrowing the the current order is the only way to have the freedom to act against the power of capital. It ignores the fact that capitalism is actually really good for state power. It makes the state stronger, makes the industrial capacity, and the military stronger. Its ability to finance its projects easier. Like theres a reason why its conquered the world, and theres a reason why the CCP couldn't wait to start using it once Mao was out of the way. 

In a world where the marxist revolution took hold in Germany in 1919, and they managed to take the whole of europe by mid century, I cant imagine any outcome but a bunch of bickering, separate marxist states who would inevitably start fighting with each other, or even just competing with each other. And just like the Chinese, they'd eventually circle back to ""we should use capitalism to achieve our political goals.""

Working people throughout history have always wanted to keep what they produce, and enjoy freedom. Decentralizing power and resources is preferable to having a society built around a handful of people.

Somehow, for many who post here, someone just discussing something that appears or just *risks* to be going right for Russia, is equal to trolling, disingenuous, or ""saber rattling"" as you put it (I don't really understand that expression used in this context though). 

Meanwhile, we have people overreacting to grand rumors of 2000 dead russians in a convoy north of Kharkiv a couple weeks ago. Or, the Makarev being sunk, and when reasonable voices point out we should probably remain calm and it seemed to have started as a rumor that picked up speed, those voices are trolls and the boat is burning and sinking and is a submarine and so on. 

Or yesterday, the amount of people who posted about the ""up to 1500 casualties"" in the pontoon bridge mayhem, without even stopping to think twice about that number? Like, fine go ahead and believe anything positive for Ukraine. But if that bridge crossing *had gone right* for the russians, just imagine the crap someone would have had to take if they brought it up or asked about what future threats it could pose. 

We have a huge double standard in here and I think it becomes a problem for giving a fair picture. Any negative news is instantly brigaded by the most vocal people and downvoted, and what we're left with is only the stuff that is positive for Ukraine. 

Today or yesterday I saw someone justify downvoting anything that even has information about russian successes, unless the posts include explanations of why those successes do not matter. Like, completely seriously.

US invading Iraq was about alleged WMDs and removing a despot. The same people see it as trying to get a US puppet into government. It was more making sure there wasn’t a new and unreliable nuclear player. 

The US never had an intention to erase Iran and it’s culture from existence. 

To conflate this goal of harm reduction though regime change with imperialism is rubbish.

I personally believe the US should not have been there, but even so, the US invasion was not an unreasonable action against a perceived existential threat. Even if it turned out to be largely based on dubious information peddled by the Bush government, the goal wasn’t imperialism.

The stuff about Ukraine joining NATO as an existential threat to Russia is rubbish. Ukraine being part of NATO would only be an issue if Russia wanted to invade it.

From what I hear, that window is completely closed. As more stories of Russias atrocities come out from liberated areas, the Ukrainian population will never accept anything less than a full victory including the complete eviction of Russia from Crimea. Even the suggestion of it at this point triggers instant threats that politicians suggesting so will be thrown. I don't think the option is even in Zelensky's playbook anymore. By all accounts, the Ukrainian people, and its full armed forces are now very much prepared to take what losses needed to militarily regain Crimea. Frankly, if Ukraine gets control over irs mainland again, that is horrible news for Russia, because resupplying Crimea will effectively only be possible through one route. A very long bridge. So while it may function as a fortress, it can be effectively blockaded, subjected to extreme artillery bombardment and finally inevitably ran over.

The regular balistic missiles fired from trucks, ships, and jets can be intercepted much more easily then an ICBM and have significantly worse range but still.

The bomb is reportedly similar to the US military's GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast which is often unofficially called ""Mother of All Bombs"" derived from its official military acronym ""MOAB"". This weapon would therefore be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world. However, the veracity of Russia's claims concerning the weapon's size and power have been questioned by US defense analysts"".

>I'm not against providing support, but there has to be a line.     
     
In general, this is an anchoring bias. It is a huge problem in human thinking. Dynamic variables exist. Every generation has lines. Your rationale was the same used during the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_insurrection_of_1898 regarding lines for racial group progress:      
    
>While thus numerically strong, the N--- is not a factor in the development of the city or section. With thirty years of freedom behind him and with an absolute equality of educational advantages with the whites, there is not today in Wilmington a single N--- savings bank or any other distinctively N--- educational or charitable institution; while the race has not produced a physician or lawyer of note. In other words, the N--- in Wilmington has progressed in very slight degree from the time when he was a slave. His condition can be summed up in a line. Of the taxes in the city of Wilmington and the county of New Hanover the whites pay 96 2/3rds per cent; while the N--- pay the remainder — 3 1/3rds per cent. The N--- in North Carolina, as these figures show, is thriftless, improvident, does not accumulate money, and is not accounted a desirable citizen.

It’s worth noting I am not familiar with any documented case of a bullet (incendiary or otherwise) igniting a gas tank.

This is a trope that’s so common in video games and movies it seems like it’s become ingrained in our understanding of reality, but as far as I can tell it’s a highly unlikely occurrence at best.  I know we all support Ukraine here but it’s naive to think only one side engages in propaganda.

Ukraine is in a situation where they most likely are not going to indiscriminately shell villages/towns/cities that Russia was able to take early on with little resistance. For example when it comes time to start taking back Kherson/Donbas/Luhansk. So for the people out there who assume these timelines are referring to the time it will take Ukraine to push Russia back to pre February borders, that’s highly unlikely. You’re going to have take these areas via  superior numerical force if you want to avoid as many civilian causalities as possible, and I assume they do.

In 1961 the magazine was acquired by The Washington Post Company and remained under its ownership until 2010. Between 2008 and 2012, Newsweek experienced financial difficulties, leading to the cessation of print publication and a transition to an all-digital format at the end of 2012.

But only part of the kernel is used for ethanol (the starch), the rest of the kernel, including the protein and fat, are then used to make another popular animal feed known as distillers grains.

> People don’t eat field corn directly from the field because it’s hard and certainly not sweet. Instead, field corn must go through a mill and be converted to food products and ingredients like corn syrup, corn flakes, yellow corn chips, corn starch or corn flour

Even if converted to corn flour, US processes will not get the maximum nutrition from it.  One would have to use traditional methods from Mexico and other parts of Latin America:

> The nixtamalization process is commonly utilized in the production of tortillas and other related maize-based food products. The maize kernels are cooked with alkali (i.e. lime) and steeped in the cooking water with subsequent washing, at least twice, ensuring the removal of any remaining organic components and excess alkali ...

> Remarkable physico-chemical changes occur in the maize during nixtamalization (resulting from heat treatment, lime addition and the steeping and grinding processes) which remarkably improve the nutritional quality of the maize. In particular, partial starch gelatinization, partial lipid saponification, solubilization of some proteins surrounding the starch granules and the conversion of the cell wall hemicellulose components into soluble gums all strongly influence the rheological and textural properties of the final products (Arámbula et al., 1999).",1652385362.0,1652385170.0,t3_uns9id,t1_i8cva2i,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

They have all been displaced by the purges within the Republican Party. The Tea Party and then Trump have largely taken over as the largest cohort of the GOP in the House. It is expected that the far-right crazies will dominate the House, although Dems will hold the Presidency (and likely the Senate, there's a lot of Republicans at risk of losing their seat).

This means that the US will have a divided Congress and essentially total gridlock. The House also has the ability to begin impeachment; they'll very likely try to impeach Biden if only to get revenge for Trump being impeached twice.

---

That's the conventional wisdom, at least. I actually don't personally think it's going to be as big of a pro-GOP bloodbath as we'd expect, for a couple of reasons:

* The revised electoral maps are actually [relatively similar to the current maps we have now.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/) Thus far, on paper Dems have gained 7 seats and Republicans have lost 3; however, in reality it's really a +1 gain for the GOP as the seats are being taken from swing districts and made ""safe"".

* The Census was taken during COVID, and specifically asked for the size of the family near the beginning of the pandemic. The Census is what all these lines are based on... but there have been 1 million deaths from COVID in the US since then. Most of those are in Republican areas.

* Assuming the Supreme Court strikes down Roe vs. Wade, GOP single-issue voters will be less energized - they got what they wanted - and Dems will be fired up. That issue alone will likely cause an ""enthusiasm gap"" which could be exploited.

The most plausible of your suggestions but the fact that Putin didn't do this yet makes me think he is running out of political influence. Further, still doesn't fix supply issues or equipment issues and is just going to send even less trained Russians to die. Maybe, eventually, after months of huge losses this might win out in the end but would leave Russia completely devastated after.

I  really recommend you look at Transnistria on a map, up close. It's completely undefendable on the Ukraine border and unsupplyable without first taking Odessa.

Look, It's an interesting physical scenario to contemplate, but if you respond like that just because people don't immediately defer to you declaring by fiat that it's implausible for a highly flammable liquid being splattered all over the place to catch fire in the very likely presence of a lot of sparks, well, that rather decreases the likelihood of anybody wanting to continue the conversation, you know?

There's actually a fair bit of academic work done on this issue, albeit mostly in the context of preventing combat aircraft fuel-fires as a result of them being shot at. A lot of work has gone into developing so-called anti-misting additives for jetfuel for that specific reason. Yes, again, liquid fuel is surprisingly difficult to ignite - nobody is contesting that - aerosolized fuel is very, very easy to combust. That's how an internal explosion engine *works*. All I'm saying is that I would expect a large volume of automatic gunfire impinging on a metal fuel tank to:

1) Result in a lot of small fuel droplets in atmospheric air, and

2) Produce sparks

The US airforce certainly agrees that [it's an issue](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0755361.pdf) worth spending time on.

Realistically?  Challenger or Abrams, yeah, wrecked.  There's a greater % of its surface the ATGM wouldn't be able to go through and the ammo is compartmentalized at the back, so it *may* be a tank loss but not a total crew loss, just, that turret rear is wasted.  Tank roofs are usually 2in thick or so; the modern Russian designs are probably the best optimized in the world to that threat and it's clearly not working.

Most Western equipment seems to have a proficiency curve that's pretty linear with dropoffs at the upper bound, like getting really good at a video game.  Most Eastern equipment, especially older, is much more front-loaded in complexity to *use*, and much less forgiving of minor tactical imperfections, as a side effect of low production cost.

As a concrete example, using tanks, an Abrams turret turns 45d off from the source of surprise fire, it's still covered by tons of composite armor, it's just slightly less than optimal.

e7b489d2ee483585d7c2c21dd0e4323a,uns9id,i8ateii,"To put into perspective a bit what Siemens' withdrawal from Russia means:

There are only 3 companies in the world that cover levels 1 to 3(4) of the automation pyramid, i.e. supply everything from field devices to control systems: Siemens, Emerson and Yokogawa. The withdrawal of one of these companies from a country would normally lead to the others filling the gaps. In this case, I rather assume that Emerson and Yokogawa will join shortly.

The other major automation companies, such as Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric and Honeywell, even if they stay in Russia, will not be able to cover everything, nor will they be able to fill the gap left by Siemens' withdrawal in the next few years.

Siemens is one of the few major automation companies that builds machines as well as control systems: Steam and water turbines, generators, transformers, frequency converters, electric motors (those are still the easiest to replace), switchgear for all voltage levels.

From my point of view as a full-time plant designer, this announcement, even if not much will be noticed in the short term, is the beginning of the end of modern process engineering plants in Russia. The consequences will be:

Lower production volumes with higher production costs

Poorer product quality

Loss of flexibility (responding to customer needs)

Increased risks, probably more accidents (especially if Schneider withdraws. 40% of the safety-related controls in the world are provided by their Triconex brand)

More plant incidents concerning
Environment

Plant safety

Occupational safety

EVERYTHING in the modern world is complicated. Losing one of the world's most important specialists in plant engineering is a long-term disaster for Russia. It may be the beginning of the end for Russia's process industry (chemical, oil and gas).

 >Simo Häyhä (Finnish: [ˈsimo ˈhæy̯hæ] (listen); 17 December 1905 –  1 April 2002), often referred to by his nickname, The White Death, was a Finnish military sniper in World War II during the 1939–1940 Winter War against the Soviet Union. He used a Finnish-produced M/28-30, a variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle. Häyhä had also used a submachine gun, the Suomi KP/-31. He is believed to have killed over 500 men during the Winter War, the highest number of sniper kills in any major war.

This is very illuminating. I think there might be something to my idea of preying on the Russian's need to show results, and hence making bad decisions. I was just spitballing that one but it's got legs, and dovetails quite well into this fundamental idea of making them pay over and over for the same territory. 

Systems break when there is no feedback of accountability: in a kleptocracy the incentive is to steal, look out for yourself and cover your ass. If you do what it says in the paperwork it's always someone else's fault. Problems move up the line until someone takes the fall and gets eliminated, to be replaced by someone less familiar with the problem to fix it. Eventually it goes to shit because no one is trying to solve the problem, only to stay out of it. 

So the battlefield commanders need to show results, and results are land taken, then they will order the soldiers to take the land, whether it makes sense to or not. Someone higher up decides whether it makes sense, and that person isn't connected to the facts in the specific situation, they just need to advance the war forward.

As a system it doesn't work, as there's no feedback to correct itself. That's the sort of things I think about in this war. This tactical information is very helpful, and I feel certain the Ukrainians are exploiting the systems theory as their information war is top-notch from what I've seen.

In reality many if not most people are terrible at critical thinking in general. It’s hard work to get it right, and requires a lot of diligence most people either cannot or will not give.  

But then again many people are doing the best they can and should be forgiven for not doing it perfectly. 

Reddit is kind of a terrible place to get news but with diligence it can be a great aggregator. And in that sense it’s better than every single other social media source out there. 

Epistemology is hard to get right. And no, the echo chamber does not help. In fact it hurts. But then again morale is also very real. 

This war is very complex and is many things good and bad simultaneously. So we are given the choice to decide what to say.

Part of the issue is that most people are technology illiterate. Technology has come so far that devices are designed to be intuitive to just pick up and use.

All of these cool features that make day to day life easy actually generate a LOT of a data footprint.

These footprints are becoming a MASSIVE tool in the intelligence world and have impacts on the ground.

If you get enough threads of data with timelines and known truths, all sorts of juicy things can be deduced.

Basically - if you are a soldier on the ground, turn off all your shit and you rotate within your section/unit who gets to use what, when, so the footprint is less.

And that’s why I consider Bush’s actions after September 11 to be one of the dumbest and reputation damaging periods in American foreign policy history.

America was attacked by a bunch of Saudi terrorists. Bush attacked Iraq. He accused Iraq of WMDs and it seems more than likely Cheney and Powell …just made it up.

Agree they just wanted to invade Iraq to get Saddam, mostly because the first invasion by Bush snr didn’t get the desired result.

As dumb as all that was (and you’ve got to wonder about some back room GOP oil motivations), I still contend that genocide was never the goal in Iraq.

It clearly is Russias goal in Ukraine.

Even worse, Bush invaded Afghanistan on the pretext he was hunting for Binladen. Who was finally found and killed in Pakistan by Obama.

In July 2016, Ray Mabus, then United States Secretary of the Navy, advised Congress that he intended to name the John Lewis-class oilers after prominent civil rights leaders, with this ship to be named in honor of gay rights activist Harvey Milk. The ship was officially named at a ceremony in San Francisco on 16 August 2016. She is the first US Navy ship named for an openly gay person.

Unless you think that news of civilians dying will change the west's economic calculus (why would it) or the western public's opinion on it (highly unlikely I think.) It's easy to say I'm wrong when you completely change the context of the discussion.

2. In the new context (economic decision of the west vs cost analysis by Ukraine), your argument here makes sense. If the west believes there is no point in pressing an offense on Russia, that will change their economic calculus in bankrolling the war. Of course, the west's goal may differ from Ukraine's; even without believing there is any hope, a ceasefire still benefits Russia (and, perhaps, the remainder of Ukraine, but not occupied/annexed Ukraine) more than anyone.

Anyway, do I personally think they can push Russia out of the East? I think the chance is non-zero. The chance of retaking Kherson is somewhat higher. The chance of retaking Crimea militarily is next-to-zero. And, I think political processes that result in that territory changing hands also have a non-zero chance. But the two of us discussing that is basically all guesswork, unless you're actually a hidden expert, neither of us know shit.

But, when you switch from talking about civilian casualties, to an economic decision, to making pretend-authoritative predictions that x y and z will all definitely fail, I can see why the other dude thought you might be arguing disingenuously. On the specific point I actually replied to or said anything about, whether whatever amount of civilian lives is worth not doing a ceasefire, do you have a counter that it matters what anyone but Ukraine thinks about that?

>all these things are intertwined dude

Yah, but I responded specifically to you asking some random dude on the internet whether he thinks 10k civilian deaths are worth it, with the implication (and you can correct me if I misread) that it definitely isn't and Ukraine will therefore definitely accept a ceasefire (as the guy you were responding was saying they would not.)

My response was that, if you want to argue that Ukraine would accept a ceasefire, you should be asking ""does Ukraine think 10k lives would be worth it"" and that, based on their current rhetoric, probably yes.

And as long as we're talking about civilian lives specifically, that's all that matters. How good they think their chances are, whether they care or will keep on fighting even if it's hopeless, all up to them. Can't say ""Ukraine will accept a ceasefire"" based on your answers to these questions, only based on Ukraine's.
