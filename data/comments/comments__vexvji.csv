Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 18 June 2022

- In the last 48 hours, Russia has likely renewed its efforts to advance south of Izium, with the goal of advancing deeper into the Donetsk Oblast, and to envelop the Sieverodonetsk Pocket from the north.

- Since 14 June, Russian and separatist officials have claimed they are attempting to establish humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to evacuate Sieverodonetsk. Russia has precedent, both earlier in the Ukraine campaign and in Syria, of using unilaterally-declared 'humanitarian' corridors as a mechanism to manipulate the battlespace and impose the forced transfer of populations.

- Ukrainian civilians trapped in Sieverodonetsk are likely to be suspicious of using the proposed corridor. Options to leave the town are limited by the destruction of bridges, but Russia's proposed route would take them towards the town of Svatova, deeper inside Russian-occupied territory. If trapped civilians don't take up the offer of exiting via a corridor, Russian will likely claim justification in making less of a distinction between them and any Ukrainian military targets in the area.

Day 115 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there were at least 2 missile strikes in the city, one at 1pm and another at their usual 11pm. They don’t fire their MLRS at Kharkiv as much as before, but missile strikes are now much more frequent. It’s so weird that they always launch their missiles at 11pm. It is nice that we know when to anticipate them, but it sucks not knowing where those missiles will land next time.

Just today at least 3 cities and their oblasts were hit with missiles; over 10 of them were fired, probably closer to 20, if not more. This is most likely in retaliation for our recent strikes on their munitions depots. Arestovych confirmed that in the past 3 days we destroyed at least 7 big ammo depots, many of those were caught on video, Russians really didn’t like that, and fired missiles at our cities.

And actually right now, at 5am, there are some explosions happening in the city, air raid alert activated as well just now, not sure what it is yet, it might be incoming shelling, but some of the explosions also could be from our own artillery firing back. From where I am, those explosions sound distant, so it’s hard to say what it is, but in some other districts they sound extremely close, and much more like incoming shelling.",False,1655605409.0,t3_vexvji,t3_vexvji,,0,73,0,73,0,0,

On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that prominent paramedic Yuliya Payevska, aka Tayra, had been freed from Russian captivity.

In a video posted on Telegram, he said: ""I can announce today that we managed to free from captivity Tayra - Ukrainian paramedic Yuliya Payevska. I am grateful to all who worked to achieve this result. Tayra is already home. We will go on working to bring everybody back.""

Payevska was captured by Russian forces together with her driver in Mariupol in mid-March, where she'd been working as a paramedic, helping to evacuate injured soldiers and civilians.

Her husband believes she was taken to Russia. A propaganda video featuring her was carried by some pro-Kremlin Russian TV channels.

News of her release was welcomed by many Ukrainian commentators:

The building was destroyed with 40 teams from Vorezh. In addition to them there was 200 representatives of the 533rd command and intelligence of the GRU general staff.

Russia's economy may take a decade to recover from the crushing sanctions placed on the country following its invasion of Ukraine, according to a top banking executive.

Returning to pre-sanctions levels could take nearly 10 years as the nation remains cut off from half of its trade, said German Gref, the boss of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank.

Mr Gref estimated the countries who have severed ties with Russia were responsible for 56% of its exports and 51% of its imports, crippling the economy.

""This is a threat to 15% of the country's gross domestic product, the bulk of the economy is under the fire,"" said chief executive Mr Gref, speaking at Russia's annual international economic forum in St Petersburg.

These are simply massive figures over time and not sustainable in the least. I don't think anyone is thinking that the war won't last for at least that long. I'm not saying even those figures will be enough to calm the bear, but it is a good trend nonetheless.

However, I suspect Ukraine is going to need increasingly more heavy NATO weapons to keep up with this pace.

NATO aid is a second interesting topic. There have been analyses at least by Hertling and Dailykos stating that the MLRS rockets in particular are a massive hurdle logistics wise. They will heavily tax the Ukrainian logistics network. The issue then is not about the amount of help the West can provide, but how much Ukraine can absorb of that help within any given time. Ukrainian logistics are now finally starting to be ready for the strain added by the MLRS supply. With the help of the US in particular, the supply chain should keep developing further as the war goes on.

Republican senators have asked TikTok's Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew about reports that the social media site had allowed Russian state-approved media content but barred other videos.

The senators wrote they were ""deeply concerned"" that TikTok ""is enabling the spread of pro-war propaganda to the Russian public, which risks adding to an already devastating human toll for both Ukrainians and Russians.""

The company is owned by Beijing-based internet technology company ByteDance and has been under mounting US scrutiny over the personal data it handles. 

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

TikTok said in a statement to Reuters new agency that the company was looking forward to continuing to engage with members on these issues and answer their questions.

In March the Chinese-owned video app said it would suspend live-streaming and the uploading of videos to its platform in Russia as it reviewed the implications of a new media law signed by Vladimir Putin.

The senators said TikTok has failed ""to equally enforce this policy"" and cited a news report that said it ""appears TikTok belatedly closed this loophole on March 25.""

*Not at all. Russia has paid dearly for what, half a city? They can’t make it into nor past the industrial half. Putin gave them until June 10th to take both Sievierodonetsk and Lyschansk, and claim the highway, yet here we are more than a week later and they haven’t accomplished any of it. Ukraine has also made it clear the bridges weren’t their only supply lines. They are not surrounded.*

*The counter offensive has meanwhile been extremely successful for Ukraine. First, it has exposed just how ineffective Russia’s BTG’s have become. Second, it has forced Putin to focus what’s left of its better troops on a non-strategic target for his weak little ego. This has allowed Ukraine to make strategic advances around both Izyum and Kherson. While Tiny-dick Putin is sacrificing his troops in Sievierodonetsk, Ukraine is creeping westward in both the north and the south.*",False,1655571430.0,t3_vexvji,t3_vexvji,,0,60,0,60,0,0,

>**Ukraine to resume negotiations in August**

>Ukraine's chief negotiator David Arachamija wants to resume negotiations with Moscow at the end of August after counterattacks are carried out. Then Ukraine will have a better negotiating position, he told the Voice of America broadcaster. Negotiations on a peace settlement had begun shortly after the Russian attack on Ukraine. At the end of March, during talks in Istanbul, Kiev had proposed, among other things, to renounce NATO membership in exchange for international security guarantees. Russia, however, is also demanding demilitarization and territorial cessions.

- International trade and immigration are generally good, with limited exceptions, and reduce war.

- All ethnic groups and all combinations of ethnic groups have equal abilities to form prosperous countries, even if some have been disadvantaged by historical or political factors.

- Xenophobia and racism are primarily a result either of unfamiliarity or propaganda, and will gradually fade away with integration (as has largely happened with gay communities)

- Environmental problems are largely a result of pollution, misallocation of resources, and dependency on fossil fuels rather than fundamental scarcities.

- The vast majority of countries can adopt the better aspects of Western liberal democracy.

- Capitalism can be regulated without collective action led by strong, cohesive nation-states.

- Principles work better than pure realpolitik (liberalism vs. power politics).

I don't plan on checking out anytime before the 2050s but I don't want to outlive these key principles, which seem to be on the rocks due to slowdowns in the developing world, resurgent racism, shortages of raw materials (even if a country wanted to build tons of housing to lower costs for newcomers, things like lumber and concrete are volatile in cost), and of course the reason I'm here: **this f!cking war.** The last time we didn't have these principles generally accepted, we saw the horrors of a racially-motivated war.",False,1655580804.0,t3_vexvji,t3_vexvji,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

I saw one of those Russian person on the street interviews a few day ago and one woman said that all those companies would come back once this was over because Russia was so big they need Russia’s business.  And, some guy blamed the USA (of course) for making all the business leave and the European businesses would return soon.

Except for a few companies that owned factories in Russia, their loss of Russian business will be a footnote on their balance sheet.  And, I don’t think many companies will return as long as the keep threatening to reclaim all of the former Soviet Union land.   The whole country seems to live in an alternate reality where Russia is important to the global economy and multi-national corporations.

The impact of the sanctions will continue to grow every day, and the government can only pretend they don’t matter for so long.

The impact of the loss of the foreign companies is enormous:

""*Academics at the Yale School of Management have found that revenue drawn from the (near) 1,000 companies curtailing or ending operations in Russia is equivalent to approximately 45% of Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP).""*

I'd say: These are the official reasons, but not the real ones. Russia already has gas and oil, and while there does seem to be some merit in at least denying Ukraine its own shot at extracting those, he was already denying it from them with the donbabwean republics. Likewise, Russia already has plenty of land (too much, in fact, and it's a drain on Russia to defend so much, but that's another topic). The potemkin republics never mattered to him as anything but a bargaining chip, an attempt at installing parasite states in Ukraine with which he could control it through the Minsk agreements (those fell through). So, I don't think these are the reasons. Putin and Russia always lies, it's a given that when he says ""it's about the people's republics"" it's just another lie. 

The real reason is this: Putin's Regime fundamentally can not survive a prosperous democratic Ukraine. The Russian people are kept in a state of torpor in which their dreary lives, suppressed underneath a murderous dictatorship, are kept barely livable with alcoholism, drug abuse and nationalism. That nationalism is predicated on this first and foremost pillar: That the Russians are best and everyone else is fit only to be its ""friends"" (read: slaves). Russia's self-worth relies on being able to point at their 'brother-folk' (read: the Ukrainians that they repeatedly starved to death by the thousands) and be able to say ""Well, we may not be feeling well, but least our little brothers have it worse, so maybe things aren't that bad after all!""

With Ukraine out of Russia's control and set on the path towards prosperity, the basis for the average Russian's self-worth will evaporate. Propaganda can only go so far, and many Russians have family in Ukraine that they speak with on a daily basis, so that knowledge will spread. The Russians live underneath Putin and his predecessors because they are afraid that things will get even worse if things change. Because in Russia, all change is bad change. But Ukraine is close to them, both culturally and personally. If Ukraine manages to drag itself out of the pit of corruption and mendacity that Russia tries to pull it into, the average Russian will not only lose the ability to feel superior to something, but may also just start thinking ""If even our little brother-folk can get better through rebellion... maybe we can achieve the same...""

tl;dr: Putin's Russia needs a poor, corrupt Ukraine in order to have someone it can feel superior to. If Ukraine leaves and becomes a rich democracy with western guidance, Russia will feel both embarrassed as well as motivated towards trying the same. Which can only be accomplished through violent rebellion against Putin. Keeping Ukraine poor is a matter of existentialism for Putin's Russia, so he will not just try to conquer it, he will also try to break it, if only so that the russian people can feel superior to the ash-pile.",False,1655581313.0,t3_vexvji,t1_icv2fia,,1,29,0,29,0,0,

1/ Yes. War is all about logistics. To put it simply, Ukraine seems to get it. The Kherson front is the right front to push because it’s supply lines are short and not in danger. Watch for MLRS smacking the Russians in the south.

Contrast that with Russia where their logistics are a mess. Imagine putting a major ammo dump within rocket range…. Dumb. Their logistical mistakes in the first month are now legendary.

2/ Leadership. This is why you don’t let politicians command an army. Russia’s military goals are politically motivated. Instead of looking at what is achievable and safe, operational decisions are being made for political and propaganda reasons. These are basic leadership errors. Severodonesk is a serious strategic error for Russia. It is a cauldron that negates all of Russia’s military advantages. Yet, as the politics is being prioritised over the military strategy, Russia is persisting with a bad idea that is tying up a disproportionate amount of its forces. All the while, they are also not defending their biggest city properly. Kherson. The Russian leadership is not paying attention to the reality on the ground.

3/ Attrition. Your point is the crux of the issue. Russia has this narrative that they are willing to sacrifice people on the front for gains. This is fine if what you are losing is replaceable. Russia can’t replace their tanks, planes and elite forces. In the context of this war, these losses are permanent. As for the troop losses, I suspect these are more critical than Russia realise. General mobilisation hasn’t happened. Probably because they can’t. Younger Russians aren’t willing to die on mass in a losing war.

Russia has already lost this war.

I also agree with your sentiment regarding America. At times America can be brutal in business, this is not the same as wanting to invade you, kill your children, rape you wife, and take your land.

They should be able to ford the river back with their men so they aren't trapped too. 

I remember way back before the battle for this city started the big concerns was that everything was going to get encircled from Popasna and Ukraine was making a bad moving staying to defend because of that. But to my knowledge it's been going really good for Ukraine compared to those estimates. No encirclements and lots of actual contact engagements with Russian troops desperately trying to take it.

Not saying it's perfect. The artillery is hurting Ukraine a lot in the Donbas but I don't think that's related to the city so not like pulling back would make that better.

[A comparison between a Tomahawk Missile and a russian Kalibr Missile](https://imgur.com/a/ANtbRgQ)

... at the beginning of the war, Russia had a national stockpile of 5,976 missiles of varying types at the beginning of the invasion, with no precise details known. We know that by May 17, they have fired a total of 2,154 missiles. Now, one month later, if they have kept firing at the same rate, they have fired around 2865 missiles at Ukraine. Meaning they passed almost half of their national stockpile of missiles. These days, there are no volleys of long-range cruise missiles anymore, with zero Iskanders, their most famous and feared missiles. Kalibrs were the next in line to run out. So, to supplement their Kalibrs, it looks like they are dusting off even older stuff now, which has even worse precision.

This isn't terror. At least not quite purposeful terror. This is a shitton of degraded, ancient cruise missiles dragged from whatever run-down storage they could reach. Consequently, their accuracy has become even worse and they are just flying all over the place. The resulting ordnance is still pretty deadly to civilians though. Which may just be a feature to the Russians.

EDIT: Note that just because Russia had 5,976 missiles in their national stockpile, it doesn't mean they actually want to shoot all of them at Ukraine. Always afraid of being invaded by someone, be it NATO, China or an opportunistic neighbor, Russia will likely never go lower than a third of its stockpile in order to keep at least a number for preventive defence purposes. So, they may have fired 2865 out of almost 6000 so far, but it's likely they won't want to shoot more than 4000. Meaning that Ukraine has about 1000 left to absorb. Not good but at least the older missiles should be easier to shoot down and their impact on the war as a whole has likely pretty much evaporated. They will still kill many civilians though.",1655582607.0,1655578195.0,t3_vexvji,t1_icus3dv,,2,21,0,21,0,0,

Also, a few points:  
1.	The gas turbine engine requires less maintenance than a diesel. Gas turbines only have one rotating assembly, which is inherently more reliable than a reciprocating engine due to mechanical stresses only working in a constant direction. One of the major reasons the Army has stayed with the AGT-1500 was that no other engine they looked at could go 500 hours without a major overhaul.  
2.	Operator and unit level maintenance on the AGG-1500 is fairly simply, since if there is a serious problem, you rip out the entire powerpack (engine and transmission) and sent it back for repairs at Anniston Army Depot in Alabama. The entire assembly can be replaced in 30 minutes with a skilled crew, because it’s all bolts and quick-disconnect lines.  
3.	The fuel consumption problem is overblown.  There is no “fuel efficient tank”. The Abrams is more efficient than most tanks (and all tanks it’s age) while it’s on the move due the higher thermal efficiency of gas turbines. The problem has always been it’s fuel consumption at idle, which was solved with a small auxiliary power unit.",1655579278.0,1655573659.0,t3_vexvji,t1_icujrzm,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

There are bunches of Leopards in storage and realistically, there just aren't enough modern Leopards period to fulfill Ukraine's needs and Germany's production capacity to make new ones is pretty thin.

There are other, more modern, tanks than the Abrams, like the 4th generation Korean K2, but there are only 260 in service and production capacity is ~100 a year, and the SK army needs all they can get to modernize their forces. It'd probably be the best tank, but again, there just aren't enough.

So what tanks are plentiful enough to meet Ukraine's needs in a realistic time frame? The soviet/russian T-series and the Abrams. And the Russian tanks aren't viable option for a lot of reasons.

Overall the study looks pretty solid (at the first glance) but leaves me with a few questions. For example what it counts as ""committed."" The 40 Leopard 2A4 from Spain seem to be included in this numbers and I find that a bit questionable far a ""proposal"" that is in such an early state and not even really checked for feasibility.

A country, that makes a lot of promises looks good in the ""committed"" part. (And bad in comparison, if it don't delivers fast.) Do simple claims from media outlets count too? Or requests from weapons manufacturers? Or only, what the government itself promised?

A country that plans to send heavy and/or complex weapon systems, that take more time for preparations, looks bad in the ""delivered"" part.

As you wrote. Deliveries and commitments that are only possible because other countries agreed to replace the weapons with others (like the T-72s from Poland or the BMP-1s from Greece) are counted only for the nation that delivers or commits directly to Ukraine.

Training of crews seems also to count for nothing, but that is really hard to  express in money.

But also, how is the value of the weapons calculated? How much is a more or less old but upgraded T-72 or old and stock BMP-1 worth? How much a modern anti-tank-weapon that requires little/no training and preparation and can be delivered fast?

I think, the whole story is way to complicated to be explained in one oder a handful of simple graphs. That's more for history books years later, when all information is there and verifiable.",1655583099.0,1655582796.0,t3_vexvji,t1_icv0m7l,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Of course not.

Every murderous dictatorship looks shiny and beautiful on the outside. Scratch the surface a bit and things become pretty clear fast. The Second Chechen War was started in 1999 and ended in 2000 with amassed artillery strikes devastating and depopulating Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. Russia killed so many Chechen civilians there that Grozny's population hasn't recovered to this very day. How did the Second Chechen War start? With the recently elected Putin using the FSB to false flag bombings on his own people. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War#Bombings_in_Russia
>Before the wake of the Dagestani invasion had settled, a series of bombings took place in Russia (in Moscow and in Volgodonsk) and in the Dagestani town of Buynaksk. On 4 September 1999, 62 people died in an apartment building housing members of families of Russian soldiers. Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total over 350 people were killed. A criminal investigation of the bombings was completed in 2002. The results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif (both of whom were later killed), in retaliation for the Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan. Six other suspects have been convicted by Russian courts. **However, Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agents were caught by local police for planting one of the bombs, but were later released on orders from Moscow.**[54] Many observers, including State Duma deputies Yuri Shchekochikhin, Sergei Kovalev and Sergei Yushenkov, cast doubts on the official version and sought an independent investigation. Some others, including David Satter, Yury Felshtinsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Alexander Litvinenko, as well as the secessionist Chechen authorities, claimed that the 1999 bombings were a false flag attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya, which boosted the popularity of Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin, brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma in the 1999 parliamentary election, and secured Putin as president within a few months. The book describing the bombings as FSB false flag operations are described in the book Blowing Up Russia, which is banned in the Russian Federation.

Already in 1999, Putin was killing Russians just so that he could use them to kill Chechens and 'make right the humiliation that was Russia's defeat in the First Chechen War'. Today, Russia features THE highest production of Child Pornography, corruption on par with the most loathsome places in Africa, AIDS-rates that, too, are on the same level as Third World nations and a legalization of domestic rape and abuse that makes 49% of all russian women feel unsafe in their own four walls when their husband is home. It was legalized on recommendation of Putin's religious advisor, a devout orthodox Christian who describes the beating of women as ""good for the feminine soul.""",1655588278.0,1655587723.0,t3_vexvji,t1_icvd3sl,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

*A $40 billion spending package passed by Congress last month aims to replenish these stockpiles. But the problem goes deeper than short-term supply disruptions.* ***Military planners and defense contractors have long prioritized spending on big-ticket “platforms,” such as aircraft carriers and fighter jets, over making weapons themselves. Pandemic-related disruptions in the supply chain for microchips have made the problem worse.*** *And the erosion of the military’s industrial base has made it harder for the Pentagon to accelerate production. Defense-industry concentration, cumbersome contracting rules, and a shortage of skilled workers have slashed the number of companies in the business. A 2020 Pentagon report found that in an alarming number of cases, the military relies on a single, “often fragile” supplier to make critical components.*

*The weakness of the Pentagon’s supply chain threatens not only aid to Ukraine but also America’s ability to respond to future crises — including a potential conflict over Taiwan, whose military depends on US-made hardware. To address the current strain, President Joe Biden should consider invoking the Defense Production Act, which requires manufacturers to prioritize delivering goods for defense-related needs over orders from other industries. Although sometimes misused for political purposes, the authority could in this case help to ease production bottlenecks for military vehicles and heavy weaponry.*

For some of us the *insane* beliefs a lot of westerners had about Russian anti-air missile systems capabilities were suspected to be way overblown and reminiscient of German belief in ""wunderwaffen"" in 1943-44. It just did not rhyme with Russian technological prowess in other fields that their systems should be that good, and we got steady hints from various sources they were not, for example through some Israeli operations against Syrian operated systems.

We also knew the Russian arms development was a complete wasteland for the better part of 15 years during the 90's and early noughts.

But we didnt realize just how seriously corruption had raided their weapon storages, just how deeply unfit their tanks and tank protection systems were against even aging russian models not to mention modern western ATGMs. And finally we thought the Russians had realized they spent all their sympathy resources among the Ukrainian population in 2014 and the 8 years following. So noone knew the Russian high command and Putin himself was completely oblivious to the state of their own armed forces and just how *hated* they are in Ukraine.

To state it simply; If Russia somehow got divine intervention and managed to beat the Ukrainian armed forces to a point of occupying all of Ukraine, it would lead to the greatest campaign of backalley throat slitting ever witnessed from the day of Ukraines defeat until the day Russian troops gave them their country back by running screaming back across the border.

False.  Here's the text:  https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557/BillText/Filed/PDF

Important points:

1. No problem mentioning sex or sexual attraction to elementary kids per the text.  But there is a problem mentioning sexual orientation.  E.g. addressing the issue when a parent has two dads and kids are curious.
2. Permits parents to sue for DJ based on *their own interpretation of what is appropriate*.  This effectively gives individual parents veto rights over curriculum, because they can impose lots of costs on a district if the district doesn't agree, *even if the district ultimately prevails in court*.  Worse, the legislation provides for the recovery of court costs and attorney's fees if the parents have *any success* in the litigation, even a small win on a subsidiary point.
3. Prohibits schools teaching students of any age from keeping information confidential for minors.  So, if you have a 17 year old student, who says ""I think I may be gay, but don't tell my parents because they'll throw me out of the house""-- guess what, you have to tell the parents unless you can prove the parents will cause direct physical harm to the child.",1655593834.0,1655593493.0,t3_vexvji,t1_icvpu56,,1,2,0,2,0,0,
