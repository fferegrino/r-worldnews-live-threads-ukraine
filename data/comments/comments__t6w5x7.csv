c51014ebc84ac587e0f52d5010f13179,t6w5x7,hzdyby8,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has critisized Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”.

“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional nighttime address.

Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, said. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.”

Zelenskiy said Nato countries have created a narrative that a no-fly zone would provoke Russia’s aggression against NATO. “This is the self-hypnosis of those who are weak, insecure inside, despite the fact they possess weapons many times stronger than we have,” he said.

He also praised Ukrainians for their resistance against Russia’s invasion: “We are warriors of light,” he said. “The history of Europe will remember this forever.”

Officers seized a 213ft (65 metre) yacht worth $27m (£20m) owned by Alexey Mordashov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and Russia's richest man, in the northern port of Imperia, officials told local media. Another yacht, owned by Gennady Timchenko, another oligarch with close ties to Putin, has been impounded in Imperia, officials said. Mordashov is worth an estimated $29bn and built his wealth around the Russian steel producer Severstal, while Timchenko is said to hold around $17bn of assets and made his fortune in oil trading.

But the minute the market opens, it does not matter whether the war is over and if they've taken Ukraine. The fire sales waiting to happen once the market is back open, the mass cash pullouts at every bank, half the Russian market cut off from the global economy.

You don't recover from this. You don't turn it around in day, week, month, or even year. This is great depression levels of nuking an economy.

Trading with China won't fix it either. China will charge them more for being a middleman, can't provide them with everything they needed, and will hold an enormous amount of economic power over them akin to China and North Korea.

If China shuns them it's even worse. If you want a good example of how bad it can get when a country is closed off like this, look at post Revolutionary War US when Britain and France refused to trade with us. Keeping in mind our ability to self sustain was better than Russia's.

If you think Putin dieing will make it better, guess again. Power vacuums rarely pave way for Democracy and progress. He will be replaced most likely by someone who has the support of the military and is willing to be violent to gain control.

The country will become more closed off with the only real relations being related to oil, if that. In instances like this, nations trading with a violent one look for alternate sources. Then when the violence resolves the violent nation has lost the majority of that income.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60532634

It’s day nine of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here's a quick recap of the main developments over the past 24 hours:

* After meeting foreign ministers in Brussels, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had made the ""painful decision"" to rule out calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine
* A furious Ukrainian President Zelensky responded in a statement: “Today the leadership of the [Nato] alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages""
* Russia has banned Facebook and blocked access to Twitter and YouTube. Moscow says it retaliated after access to several Russian media accounts was restricted on Facebook
* President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill that punishes the spread of ""fake"" information about Russia's armed forces with jail sentences of up to 15 years
* Heavy fighting has continued in Ukraine's north, east and south
* Kyiv has faced new Russian missile strikes, with explosions heard around the capital, while the south-eastern port city of Mariupol has been surrounded and shelled, and the bombardment continues in the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv
* ""The world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe,"" the US says, referring to a Russian attack on Thursday night on Europe's largest nuclear facility, the Zaporizhzhya plant, in Ukraine
* International monitors say no radioactive material was released and the plant is safe
* Thousands of Ukrainian refugees continue their exodus from the wartorn country",False,1646437335.0,t3_t6w5x7,t3_t6w5x7,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

Read everything before taking action. 

The **resistance** in Russia needs help from people OUTSIDE Russia - if they themselves post anything on social media about the war they can now get 3 years in prison! There is a cry for help by well informed, especially young Russians who want to protest the war to spread information of when protests are taking place! **To protest most safely they depend on the safety of numbers!** 

This is a very real and alive resistance movement boiling underneath the Russian state and state controlled propaganda. Earlier this week, the already imprisoned opposition leader, Alexey Navalny has called for protests on Twitter where he addressed the Russian people - and he was specific about time. The places below are the  main squares for protets he also suggested. 

THE MAIN PROTEST IS ON SUNDAY AT 14:00 (2 PM). Time is now of the essence!

IMPORTANT:
You need to use creative ways to get through to Russians as Facebook, Twitter and many other websites have now been suspended. 

- Use Russian groups on Telegram, underground groups in Russia are also known to use these. 
- Use sites like TripAdvisor.ru and pick random places in cities you can find on Google Maps and spread information via reviews. 
- You can use Instagram and WhatsApp as these are still not banned in Russia, but the message needs to reach Russians in Russian. 
- If you are aware of other sites still **that allow posting** in Russia please suggest these - Google translate can be used to translate an entire Russian site into English. 

English translation of message:

Protest the war! Saturday at 14:00. Do not let fear be greater than your conscience. Save lives and our future. Spread the word!

tl;dr

Xi is playing the long game to make Russia a Chinese Puppet state, 100% relying on China to maintain its existence in anywhere close to its current form of government.

On the other hand, Xi massively underestimated EU+US/NATO involvement and the upping of NATO military budgets + the drastic affects of sanctions and how far they have been going.

It's likely made Taiwan untouchable for China, but China receives a massive consolation prize of Russia as its puppet state.

For those hoping for Putin to endure a public miscalculation, and a significant damage to his political capital, there's hope. For those looking for a victory of some sort for Ukraine? In name only. The victory will be over the rubble of their own cities, and what's the end result? Russia with more territory, and the same political reality, where the west isn't willing to defend ukraine against Russian threat.

 Ukraine remains a convenient buffer for a proxy war, but how life looks good after the seige of all their significant cities, I do not know, even if they have political continuity after this conflict. Sectarianism is a likely result. Regions may be more pragmatic with Russia on their doorstep, in full knowledge that in Europe and the us, they have arms suppliers, but not co combatants.

I guess that's why I cry every time my country tests its air raid sirens (two wednesdays a year, at noon). For the same reason I hate ""Cold Response"". I hate tens of thousands of Nato soldiers exercising in my neighbourhood. Again. I couldn't hate it more. I couldn't hate the fact that it is necessary any more. I don't want my country's PM to be the head of Nato.

I'm aware what MAD means. Both for me amd my famly, as well as for the whole world. 


I  think that Putin would rather be remembered as the leader who tried and failed, than the leader who failed ultimately and killed mother Russia.  

I'm equally sure that Putin is insane, as I am that he is not stupid.  He  wants a ""united Russia"",  but he doesn't want a dead Russia. He doesn't want billions of deaths. ""A world with Russia or no world"" is one part of his western-orientated propaganda that I'm not buying. I highly  doubt that all the people involved necessary to make ""no world"" happen are buying it either.


A part of Putins propaganda that I do believe in (despite all the fucking lies) is when he indicates that he wants Poland too. And a part of the baltics. And Moldova. Or whatever used to be ""Russia"" at some point in time. 

I'm quite sure that if nato secured a nfz or got involved even deeper, we could see tactical nukes being used, but not strategical ones. And at some point ""quite sure"" has to be enough. Nobody is  ever going to ""know"".

Does ""not knowing"" mean Putin can do whatever he wants? Would it be enough if Putin took another non-Nato country? If he used tactical nukes in Ukraine? If he (theoretically, because 'why would he?') started a proper Genocide? If he attacked a member of Nato?  How far do we have to let him go because ""but if nukes""? 

If we are prepared to stop him at some point, why not stop him now? When is enough enough? 

I agree with Stoltenberg: Ukraine fighting alone means less civilian deaths than if nato would get involved. D'oh.
I fear that letting Putin ""succeed"" and ""win"" this war will serve as an example for both him, other nations with nuclear capabilities and history as a whole. I'm sure that it would lead to more and bigger conventional wars and more dead people in the long run.

What is our goal? As few dead people now as possible, or as few dead people as possible in the long run? If we want as few dead people as possible now, why don't we want Ukraine to just give up? If we're afraid  of provoking Putin, why do we destroy his country with these hilariously harsh sanctions? What is our endgame, really? 

MAD has affected some wars, but not others. MAD has never been used to try and force a complete change of geopolitics.  Putin tries to do that right now. He wants to stop and revert the evolution of the world. Why? Because he's afraid of a ghost. In reality, if Putin cooperated instead of being ""afraid"", everybody would win. Russia could prosper and really become a useful member of humanity. Maybe risking MAD is a risk worth taking, in order to stop him from keeping that destructive fear alive. 

I don't think I prefer my children living in a world run by Putin over risking everything in order to try and prevent  that. I really don't like the new ""15 years In prison for lying (aka: telling the truth) about our freedom Ooeration"" law. 

Why not just give up immediately if we think he's irrational and it's too dangerous to challenge him?

Article 5 isn't a ""must act"" article, just as much as non-membership isn't a ""must not act"".



Here's the kicker:

I'm not saying nato should get involved. I'm saying that you have to stop pretending as if the answer is so obvious. That as if everybody who even thinks that there might be a possibility of there being more than one way to deal with this situation is stupid. Call me insane and stupid, then call me insane and stupid again, then disagree with everything I said, then call me insane and stupid again. But think for a second before you parrot ""bUt NuKeS"" the next time. If that's your killer argument, maybe you haven't thought about it long enough. Or maybe you just don't really care about all of it, as long as you're safe. Fair enough. But then please stop celebrating Zelenskyj and waving the ukrainian flag.",1646445413.0,1646443019.0,t3_t6w5x7,t3_t6w5x7,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

We get it, it's appeasement, and it probably reminds you a lot of what has happened in Europe in the past. There's only one difference, the god damn nukes.

So long as there's no direct conflict between Russia and NATO there isn't going to be a nuclear war and NATO will do whatever it takes to make sure that doesn't happen. Yes, this means countries like Moldova and Georgia might be at risk for Russian invasion (Finland is protected as an EU member). Hell, it may even mean Putin might push it and test his ability to use tactical nukes in Ukraine itself. But as long as it's not NATO, NATO will not reply in kind. Sucks, but that's the reality.

We can hope that the few people who are around Putin recognize that while Russia can recover internationally from a conventional war, it will become a pariah state like North Korea if they did ever use nukes in Ukraine.

Give Russia 7 days to get the fuck out of Ukraine.  Be very clear that we will not be moving into Russia in any way, shape or form, but any Russian combatant in Ukraine after that 7-day deadline will be removed by *any* means necessary.

In those 7 days, do 2 things;

1) Accept Ukraine into NATO

2) Place every god damn NATO weapon just outside the western border of Ukraine.  

When 7 days are up, establish a no-fly zone and start moving all those weapons in (to the Ukriane), and don't stop until you hit the Russian border.

From Reuters:

Data showing a vibrant U.S. jobs market strengthened the dollar and spurred commodity prices higher, but the war in Ukraine overshadowed the blowout report as the euro plunged on the worsening outlook for slower European economic growth.

The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth surged in February, a bright spot for an economy that faces mounting headwinds from rising inflation, tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions.

The euro tumbled below $1.10 for the first time in almost two years and hit a fresh seven-year low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and fighting raged elsewhere in Ukraine.

European stocks sank to near one-year lows, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index sliding 3.56% to increase losses for the week to 7% - its worst weekly decline since the depths of a pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020.

But I have to say I’m worried that Zelenskyy is now being viewed as a god who can do no wrong now, people must remember that he is still a politician and whilst he is doing an amazing job he should not be immune from criticism, especially about his comments about NATO.

I get that he is doing everything he can for his people and that he doesn’t care if WWIII starts because he and his country are living it right now. 

But I don’t think it is doing Ukraine any good by attacking NATO for not doing exactly as he asks. He is sewing division in the west where there was unity just a week ago. He can lobby all he wants to world leaders but playing this out in the public eye is not going to go well for him as people in the West are disagreeing in the outcome which could lead to some severe fracturing.

It seems like everybody is in virtual agreement that this is a good thing. I said it before but I will say it again. 

Russia produces a huge amount oil&gas. Oil&gas prices have already skyrocketed this past year. If the west sanctions Russian energy it means lower global supply which means higher prices when prices have already skyrocketed! Like does anybody understand basic supply and demand before cheering on this kind of nonsense? 

Now I’m sure the middle class that overwhelmingly makes up the demographics of Reddit can handle another increase in fuel prices, but you know who can’t? Those in poverty and the working poor who can barely make ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck. This is the law of marginal utility of income. And because fuel is so incredibly demand inelastic any sanctions on Russian energy will hurt the poor the most by far. 

Now maybe for some of the people reading this they believe that the poor are just lazy and stupid and that anybody who works hard enough can just pull themselves up by the bootstraps. But I believe in economic justice. Now please tell me how it’s justice to ask the poorest of our nations to pay more money they don’t have for a people that are not their own?

Theres a few things going on if you read between the lines -

Pakistan PM has already met with Putin.

The sanctions are extremely heavy from the west so far, need to strangle Russia immediately as part of a long term strategy of full european war.

Finland, Sweden, Georgia want to be part of NATO ASAP

Chinese censorship of the paralympic presidents speech, and the censorship of the premiership football this weekend.

Finally, Putins age.. I dont believe for one second hes going to decimate Russias economy before he snuffs it.  He wants the world back for Russia",1646442161.0,1646442075.0,t3_t6w5x7,t3_t6w5x7,,0,-31,0,-31,0,0,

It is legally territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina but they feel like they are actually part of Serbia. They have their president and everything. He is called Dodik. And of course Putin and Russia support this very much. This is also why Serbian president is kissing Putins ass.

* A populist uprising with mass protests in St.Petersburg and Moscow

It allows the Russian ground based air defence (GBAD) system to recognise which aircraft are friendly and which aren’t.

So they only shoot down the enemy ones.

By having the IFF codes you can spoof the Russian GBAD into thinking your (Ukrainian) aircraft is a friendly (Russian) aircraft.

Alternatively if you mess with the IFF system itself it means that the GBAD can’t distinguish and therefore can’t be used at the same time and place as friendly (Russian) aircraft because you risk shooting down your own jets. As happened to the Americans in Iraq during gulf war II. [Link](https://www.theregister.com/2004/05/20/patriot_missile/)

It goes some way to explaining some of the strange Russian tactics, like not having the air defences active at all times, and limited use of air power.

In a scenario like this, the first person to pull the trigger (or in this case, launch a missile) is probably going to win. If one plane is sending out a mock-IFF signal, they can get the jump on their enemy (because they won't recognize the danger until they're fired upon), increasing the probability that they win the engagement.

Looking at this objectively this looks really bad for both sides right now. But arguably worse for Ukraine.

Sure they have done far, far better than even the most optimistic expert would have predicted but we are not even 10 days in and they have multiple cities close to encircled, under heavy siege (turned into rubble in the process) or already fallen (Kherson). The Russians despite all their losses and troubles also have advanced quite far into Ukraine.

I would agree that it will get harder and harder for both sides going forward and that Russia ultimately might be forced to halt their advances or even retreat due to a lack of logistics and supplies.

Only one person can save Russia from the worst consequences of the shattering international sanctions imposed on it in the past week. It’s not Vladimir Putin. The fate of Russia’s economy and Putin’s regime is now in the hands of the man he describes as his “best friend”.  
  
China’s President Xi Jinping alone has the power to keep the Russian economy functional and Putin in power. The Moscow share and derivatives market remains shut because the authorities know what would be revealed if it allowed them to open. How?  
  
Because the securities of 27 of Russia’s biggest companies continued trading in London for a few days until they were suspended this week. And the losses were horrendous. Before suspension, they’d lost between 90 and 100 per cent of their value since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. The sanction-hit Sberbank was down by 99.7 per cent to trade for just one penny, for instance. Oil giant Lukoil had lost 99.2 per cent.  
Russian government bonds have been downgraded to junk status. The rouble has fallen further in the past week than it did during the country’s 1998 default. In other words, world financial markets consider Russia to be all but bankrupt.  
The crafty Putin spent years anticipating Western sanctions on Russian banks by building a substantial foreign exchange warchest of $US630 billion in the central bank to keep the country solvent. He didn’t expect the West would hit his central bank as well as the commercial banks. Most of those reserves are now unavailable to Russia.

Will the EU nations increase military spending to such a degree that they can project power across thousands of miles? Only the US has shown they can do that and they account for 75% of NATO spending. I somehow doubt it. Even if they could, are they really interested in getting their hands dirty in east asia? We couldn't even figure out how to conquer the middle east.

Moving to Taiwan, you don't have a big cultural, linguistic or social divide between the two nations; the difference is almost purely political and artificial. It's difficult to break the chinese cultural bonds between them because they are very strong, even stronger than those between Ukraine and Russia. China doesn't need to do anything and with time, taiwan will get closer and closer to china culturally.

Even though the Ukraine crisis brought russia and china closer, i don't think it will ever be a true peer partnership.

If russia would attack latvia, article 5 would be activated. All NATO states would be at war with russia. The forward presence troops would engage with russian troops, trying to defend the baltics, while slowly retreating, bringing as much casualties to the russians as they can.

The movement would take the initiative from the russians and would buy time. As the Enhanced Forward Presence NATO troops are mostly reinforced Mechanized Battalion, russian troops would suffer severly.

NATO sends reinforcements and opens new theaters of war to support the war effort in the baltics. At this point, we switch into...

**Phase 2: Counteroffensive**

The NATO troops start to engage russian troops offensively. Russians have to retreat, dig in or risk getting destroyed. The numbers of casualties start to rise on both side, with a big spike difference towards russian casualties, as NATO hits more precisely.

The mission objective is to reconquer lost territory from the russians.

**Phase 3: Diplomacy and war**

NATO tries to end the war after pushing the russians out of territory - should the Kreml react. If not, the real war starts, NATO troops start to attack russian core territoy. This is the point where russia is guaranted to throw nukes on NATO troops, as their war strategies and politics demand, that no russian territory is to be conquered.

**Phase 4: nuclear retaliation**

In the final Phase, NATO reacts to the use of nukes in vengance with the use of their own nukes. The nuclear holocaust starts. The next 30 minutes are the last on earth for any human being alive. The armageddon destroys every metropolis in Europe, Asia and America. Deathtoll to rise into the billions. The bastards that survive this all-out mass-suicide die by the fallout und nuclear Winter, setting in afterwards. After 10.000 years on Earth, the human race finally ends itself and most of the life on earth.

The U.S. could have refused to elucidate its security commitments to Ukraine, much as it has done vis-à-vis Taiwan for decades. The implicit threat of U.S. and NATO intervention would have forced Putin to contend with the risks of further escalation. Instead, Biden granted Putin a free hand.

Certainly A. Vindman's voice is one of authority on UKR and RUS.  But I feel this misses an important point while making a dangerous and dubious assumption.  The assumption is that if American hadn't said one way or another if they would send troops or forces to UKR that it would have been sufficient to persuade Putin against the invasion.  There is zero evidence for that.  In fact, quite the opposite.  It is clear Putin's plan was that Ukraine would basically capitulate to Russian rule within hours and offer no resistance.  This was never supposed to be a war at all.  Get in, kill the president Z, install your lackey, get out.  The 'Special operation' was supposed to be done and over before anyone could have reacted, US or otherwise.

Secondly, the world wide response of drastic sanctions is only effective if everyone participates, and for that the actions of Putin has to be as egregious as possible.  Putin's main excuse for meddling with UKR is that the west and NATO is a direct threat to RUS.  By declaring that the USA had no intention of entering UKR, Biden robs Putin of that talking point.  When Putin invades anyway, it makes it clear there is no reasoning with Putin of justification of any kind, and the world responds in a united economic front.",False,1646439508.0,t3_t6w5x7,t1_hzdwr6u,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

A) That was recorded on a frequency in the 80 meter amateur band (3500 kHz to 3800 kHz in Russia, varies slightly by country, North America is 3500 kHz to 4000 kHz).

If you think Russia has no satellite comms and no method of encryption or scrambling, you're an idiot.

B) The ""coded language"" they claim was used, i.e. ""go to the place we were yesterday"" is likely referring to a frequency, not a place, and is mistranslated. Probably just amateur radio ops just trying to move to another band/frequency where they might get away from the jammers.

Actually the sanctions will make them weaker militarily.

As an immediate example, the manufacturer of the rockets used by Russia's MLRS system used to get its raw materials from firms in Finland and Germany. Right now the factory is scrambling to find other sources of those raw materials in Russia itself.

In the longer term, the complete collapse of the Russian economy is going to force them to reduce their spending on the military. This can take one of two forms depending on what happens and how long.

 * Form 1: They give up the ghost that they have a vast military (ex: their 30,000 tanks) and cut down the fake numbers to get to the point where they actually have maintained vehicles. With the economic downturn, this will almost certainly result in a smaller actually effective fighting force than they can muster even now.

 * Form 2: They stop all the expensive new R&D they've been engaged in. Russia's top-tier tanks/planes/etc are actually fairly capable items, but they just can't afford to produce them in any concerning numbers. In short, they'll get more bang for their buck if they just stop working on bleeding-edge gear and focus on producing what they can actually afford to make.

In the case of Form 1, you'll have relatively immediate effects (visible over a year or so) where they reorganize their own military industrial complex in order to appropriately size/scale their military to what they can actually afford. While general sanctions against Russia will almost certainly end not too long after the cessation of hostilities, I'd be VERY surprised if sanctions against the ability of international firms to do deals with Russian MIC firms were stopped.

In the case of Form 2, this is something that will more play out on the scale of decades because it basically ends up meaning that Russia's conventional military will slip further and further into technological obsolescence. We're already seeing how the bulk of the equipment they DO have fares against modern anti-tank/aircraft weaponry, and for the most part this is just the hand-held stuff rather than the big-dick equipment like Patriot missile launchers and such. As such, Western/NATO nations will be able to effectively just ignore the capabilities of Russia's conventional forces.",False,1646438858.0,t3_t6w5x7,t1_hzdv94h,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

They prefer ""Moldova"", Moldavia is the Russian nomenclature. But, in this case nothing. If they win Ukraine most people, including the Moldovans, expect them to take it. Good news it will likely be bloodless. I know a few Moldovans and said there is no will to fight there. Having a standing army of 6,000 might have something to do with that.

They already have access to the black sea, considering they had Crimea already. And no, having to occupy a country of 44 million extremely fanatical, hostile and armed people that are being supplied modern weaponry by NATO is _not_ the perfect starting point for further invasions.

4) Sweden is harder to reach for Russia since there is no land boarder (unless Finland is taken.) They would have to go to Sweden by sea, which includes funneling transport ships into the relatively thin canals in the Swedish archipelago. Sweden has a pretty good military industry, with it's own fighter planes and more importantly incredibly successful in stealth submarine technology.

Certainly Zelenskyy is well within his moral rights to ask for other countries to get involved in the conflict. And other countries are allowed to say no to that request.

It is effectively a slightly more complex trolley problem - not everyone is a consequentialist (which means their evaluations are shit but...) and you can't blame the one guy for being upset you might sacrifice him to save ones on the other track.

Since the nuclear option simply *is not guaranteed*, perfectly rational, intelligent people might come to a different conclusion than you.

That we will have to wait and see. Honestly this is why I'm kind of OK with Zelensky condemning NATO for not establishing a no-fly zone, especially when there is real popular support in NATO to do so. It shows Putin that NATO is leaving a more aggressive option off the table, and by comparison makes the arms shipments look milder. 

But generally speaking, if Putin does decide that, the normal way of handling that is to explicitly tell NATO. Like: ""Hey, starting date X I will consider any weapons shipment an act of war and will respond appropriately"", rather than immediately striking. Putin is not looking to get into a direct war with NATO either, but he might feel pressured to ""roll the iron dice"" and bet that he could bluff NATO one more time and thereby save his own position.

But even then, it seems like the damage is done. Large amounts of weapons have already entered Ukraine. Additionally, the supplies are generally of a small caliber and can be moved in civilian trucks rather than military transports. And with so many having entered already, NATO always retains plausible deniability. So what would just happen is that NATO would shift to covert operations rather than overt, and Russia would have a very hard time with it.

1. Some people may believe Putin won't order a nuclear strike if they do, or that his people will refuse the order if he does. Putin has to know that if he launches nukes at Western powers, they will almost certainly fire back with equivalent force. These people believe the Russian side to be rational enough not to sacrifice all of Russia and most of the world over a war, especially if the West sticks to fighting in Ukraine and makes it clear they have no intention of invading Russia.
2. They believe Putin will continue to escalate even if the West simply lets him get his way. He'll continue to push, and push, until eventually the West is forced to respond and see if he really will escalate it to nukes. That refusing to get involved is simply sacrificing Ukrainians for time and won't actually stop conflict between the West and Russia from happening.
3. They simply believe it's never right to abandon people to tyrants. If Putin starts nuclear war, the blame is on him, but not helping when we could is on us. That we need to stand up for what we believe is right no matter the cost.

Now, I certainly don't go as far as #3 myself, and I'm not fond of it when people insist getting more directly involved is absolutely the right choice and will lead to the best result. On the other hand, I find it no worse than those who are convinced that doing so absolutely will lead to nuclear war, but we'll clearly avoid that fate if we just sit back and watch.

Here's a Kurtzgesagt video that goes into what would happen if we nuked a city: https://youtu.be/5iPH-br_eJQ

Basically, Russia and the US each have around 6,000 nuclear warheads, so imagine that video but instead of just happening once to a single city, it's almost every major city in the northern hemisphere, plus high-value targets like infrastructure. Major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Houston, London, etc. may even be hit a few times to ensure complete destruction.

And you might want to multiply the environmental impacts too - many people very far away from the blast zones will suffer the effects of extended exposure to radiation, just due to the sheer volume of material released.

Regardless, NATO would have to fire one in kind less the russians think NATO is soft and call the bluff. The retaliation would most likely be met with more retaliation and then bam they all go off. 

If Moscow were to be directly threatened russia would just launch them all at once. The nukes would come from silos, mobile trucks, submarines, and bombers. 

The first the detonation take out military installations and population centers. Each would get multiple warheads. This part would be over very quickly.

Then the fallout spreads. There won't be a place on earth you can escape this. Although, in the southern hemisphere it would still be relatively liveable. This would take a few weeks for all the radiation to spread. 

Lastly, nuclear winter. Particulates from the explosions will block out the sun. The average temperature on earth would drop waaaaay below freezing. Even on the equator you'd probably experience -20 f. 

The winter would last decades and the areas that were directly nuked may take hundreds of years if not thousandsto become safe again.

Massive  retaliation basically mean if you send a nuke even a single one, the USA sends enough to turn Russia into a parking lot. Russia knows this which leads to the 2nd things I thinks is important.

2nd strike capabilities is the abilitiy of a nation to take a 1st strike and return nukes. Basically without a credible 2nd strike capacity why wouldn’t Russia just preemptively take out every place we have nukes and level all cities before we could respond. For the USA it’s the 4-5 nuclear subs we have deployed at all times. They can stay underwater for 3 months and are incredibly hard to find.

The treaty they signed was the Budapest Memorandum. But NATO won’t intervene because Russia has nukes, of course, and that includes something called tactical nuclear weapons, i.e., nukes to be used in battle.

Putin has been planning this invasion for years, since at least 2014 when Russia launched a smaller invasion in Ukraine and took over the region of Crimea. 

In response to the current invasion, the defense alliance NATO, which consists of the United States and most Western European nations, announced crushing sanctions versus Russia, causing much of the country’s economy to be frozen. 

While the situation in Ukraine is dire, the Ukrainian people are mounting a heroic defense of their nation and have mostly stalled the Russian invasion for the last week. NATO is currently not in the fight but is on high alert if Putin steps onto their territory.

As much as I want to cheer for Ukraine, they are facing a much bigger enemy with a lot of stored resources to throw at them. People here are crowing about Russian tactical ineptitude on the field, but if you read history, that's a constant in Russian warfare, win or lose. Russia wins by overwhelming numbers, not superior tactics. We've seen figures for Russian losses ranging from 500 to 10k troops, along with dozens of planes, hundreds of tanks, etc... know what I can't find? Any casualty figures for Ukraine troops. That means that the number isn't good.

What I fear is that in a firefight where Russians lose 10, and Ukraine loses 2, that's an overall win for Russia. Russian military tactics have always treated their infantry as expendable and replaceable, and this has worked for them repeatedly over history.

Absent NATO action, this ends with Russia taking over all of Ukraine's gas/oil fields, along with the waterways feeding to Crimea, securing them, and declaring ""victory"" at home. That logistically gives Putin the monopoly on energy production that he's been seeking for decades - that's the lever he wants to hold so that he can use it against Europe.

Wheeling some nukes into Ukraine at this point would be a pretty odd way for NATO to escalate things. And I can't imagine it going well. Ukraine would have to say ""we have nukes now, and we'll launch them if you do not withdraw all troops immediately."" There's almost no way Russia would accept that. I think they'd call the bluff and push the invasion even harder. And it would almost certainly be a bluff.

NATO's worry is that if they do step in, obviously they'd wipe the floor with Russia's conventional forces given the demonstrable problems that Russia has. And seeing a massive portion of their military just melt away before their eyes is going to put a lot of high level military people, and especially Putin, in a bad place.

The chances that he would reach towards nuclear weapons is non-trivial in such a situation. A full nuclear exchange isn't just ""The West/NATO dies."" it's an extinction level event. Meaning that if the nukes fly, then Ukraine dies even if it happens to not be a target.

Right now Ukraine is on a path towards victory. A PAINFUL victory, but a victory in either case. If nothing changes, then Russia WILL lose at this rate and Ukraine will not only come out victorious but the international support for rebuilding will be immense.

I DO have a gun and could just end the fight at the drop of a hat in your favor, except for ""reasons"", if I pull the trigger to shoot the guy you are fighting there is a chance it will explode and kill all three of us. Nobody knows how large or small the chance is, but it exists.

So which would you prefer? Instantly ""win"" the fight but maybe die because I pulled that trigger? Or gradually and painfully win the fight with a guarantee you're going to survive?

And on top of that, just because YOU might be willing to take that risk doesn't mean I as the owner of the gun am. I might say ""You've got this, you don't need me to risk killing us all."" and keep doing what I'm doing.",False,1646437847.0,t3_t6w5x7,t1_hzduleh,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

It's very much possible that it's the actual supplies missing. 

(Just as an example)
If you produce 100 barrels of oil in a day and spread them out 50% for the military and 50% for civil use, you can't just casually take them out of the economy, because your military actually uses 60 barrels of oil in a day. The Russian economy is already at an incredible low and forcing the Russian people themselves into shortages won't help that either. 

Plus, you can't just magically let a tank's fuel fill up in an instant. The fuel needs to get wherever the tank gills up, the food needs to be transported to the soldiers, etc.

Let's say he stopped the attack right now, pulled all troops out of Ukraine, and didn't make a peep for a month.

The sanctions may stay, but some things absolutely wouldn't happen.

1. If even found guilty of war crimes, as long as Putin stayed in Russia, he wouldn't be punished beyond existing sanctions. If Ukraine being invaded isn't enough to risk WW3, then it won't be risked to forcibly remove Putin from within Russian borders.

2. Putin won't be overthrown. Thousands of Russian anti-war protesters have been arrested, and they were already a minority. The rest of Russians either support Putin, don't care either way, or don't support the invasion but don't want to speak out for fear of punishment.

But even here, the world is wary. One country, Canada, has barred Russian oil imports and others are debating it. Some 70 per cent of Russian crude was “struggling to find buyers” this week, said the consultancy Energy Aspects. As a result, Russian oil was selling at a discount of more than $US18 a barrel.  
  
“In reality,” reported London’s Financial Times, “many Western banks, refineries and shipowners are in effect ‘self sanctioning’ – behaving as if Russian oil has already been placed under sanctions. ‘Russia’s oil has effectively become toxic,’ said one banker.”  
  
The prominent Russian economist Maxim Mironov writes: “I’m often asked about economic sanctions. In short, my scientific conclusion, as a finance professor and PhD from Chicago University – the Russian economy is f---ed.”  
  
Even worse, he wrote, was that most Russian citizens, “even the educated ones, for the most part don’t realise what awaits them,” according to an English translation supplied by the former Australian diplomat Dmitry Grozoubinski on Twitter.  
  
And that is? “Very soon, Russians will be faced with shortfalls of basic products. I’m not talking about iPhones, the import of which was already banned, but about food, clothing, cars, whitegoods, etc.” Planes, almost all imported, eventually would stop flying because their makers are cutting off supply of parts. And so on.  
As for the Russian central bank’s remaining foreign exchange reserves, says Mironov, “it’s going to be hard to find a central bank on earth willing to buy from the Russian central bank, so as not to find itself sanctioned or facing massive fines”.  
Well, there might be one. And, if not China’s central bank, some of its state-owned enterprises. As world markets have recoiled from Russian products, the rulers of world’s second biggest economy have taken a markedly different stance.  
“China and Russia will continue to conduct normal trade co-operation in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.  
Actually, Beijing is going beyond “normal trade co-operation”. It’s giving Russia special assistance. For example, it’s been widely noted that China last week dropped its restrictions on imports of wheat from Russia. Wheat is one of Russia’s top export items.  
Was it just a remarkable coincidence that Beijing’s concerns over phytosanitary problems with Russian wheat were resolved on the very day that Putin’s missiles started to slam into the Ukrainian capital? It was not. The wheat concession was one of a package of more than 10 agreements struck between Putin and Xi when they signed their so-called “no limits” partnership agreement at the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics last month.  
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began the day after the Olympics closing ceremony. This was no coincidence, either, according to a report by The New York Times. It reported this week that China had asked Russia to delay the invasion until the Games were finished, according to what the NYT described as Western intelligence reports.",False,1646439632.0,t3_t6w5x7,t1_hzdztp3,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

However, Russia excels at compelling the U.S. to self-deter.

> Besides military pressure, the U.S. also failed to consider graduated response options once Putin’s preferred course of action had been established. The U.S. could have imposed targeted sanctions on Russian leadership or introduced long-overdue anti-corruption legislation to signal the impending costs of reinvasion to the Kremlin. By choosing to view these options through an all-or-nothing lens, the U.S. unnecessarily constrained its response. Biden’s administration was reactive when it should have been proactive. Over and over, the president’s longtime senior advisers seem to have recommended narrow, low-risk policy options, and these backfired.

On September 1, 1983, the South Korean airliner servicing the flight was shot down by a Soviet Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but due to a navigational mistake made by the KAL crew the airliner deviated from its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace around the time of a U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission.

The Soviet famine of 1932–1933 was a famine in the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union, including Ukraine, Northern Caucasus, Volga Region, Kazakhstan,\[6\] the South Urals, and West Siberia.\[7\]\[8\] About 5.7 to 8.7 million people are estimated to have lost their lives. Joseph Stalin and other party members had ordered that kulaks were ""to be liquidated as a class"",\[9\]\[a\] and became a target for the state. The richer, land-owning peasants were labeled kulaks and were portrayed by the Bolsheviks as class enemies,\[13\] which culminated in a Soviet campaign of political repressions, including arrests, deportations, and executions of large numbers of the better-off peasants and their families in 1929–1932.\[14\]",False,1646444353.0,t3_t6w5x7,t1_hze9ll8,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

The implication, of course, is that Beijing had advance knowledge of Putin’s invasion plans.  
  
Other deals signed by the two autocrats as part of the “no limits” partnership were long-term supply contracts for China to buy an estimated $US117 billion worth of Russian oil and gas. Total Sino-Russia trade boomed last year by 36 per cent from a year earlier to a record high of $US147 billion. They’ve set themselves a target of $US250 billion in two-way trade by 2025. War crimes? What war crimes?  
  
It’s pretty much effortless for China to support Russia economically. China’s annual economic output was worth $US16 trillion last year, exactly 10 times the size of Russia’s $US1.6 trillion. And, after the collapse of the rouble this week, Russia’s economy is axiomatically worth about one-third less than it was a week ago, measured in US dollars.  
  
China is attracting a rising chorus of Western criticism, led by Australia’s Scott Morrison, for its tacit approval of the Russian invasion. China conspicuously has refused to condemn the invasion, or even use the word. It has stuck to Putin’s talking points by calling it “a special military operation”. And Beijing has abstained from voting on UN resolutions critical of Moscow’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine.  
  
Morrison, closely mimicked by Labor, has been doing his best to inflict reputational damage on Xi. He’s on solid ground. After 70 years of declaring sovereign borders to be sacrosanct, the Chinese Communist Party is now prepared to condone, even support, a blatant Russian violation of Ukraine’s sovereign borders.  
  
Morrison is putting Xi’s hypocrisy up in lights for the world to see for two reasons. First, he hopes it will help harden international opposition to the unprincipled expansionism of China, as well as Russia. Second, it boosts Morrison’s election campaign priority of national security, allowing him to draw attention to the threats to Australia which, he’ll claim, only a Coalition government can handle.  
Some Western analysts believe Beijing has made a terrible mistake. In Washington, Jude Blanchette of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies described it as “an extraordinary blunder” by Xi. And Elizabeth Wishnick, a senior research scientist at American non-profit research outfit CNA, said “China is in a lose-lose situation with respect to Ukraine”, according to The South China Morning Post. “If a Russian puppet state results from this conflict, Chinese companies will face sanctions.”  
Lose-lose? That’s not how China’s leader sees it. A Russian puppet state sounds perfect to Xi. Till now, Moscow has been a junior partner in the relationship. What is the loss of a junior partner if he can acquire a puppet, at rock bottom price?  
In truth, Xi wasn’t gulled by a Machiavellian Putin into pre-emptive support for an atrocity, now finding himself helplessly handcuffed to an international pariah accused of war crimes. On the contrary, Xi was the chief architect of their “no limits” pact. Xi initiated work on the agreement in November, according to Lingling Wei’s reporting in The Wall Street Journal. It was Beijing that proposed the signature term “no limits”. The evidence is mounting that Xi knew of the forthcoming invasion and positioned China to be uniquely supportive.",False,1646439667.0,t3_t6w5x7,t1_hzdzw2i,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

To address your original question - and apologies if I’m stating the obvious:

-	If NATO establishes a No-Fly Zone over Ukraine, they do so by putting NATO fighters in Ukrainian airspace to attack any unauthorized aircraft.  (Russians)
-	Once they are confronted with a Russian aircraft that enters the NFZ and peacefully or violently refuses to leave the airspace, they are forced to fire on that craft.
-	At that point, shots have been fired in anger between NATO and Russia.  This can very easily be defined as an act of war and now we have a conflict between NATO and Russia.  I’m fairly certain that Mr. Putin would consider it an act of war.
-	Putin’s actions have brought into question his current mental state and that has many worried that any escalation of direct conflict with NATO makes a nuclear exchange a strong possibility.

Of course, we’re escalating economically, technologically, and by supplying Ukraine with tons of armaments.  So the ultimate point is the rules of war are nonsensical but we’re walking a razors edge to not escalate into a direct military conflict between nuclear powers.

But with ICBM's there is a longer amount of time that you get to react to the launch. This is an assumption but short range missiles are much cheaper and easier to produce. With missiles on the boarder you can mount a massive assault with short range missiles and cause massive amounts of damage in a very quick amount of time. Also us having military bases in Ukraine would allow us to do what Russia is doing to them with a massive land strike.

Additionally, even in an absolute worst case scenario, there would be less than 100,000 deaths on the Ukrainian side. That's an enormous number and would without a doubt constitute a humanitarian disaster. However, on a population of 44,000,000 that doesn't come in the region of ""certain death"".

Yet, say there is even a 1% of nuclear escalation if NATO establishes a no-fly zone. In that scenario, say half the global population dies (which is a low estimate since we are looking at total collapse of civilization), but let's call it half. Calculating that through on ""average"" we would loose 1% of 4 billion people or 40 million if we intervene. If we don't intervene, we on ""average"" would lose less than 100,000 every time.

It's a really bad game of chicken and the west needs to keep it so that putin is the aggressor. 

Putin can make all of this stop by withdrawing  and taking a more diplomatic route, however he can no longer leave Russia ever. And the west will keep sanctions in place until he's gone.

What will Xi do now? Kevin Rudd, an authority on China, has no doubt: “China’s statecraft is always long-term. There’s no way in the world, having secured Russia’s foot in the Chinese camp, that Xi will abandon Putin in his hour of financial and economic need.  
  
“In fact, Xi will see this as an opportunity to entrench China’s influence over Russia. At the same time, China will seek to limit the hit on themselves by acting as mediator. It’s an open question whether that would have any effect \[in protecting China’s reputation\] in the real world.  
  
“China’s leadership has been stunned by the level of global reaction to the invasion of Ukraine and stunned, furthermore, that rather than forcing the Europeans to capitulate, it’s caused European strategic determination to harden, as evidenced by the 180-degree turnaround by Germany.”  
  
For Xi, an accelerating confrontation with the West would be a fair price to pay for acquiring Russia as a vassal state. Russia would owe China its viability as a functioning state, and Vladimir Putin would be indebted to Xi for the survival of his regime.

But it’s a war against a major nuclear power - it’s not worth the risk to compare ukraine getting fucked up vs. The whole world getting fucked up. 

Three points:

1. Putin will die in the next 10-20 years (or sooner if the regime gets unhappy) so no we won’t live with him forever.

I would say some soldiers deserts when things look hopeless, some surrender but its up to the military leaders to know when to retreat or stop. Obviously ukraine is not at that point yet.

When Armenia capitulated against Azerbaijan people revolted and wanted to attack the president as traitor
But he has little left to defend and said about 30k troops were pretty much incircled and going forward then would have died unless he capitulated.

My take the military should fight as they can still resist Russians advances.
Reserves can be activated and used. Dont put people without training in battle against professional army only people who understand the comms, tactics and know their Tasks.

You're already operating on an assumption that a war between NATO would naturally escalate to a nuclear one.

I’ll be the first to say I’m not an expert on everything NATO. However I do understand this conflict pretty well as it’s been going on for several years. Also partly because it, in a way, could directly impact my life. My husband is an active duty US soldier. He’s assigned to a brigade currently deployed to Eastern Europe as a result of everything. Situations like this really makes a person want to fully understand the reasons behind why their loved one could be sent into war.

Everything really is just stacked against the Ukrainians. It’s easy to blame NATO for not doing more, but it’s just a shit situation from all angles if they do. My heart breaks for the citizens of Ukraine. They did nothing to be in this completely unnecessary war. However, they are proving to the entire world that they are one hell of a country and will fiercely defend their independence.

So I’m not much worried about my husband being dragged into war at this point. It’s Putin that brings me a little bit of anxiety. He seems irrational and extremely vengeful. Everything can be flipped upside down and full blown WW3 could be on our doorstep if he just decided to take that route. The poor Russian citizens have this unhinged leader and have no authority to remove him from office. I do hope their parliament can do something about him once everything is over with.
