No doubt the Russian public when they get wise to that would be unhappy, these are Slavic cities, and Kieve is one of the cradles of Russian civilization. Add to that the sanctions affecting Oligarch and citizen alike and its potentially dangerous for Putin- this is his war, and his alone, that makes him vulnerable in a way he never has been.

And adding to that, beyond the terrible unspeakable losses incurred to the Ukrainians, demolishing cities doesn't work well for a swift victory- it enrages natives and creates a perfect environment for defensive operations.

First, today there's a referendum about constitutional reform being held in Belarus. It was planned long before the war started.

This would mean both military action in Ukraine, as well as housing Russian nukes, would no longer be anticonstitutional. 

Second, there's a lot of talk about it being useless to move nukes because they are intercontinental. This is false. ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missiles) are just delivery systems. They can carry nuclear or conventional payloads, and are, as the name suggests meant for long range use. Nuclear warheads can also be placed on medium and short range missiles. Until the Trump presidency, this was banned in Europe by a treaty. The US then decided to leave the treaty, which caused the Russians to start considering placing them in Belarus.

So what it happening is that, potentially, short to medium range nukes could be placed in Belarus as military posturing in Europe shifts. There is no talk, or expectation, of these being used.

The two likeliest outcomes being Russia destroys Ukraine and is sanctioned to death by the west, or Russia’s military is exposed as a paper tiger (and is also sanctioned to death by the west). Either way, Russia comes out of this far worse than they were beforehand. With the west shutting Russian trading out, that cuts competition allowing China to get better prices when they continue to trade with Russia. As their only option this weakens Russia and strengthens China. Prior to this, the USA was the worlds number one super power with Russia and China vying for 2nd place. I think we all realize now China had it by a long shot, but perception didn’t match reality. After this, Russia’s economy will be in shambles for a generation, and may even see a full coup. This drives all the countries who formerly were under Russias sphere of influence more firmly into Chinas. 

China seems to be doing just enough to not get sanctioned by supporting Russia without looking like they turned their back on them. They don’t lose face with any smaller countries who look towards China as a major influencer.

My friend sent me a series of notes from a journalist stuck in Kyiv to get distracted and….**

In January, an amazing and truly amazing event took place for Russia and all the countries of the former union: the culture of cancelling and feminism, perhaps for the first time, worked the way it should - not on a star or politics, but on an ordinary asshole.

**There was a guy - Egor Belikov. He is a journalist, a film critic**. Moderately famous, but writing Notes for several journals with his very important opinion on which Hollywood movies are worth watching and which are not. Nothing special. **In January, he had an argument with his girlfriend and as a result he punched her.** **And she went to the police and wrote a post about accident in her Facebook**. She said that he was a vile manipulator, that he used psychological abuse, said nasty things and insulted. And he's a really bad guy.

After a few days this post somehow received almost All-Russian coverage and support. **Almost everyone began to hate Belikov.** Then other girls who had met him over the past ten years began to appear: it seemed that he didn’t beat anyone anymore, but like other abusers, he depreciated the woman and the relationship with her, verbally humiliated.

Belikov became at some point probably the most unpleasant and avoided person in Moscow.

**He was fired from all jobs, even small magazines refused to cooperate.** *He donated an amount like a month's salary to an anti-violence fund, publicly apologized several times, said he would work with a therapist to change.*

Recently it turned out that after all this story, **Belikov decided to unwind and flew to Europe “For a week**”, you can understand, since in Russia his life really turned into hell. He decided to return from Denmark on February 23. **He took back tickets to Kyiv**, since it was much cheaper to fly there than to Moscow, and, as you already know, he was fired from everywhere. After all he planned to go Kiev-Belarus-Moscow.

Then began the movie ""Terminal"" with Tom Hanks.

**A man with a Russian passport, of course, was not even let out of the airport - he lived for a day with several other Russians in the Kiev terminal, spending the night in Duty Free and eating what he was able to find.**

On the afternoon of February 24, the Ukrainians closed the airport, gave him an entry stamp and **sent him to the SBU (Ukrainian equivalent of the KGB)**, who, of course, assumed he was a Russian spy.

**By evening of February 25, he was back on the streets**, trying to contact some of his Ukrainian acquaintances who might not be aware of his ""Russian history"" **without money** (since ATMs stopped dispensing cash and do not accept Russian cards) and without communication (since Ukraine has blocked Russian SIM cards on its territory.

**He tried to contact the Russian embassy, ​​but they told him: “dude, do you understand that we have REALLY BIG PROBLEMS right now?”.**

**He also cannot become a refugee** \- after all, he is Russian, not Ukrainian. **As a result, he found some Kiev students who agreed to shelter him and now they are sitting together in a bomb shelter.**

Probably now he is thinking about karma and that his next relationships should definitely be healthy or they should not be at all.Yesterday, one of the independent anti-Putin media agreed to publish an article with his story and, yes, it really deserves to be filmed - this is definitely a much more funny and instructive story than TinderSwinder shit or Anna Delvi's romanticization.

My Dad has been saying how part of the reason Russia invaded Ukraine is that they don't want Ukraine to join NATO since that could lead to Ukraine having nuclear weapons on Russia's doorstep. And he has repeatedly drawn a parallel to the Cuban Missile Crisis and how America took military action to stop Russia having nukes near the US. He said if Russia and Mexico or Canada hypothetically got friendly and started having nuclear weapons on the border it would be the same thing with America invading and doing everything it can to prevent this scenario.

I don't really know how to counter this argument since he knows a lot more about politics than I do. What he's saying makes sense to me but also I don't recall hearing much about Ukraine joining NATO. All I am reading is how this is a conquest for Putin to gain land and rebuild the USSR. So I don't know if what he's saying is an apt comparison. Does anyone have a good counter argument to that.

I know Ukraine agreed to give up their nukes in a treaty years ago I don't know if that would still apply.",False,1645958688.0,t3_t2kcul,t3_t2kcul,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

1. Putin wins this war. That means removing the current Ukranian government and installing a loyal pupet state. There will be a certain rise of patriotism in Russia, everybody breathes out. Some deals are made Russia's economy shifts much closer to India and China using its own bootleg swift-system that is now used internally. The healing process is started.

2 Putin semi-wins this war. That means Ukranian government is still in power but Ukraine loses Crimea, DPR and LPR. Economically it is still close to the first variant.


These two still leave us in the brave new world with two blokes: China-centered and US-ventered. 


3Putin doesn't win this war. That means either the war becoming unsustainable for Russia and Ukraine with the financial help from the west takes its territories back or the war lasts for a long time. Then I can see him being removed and regime change in Russia. This either leaves us in the current status-quo or might even lead to Westernisation of Russia if US decides not to kick it while it is one the ground this time.

100 conscripts were abandoned in a train station in Russia for 5 days while the rest of their unit deployed. The had no rations and their mothers had to get to the station to feed these kids. Their mothers complained to an NGO.

That's why Ukrainian military are having these conscript POWs call their mothers because they understand the Russian military inherited the Soviet military tradition of mandatory conscription and then beating them and treating them like crap and using them as expendable cannon fodder.

However, I do not think he predicted this level of backlash from the international community nor the amount of, or level of sanctions imposed against Russia.  Keep in mind, that more sanctions are being planned to directly target the Russian Central Bank as well as targeting the methods Russia may use to get around sanctions.   This will mean that attempts by the central bank to artificially prop up the value of the ruble will most likely fail or at least be much more difficult.   Another issue is the lack of raw materials in Russia as well.  Russia relies on China heavily for trade, but still needs certain raw materials and resources from the west, which it is no longer receiving.

Nations like Turkey are likely going to start pushing in Syria, Libya, Azerbaijan, and if Ukraine survives then Ukraine as well, challenging Russian influences in those nations and the greater region.

First and fucking foremost - The US has never threatened the world at large with nukes so that it could invade.

Second - Saddam Hussein had already committed genocide against his people he killed about 200,000 Kurds. He was a non elected dictator not a freely elected leader. 

Third - The US had quite a bit of international support to go into Iraq. Both times

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq

Fourth - Libya involvement was actually the UN and NATO with the US providing a bulk of the support due to the request.

https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2011)

Fifth - Afghanistan was also supported by a dozen or more powerful countries, many of which are in the Middle East.

There can’t be, because Russia has been quite transparent. Putting wants his toy back, someone made them give them all away when he was kid and he’s being a little shithead to do it.

It's unrealistic to assume that native populations wouldn't have a turn against taking in foreign refugees that are from a completely different culture. Europe has always taken in a good number of refugees. Sure there is generally resistance from people that fall on more right of the spectrum - but the support is there. Secondly - it can be argued that eastern / asian / Arab countries have had a history of being underwhelming in their refugee in take. Thirdly, even in my extended family - integration into western society is another difficulty.

The thing is, it's not an accurate picture of NATO. Sure, if Russia is being aggressive, they'll oppose Russia, but it is a *defensive* alliance. A lot of people questioned the purpose of NATO after the end of the soviet union. It shifted its focus to terrorism after September 11th. Russia wasn't an issue until Russia started taking chunks out of its neighbors.

The ""nukes on the border"" argument (which doesn't even make that much sense in the era of ICBMs, amongst other things) is only valid insofar as the US or NATO is interested in starting a war with Russia. Nobody is going to invade Russia. Nobody is going to nuke Russia. Few people even thought of Russia as an adversary before 2014... just look at the reactions to the presidential debate in 2012 where Romney suggested Russia was the #1 geopolitical threat, he was nearly laughed out of the room.

If Putin feels threatened by NATO it is only because he provoked NATO out of his own insecurities. That gives him no right to invade a sovereign, democratic nation.

Side note: I believe this started (in 2014) because Ukraine wanted to join the **EU**. I'm not sure they had any interest in NATO until Russia had already invaded Crimea.

Edit:

>In September 2013, Russia warned that **if Ukraine went ahead with a planned free trade agreement with the European Union**, it would face financial catastrophe and possibly the collapse of the state.[170] Sergey Glazyev, adviser to President Vladimir Putin, said, **""Ukrainian authorities are making a huge mistake if they think that the Russian reaction will become neutral in a few years from now. This will not happen.""** Russia had already imposed import restrictions on certain Ukrainian products and Glazyev did not rule out further sanctions if the agreement was signed. Glazyev allowed for the possibility of separatist movements springing up in the Russian-speaking east and south of Ukraine. He insisted that, if Ukraine signed the agreement, it would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries borders. Russia would no longer guarantee Ukraine's status as a state and could possibly intervene if pro-Russian regions of the country appealed directly to Russia.[170]

For instance, Kiev has been conquered many times by different armies, including: Pechenegs, various Rus princes, the Mongols, Lithuanian army (led by Grand Duke Gediminas), the Tatars, Germans, and Russians. 

From the end of 1918 to August 1920, Kyiv changed hands sixteen times. During the Great Famine of 1932-1933, many people died of starvation in Kyiv (esp the migrant population). And Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of 1937–1938 almost eliminated the city's intelligentsia.

The city suffered significant damage during WWII. Nazi Germany occupied it from September 19th, 1941 to November 6th, 1943. Axis forces killed or captured more than 600,000 Soviet soldiers in the great encirclement Battle of Kyiv in 1941. And during WWII, it is estimated that the Germans murdered more than 100,000 people of various ethnic groups, mostly civilians, at Babi Yar. 

Kyiv recovered economically in the post-war years, becoming once again the third-most important city of the Soviet Union. The catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 occurred only 100 km (62 mi) north of the city. However, the prevailing south wind blew most of the radioactive debris away from Kyiv. 

Kyiv had a lucky break in 1986 when the prevailing winds were from the South and East. Let's pray that Kyiv can hold out in the coming days and weeks against Russian forces.",False,1645961161.0,t3_t2kcul,t1_hymphlx,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Russia explicitly does not want to be bogged down. On any level. Not diplomatically, not strategically, not tactically. They don't want to be executing COIN operations, so speed is of the essence, hence their extensive use of high tempo operations (paradrops, overextended armored thrusts, marine assaults, unsupported infantry pushes).

Putin does NOT want to level Ukraine, contrary to some of the hysterics here, he very much wants Ukraine in a position to be at least a *semi-pliant* buffer state and that does not work if he goes Grozny on Kyiv. So he's throwing his incompetent military and having his generals plan assaults by committee, hence, the use of supposedly elite formations of VDV, Spetsnaz, etc being pushed into high risk operations like drops into contested airspaces resulted in DISASTROUS losses.

The idea that the Russians would throw away lives just to absorb bullets is part of a literal Nazi myth. Post-war, Hitler's generals attempted to explain away their own failures and distances themselves from the Nazi regime and Hitler in particular, laying much of the failure at his feet. But the other side of that, the mental gymnastics needed to square the fact that the Aryan super-race had lost in battle to the supposedly inferior Slavs. The solution? The Slavs buried our noble warriors under wave after wave of poorly trained conscripts and dragged them down with no regard for their own lives, the savages!

Look at wiki:
A proxy war is an armed conflict between two states or non-state actors which act on the instigation or on behalf of other parties that are not directly involved in the hostilities.[1] In order for a conflict to be considered a proxy war, there must be a direct, long-term relationship between external actors and the belligerents involved.[2] The aforementioned relationship usually takes the form of funding, military training, arms, or other forms of material assistance which assist a belligerent party in sustaining its war effort.[2]

It was created due to a run on banks that exasperated the Great Depression; if you have money in an American bank, the FDIC makes sure you'll get your money even if the bank collapses.

[The US government will automatically guarantee up to $250,000.](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/brochures/deposits-at-a-glance/)

EDIT: Ah, I see your edit. I guess I'm making a logical leap here:

Run on bank == bank out of cash == bank failure

Russians can't exchange it for anything other than gold. Per that $250,000 link I mentioned earlier:

> A bank failure is the closing of a bank by a federal or state banking regulatory agency, generally resulting from a bank's inability to meet its obligations to depositors and others.

Seems like that is a very real possibility in Russia. In the US it seems as if a run on banks could trigger the FDIC, but I'm not sure if Russia has the same protections.

Otherwise, if the money is fine... Surely it's okay to leave it in the bank, right?",1645962307.0,1645961798.0,t3_t2kcul,t1_hymtpo4,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

One time down a wikipedia rabbit hole I learned that at the start of WW1, most of the ottoman leaders were leaning to the side of the entente, except one guy who liked the germans because he had basically been on an internship there.

Then before they had decided, Churchill appropriated two battleships british companies had just built for the ottomans

then the germans offered to build them some instead

then while the german crew of one of them was sailing it to turkey for delivery, the guy who liked germany had the crew [attack russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_raid),

then russia declared war, and the ottomans were just like, ""eh, I guess we're on the germans' side now""

then churchill tried to invade the dardanelles and got fked, but really fired up the ottomans

then if the ottomans hadn't been blocking the dardanelle then the western powers would have helped the whites while the civil war was close

then the breakup of the ottoman empire and the way they got treated by the british after ww2 left lots of really unhappy people in the middle east

so yeah you can kinda blame churchill for like half of the world's problems

The US army and navy is built around offense, since nobody is stupid enough to even attempt to invade the mainland US and the national guard and hillbillies with guns can more than handle any army that somehow makes it. Russia and most other militaries were developed with a completely different doctrine since no other country is nearly as safe from invasion as the US. 

Russia is also holding back at least somewhat. They aren't carpet bombing the shit out of cities yet. They aren't using a lot of other tactics used in the middle east.

Right. Out of respect for. Nowhere was it implied it was real footage.

>> A YouTube user “Comrade_Corb,” who posted the clip on Feb. 24, wrote in the caption that the video is from the digital battlefield game, Digital Combat Simulator. “This footage is from DCS, but is nevertheless made out of respect for ‘The Ghost of Kiev,’” the user wrote without providing further identification.

Again, out of respect for. No one claimed it was the Ghost.

The reason I don't bring directly quoted numbers as you did is two-fold:


#1: these are subject to a much wider debate than I intend to have with you, and Nazi apologists like to minimise some numbers and conflate others. 


#2: any info from the ""black book of communism"" is immediately refuted as it includes people killed defending against the Nazis as victims of communism.
