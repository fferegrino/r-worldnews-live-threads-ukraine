Day 452-454 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days really weren’t quiet at all. After the incursion into Russia started yesterday, Russians launched many missiles from Belgorod, but for some reason they decided to not target the forces that are invading their territory and instead use their missiles on Kharkiv oblast, and it doesn’t look like they hit anything important at all. They targeted civilians yet again, and some of the missiles even landed in empty fields.

Their choice of targets never ceases to surprise me, they almost never use their missiles to hit military targets, even when they are in the open and literally attacking them right at that moment. When news about fighting in Belgorod oblast were popping up, Russians started launching missiles from Belgorod, but instead of targeting the attacking forces they hit Kharkiv’s suburbs instead. Brilliant choice of targets. 

We were pretty surprised when we heard explosions, they were literally being attacked right at that moment, they knew where to hit and yet they decided to target civilians in Kharkiv oblast instead, and they did it multiple times in a single day as well. They launched at least 3 separate missiles strikes throughout the day and we heard the explosions each time, which means they were hitting roughly the same area near Kharkiv every single time.

It's really baffling how their side of the border is completely unguarded, pretty much anyone can cross it with no resistance. That entire region of Russia was their staging area for the invasion and now they don’t even have any real border guards there? That is hilariously incompetent, they really thought that nobody would dare to invade them back, so they just left the border unprotected. It will be interesting to see how the situation will develop next, it would be really funny if the FRL managed to hold some border towns indefinitely.",False,1684882916.0,t3_13pde7p,t3_13pde7p,,0,147,0,147,0,0,

Following the Second Battle of Lyman, which saw a Ukrainian victory, Lapin was heavily criticized by the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov blamed Lapin for the Russian retreat, saying he would demote Lapin to the rank of private, strip him of his medals, and send him to the front line barefoot with a light machine gun to ""wipe away his shame with blood"". The Kremlin told Kadyrov to ""set aside emotions"" during the ""special military operation"".[12]",1684848540.0,1684847851.0,t3_13pde7p,t3_13pde7p,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

“We have not yet summed up the results of the day together with the Russians Volunteer Corps, but we can say that today the Legionnaires made a fuss among Putin's horde: we ""demilitarized"" a motorized rifle company of the RF Armed Forces, destroyed several units of their armored vehicles.

We don’t idle talk like the Kremlin propagandists who attribute fictitious losses to us, so in the near future you will see video confirmation of our actions🫡

In contrast to the ""heroic"" army, drawn for the reports of bald mole [Putin] in the Kremlin, Putin's troops didn’t excel during these days.

With the operator within as much as a hundred meters of the vehicle it can proceed to the casualty under withering enemy fire. Up to four casualties can hop onto the flat platform as it speeds off at the breezy 15 mph! 

The go-kart has top-secret electric technology that makes it invisible to enemy optics. It even has a camera so the operator can operate without having to maintain a line of sight!

>It will take “several months at best” to get F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Monday.

>The administration has provided few details of the plan to equip the Ukrainian Air Force with the US-made jets or other fourth-generation aircraft after President Joe Biden announced on Friday the US would support a joint training effort, such as who will provide the aircraft or where it will take place. US personnel will participate in the training alongside allies and partners in Europe. 

>“It’s been in the works, and there’s obviously been interest from Ukraine in getting that kind of capability,” Kendall told reporters at the Defense Writers Group. He said there are “a lot of open possibilities, including our partners.”

>Kendall said it would take at least “several months” before Ukraine would have the capability to operate F-16s, and a number of details have to be worked out before Ukraine’s air force will be able to fly Western jets in large numbers. 

>“We are not under any circumstances going to get F-16s or another Western fighter in significant numbers into the hands of the Ukrainian Air Force in something less than at least several months,” Kendall said.

>But it’s still a relatively rapid timeline, since it normally takes more than two years to train a new US pilot on the aircraft, according to an Air Force official. Even a refresher course for an F-16 pilot who has stepped away from flying the jet for a period can take up to five months. 

>Publicly, the US had argued for months that fighter jets were not at the top of the priority list and would quickly drain the available funding for Ukraine aid instead of more important weapons like Abrams tanks and Patriot missiles. Kendall described what appeared to be a sudden about-face for the Biden administration as a decision that it was the right time to begin preparing Ukraine’s military for the future.

>“Ukraine is going to remain an independent nation,” said Kendall. ""It’s going to need a full suite of military capabilities for its requirements, and so it’s time to start thinking longer term about what that military might look like and what it will include.”

Artillery had churned up so much earth that you could no longer distinguish between craters and the natural topography.

>Syava’s battalion, which numbered about six hundred men, was posted on the edge of a village south of Bakhmut. The village was controlled by the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization notorious for committing atrocities in Africa and the Middle East. For the war in Ukraine, Wagner recruited thousands of inmates from Russian prisons by offering them pardons in exchange for combat tours. The onslaught of expendable convicts proved too much for the Ukrainians, who were still reeling from Kherson and had not yet replenished their ranks and matériel. The commander of the battalion, a thirty-nine-year-old lieutenant colonel named Pavlo, said of the Wagner fighters, “They were like zombies. They used the prisoners like a wall of meat. It didn’t matter how many we killed—they kept coming.”
>
>Within weeks, the battalion faced annihilation: entire platoons had been wiped out in close-contact firefights, and some seventy men had been encircled and massacred. The dwindling survivors, one officer told me, “became useless because they were so tired.” In January, what was left of the battalion retreated from the village and established defensive positions in the tree lines and open farmland a mile to the west.
>
>The Russian mercenaries subsequently left for Bakhmut, to shore up other forces there, and the conventional troops who replaced them were far less numerous and suicidal. By the time I joined the battalion, about two months had passed since it had lost the battle for the village, and during the interim neither side had attempted a major operation against the other. It was all the Ukrainians could do to maintain the stalemate. Pavlo estimated that, owing to the casualties his unit had sustained, eighty per cent of his men were new draftees. “They’re civilians with no experience,” he said. “If they give me ten, I’m lucky when three of them can fight.”
>
>…
>
>At the 28th Brigade’s trenches south of Bakhmut, we could often hear the fighting in the city, and one of Pavlo’s three companies had been dispatched to join the urban combat. Thousands of Ukrainians are thought to have died in Bakhmut, and the city has become an uninhabitable wasteland, leading some to question whether the battle has been worth its cost in lives. Various strategic rationales have been offered: more Russian soldiers are dying than Ukrainian soldiers are; a withdrawal would merely shift the carnage to another town; it is advantageous to tie up Russian forces until the new Ukrainian brigades can launch their spring offensive.
>
>…
>
>“The infantry hasn’t changed since the First World War,” Oper said. “Weapons, communications, and logistics have changed, but our job is the same.” Another thing that hasn’t changed is the expectation that infantrymen will do their job without necessarily understanding why. When it’s unclear how they figure into the broader strategic calculus—and whether they are being sacrificed carelessly, as Odesa had come to feel about his friends in Kherson—infantrymen fight to save one another. The campaign to win a war can then resemble a struggle to survive it.

Russia has a very good propaganda apparatus. However, all propaganda can do is cover up the truth.

The real state of Russias forces is staring us in the face.

It’s the start of summer. This is the time of year a strong invading force should be getting moving.

If Russia was strong, the talk right now would be about Russia pushing to Kyiv.

But we aren’t taking about that.

A strong invading force grinds its opponent down until it can’t hold anymore. Instead, Ukraine isn’t exhausted because most of its units have been able to rest for significant periods of time.

If Russia was strong, the Ukrainian forces would be exhausted by now.

But we aren’t talking about that either.

If Russia was strong, it would be invading Ukraine in multiple directions, including from Belgorod.

A strong invader gets themselves in a position where they have multiple options for attack, and it divides the enemies armies up and takes it apart piece by piece.

But that isn’t happening as well.

Instead, Russia has been forced to attack in a single place of Ukraines choosing.

All of Russia’s other avenues of attack in their alleged winter offensive went nowhere.

In reality, Russia’s military is weak.

Over 15 months of continuous warfare and Ukraine is only getting stronger.

Ukraine hasn’t been given any significant ground for over 6 months.

It is now Russia that looks exhausted. It is now Russia that seems to be getting pulled in multiple directions at once.

Worse still, Ukraine has also build a force of maybe 80k men armed with NATO weapons THAT THEY HAVENT EVEN USED YET.

The signs of Russia’s weakness have been staring us in the face for many months now, and it’s getting worse for them.

Russia can’t even protect its own borders now. Do they really think they can still invade Ukraine?

If Ukraine gets this right, and so far Ukraine has been getting it right, when the counteroffensive comes it will look more like a mercy killing of an already vanquished opponent.

The core benefits being that it’s an embarrassment for Russia, and likely forces Russia to move around some troops - where they’re coming from and how much this will profoundly impact the counter-offensive is unclear. 

The negatives being that it’s being used to reinforce Russia’s propaganda of Russia vs NATO (US vehicles on Russian soil) and reinforces their propaganda regarding Nazis in Ukraine (nazis attacking Russia from Ukraine, even though they’re actually Russians with claimed  connections to far-right extremists). Lastly, I’m unsure where the US vehicles were sourced from, but if they were in fact US-supplied, I can’t imagine everyone in the West is thrilled about that. With the F-16 conversions on-going, that could end up mattering. Or perhaps this isn’t an issue at all - hard to say until there’s hard confirmation they were actually US vehicles, and whether the West truly cares. 

Regardless, even though I’m fully aware of the wave of downvotes incoming, I don’t think this was as necessarily useful as some of the takes in this thread make it out to be.

This raises an very interesting question though. We know that Putin ranks Crimea above all other territories in Ukraine. After all, it is his crowning political achievement. So much so that political analysts think that there is some chance that he might resort to nuclear weapons if Ukraine is about to retake Crimea. One analyst put that chance as a 20% conditional probability. Some of these analysts favor a long game where Ukraine will retake Crimea, but after the war ends and in a timeframe of 50 years or something like that. So the interesting question is, does Putin rank Belgorod above Crimea? Is he ok with losing actual Russian territory so long as he does not lose Crimea? Or are the analysts completely wrong in that Putin will use nuclear weapons, even if actual Russian territory is lost. The side effect of this invasion is that Ukraine is essentially forcing the nuclear question on Putin early. How Putin responds might inform us as to what happens when Crimea falls.


(I personally think that 20% is a really sobering possibility to consider, however I feel that risk must at least be tested because the lousy precedent that it would set if we allow Russia to get away with Crimea this time. So I support at least making an attempt to retake Crimea, see what Putin's response will be. I also feel that Putin's rule is so secure that he can survive the fall of Crimea.)

Edit : I am not saying he will use nuclear weapons. I am saying what he does now will inform us if he has a true willingness to use or not. I doubt he actually does given that he has not dared to strike NATO logistics hub. It is just that the 20% conditional probability is really uncomfortably high for any nuclear weapons scenario, we need to find out his true willingness to clarify the odds.",1684881007.0,1684867019.0,t3_13pde7p,t3_13pde7p,,0,-6,0,-6,0,0,

It was also kinda like that, except said sabotage groups shot up a convoy with a SBU colonel sent to deal with the situation and then started torturing people while occupying some smaller towns. Eventually Ukraine went in hard with the anti-terrorist operation, but it took them over a month to get it going - and that culminated when Russia outright invaded to save their ""rebels"".

 I guess what I'm trying to say is:

1. These guys look like they're having fun - but I assure you that they'll be deadly serious to any Russian security personnel they can ambush.
2. It takes time for nations to get a force in place to try to stamp something like this out - I'm not sure why people are making fun of Russia not being able to chase them out in 24 hours.
3. The ultimate fate of whatever this is will be decided by how much support Ukraine gives to these guys.

My take is that they (RVC) think that Russia proper should maintain all regions that were historically Russian (Slavic) while allowing all other regions that have a separate cultural identity form their own state outside of Russia.

In other words they believe in shrinking Russia to borders that make cultural sense.

Hard disagree here. It's dismantling the idea that everything is fine. 

It means Russia is unable to properly protect its civilian along its own border with Ukraine. Russia being unable to react against this incursion is showing how weak the government is. I've been checking a few popular public forums of cities and there is 0 mentions of Belgorod. They're in complete denial that something is happening there.

Showing this kind of weakness could ring the alarm for separatist movement that the Russian army isn't in a position to stop them from having their free [name of republic].

> WHAT is defence in conception? The warding off a blow. What is then its characteristic sign? The state of expectancy (or of waiting for this blow). This is the sign by which we always recognise an act as of a defensive character, and by this sign alone can the defensive be distinguished from the offensive in war. But inasmuch as an absolute defence completely contradicts the idea of war, because there would then be war carried on by one side only, it follows that the defence in war can only be relative and the above distinguishing signs must therefore only be applied to the essential idea or general conception: it does not apply to all the separate acts which compose the war. A partial combat is defensive if we receive the onset, the charge of the enemy; a battle is so if we receive the attack, that is, wait for the appearance of the enemy before our position and within range of our fire; a campaign is defensive if we wait for the entry of the enemy into our theatre of war. In all these cases the sign of waiting for and warding off belongs to the general conception, without any contradiction arising with the conception of war, for it may be to our advantage to wait for the charge against our bayonets, or the attack on our position or our theatre of war. **But as we must return the enemy's blows if we are really to carry on war on our side, therefore this offensive act in defensive war takes place more or less under the general title defensive—that is to say, the offensive of which we make use falls under the conception of position or theatre of war.** **We can, therefore, in a defensive campaign fight offensively, in a defensive battle we may use some divisions for offensive purposes, and lastly, while remaining in position awaiting the enemy's onslaught, we still make use of the offensive by sending at the same time balls into the enemy's ranks. The defensive form in war is therefore no mere shield but a shield formed of blows delivered with skill.**",False,1684854904.0,t3_13pde7p,t1_jlaqcj2,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

I agree, or at least agreed until Ukraine got all this gear from the west.

But here is the thing, modern warfare is not and hasnt been since WW2 about defeating your enemy in a standup fight. In a standup fight Germany would had lost to France in WW2. Its about maneuverability, forcing your enemy to fight you in uneven scenarios by encircling them, cut down supplies, air superiority, etc.

This is how Russia has been defeated in this war. Kyiv was won by making key attacks on russian forces making their forces so weak they lost the advantadge and had to retreat. Kharkiv was a complete maneuver warfare by thunder runs. Kherson was taken by destroying russian supply lines and force Russia to burn supplies in high intensity combat to the point they just retreated from Kherson without a fight.

A standup fight gives you Bakhmut, 10 months of horrible loses to capture the destroyed remains of an at best mediocre sized city. Modern warfare gives you Kherson, a major city captured without a fight and intact.",False,1684869079.0,t3_13pde7p,t1_jlbmfo1,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

But apply the same logic to Nato states supplying ukraine weapons and letting them fight their war, and you'd be calling NATO and the US weak as the counter offensive is taking longer than reddit wants. I think the fact that Russia was beaten back by surplus weapons can put that to bed. 

It also supposes that, if indeed it is ukraine behind the incursion that it is a less favorable option than sending bodies in a meat grinder and that occupying an aggressors territory during a war is a sign of weakness. If that's the case, then we need to better define ""weakness"". 

Some of the logical extensions are demonstrably false, but in all cases are flat wrong. Ukrainians are dying to defend their home. By whatever means, if they choose to shed less blood to do so, that's their prerogative. It's a smarter fight than what their opponents are choosing.

I'm going to speculate for a minute, and may be way off.

It's possible that this was intended as a stream of raiding parties overwhelming territory, taking what they want and leaving again in order to avoid direct engagement, with the traditional taking of territory being less important than the sowing of discord and the effort to run up as much property damage as possible.

Get into a town, drive out the local security forces, destroy some stuff, grab whatever you need to keep moving, leave again after shooting some videos, rinse and repeat.

We've seen in one location that somebody raided a police station and took off in squad cars after trashing the station, in another one they traded a humvee for a BTR, a guy stole a Russian tank earlier, a nuclear facility had to be evacuated, a border post got destroyed, an FSB building was hit, etc.

 and this is generally moving too fast with too little of anything bought in, to be about seizure and defense of large swathes of territory.

.
.
.
.


If there is almost nobody left and no interest to actually hold towns, it would explain the repeated claims of towns being retaken as fast as others fall, while almost no rebel defensive actions are being reported apart from when they got Grad Struck by the river.

Equipment would also be expected to get abandoned when damaged/out of fuel/ don't understand how to service it/don't want it/ found a different toy.

Equipment is disposable, territory is treated as a speed bump and a chance to dig through the toy box, and mobility is more important than a fixed defense, due to being an outnumbered lightweight semi-mechanised raiding force, who likely didn't expect the Russian reaction to be this underwhelming or slow.

Because this is part of the front-line.

Russia may have thought it could get away with leaving some 600 km of frontline unmanned and undefended, but that doesn't change that it is invading Ukraine and left a large part of their border undefended.

There shouldn't *need* to be getting a force in place to stamp this out, they should've had a frontline and troops in place that this doesn't happen.

So any hour that they don't respond implies an hour longer that Ukraine could've used to take more russian ground if they wished so. a 24 hour+ response time means presumably Ukraine could've driven a few tanks to Moscow without being stopped.

Of course that would be ridiculous, but no less ridiculous than a border in the frontline being manned so badly that this incursion is not being prevented or stopped right away.",False,1684850925.0,t3_13pde7p,t1_jlagpsm,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

And B) the reason I use the Kuril analogy is that when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in on April 2nd 1982 (8,000 miles from the UK) the UK stood up the resources and logistics (having been totally unprepared for war - having to draft in cruise ships for troop transport) and launched an amphibious taskforce and accompanying fleet on April 5th and had retaken South Georgia by the end of the month.

The border between Russia and Ukraine is massive but up to now Russia has not been manning it the way you would a line of contact, they have simply been trusting that NATO won’t let Ukraine invade Russia proper. By breaking that taboo, Ukraine puts Moscow in an impossible dilemma:

In order to prevent these incursions, they need to man a loooong stretch of border, and man it well: If they man it weekly, they are inviting Ukraine to break through and encircle chunks of Russian army for free. How many men would it take to man the whole border strongly? I don’t know but to make an informed guess I’d say at least 75k. Russia’s highly attritional offensive approach has left them without that kind of manpower to spare. They are worried about their lines in Ukraine and have effectively no reserve left. At this point any men needed will have to come from somewhere on the line.

So it’s clear Russia does not have the manpower to properly defend their border with Ukraine. So can they just ignore it? Let the Russian Freedom Legion claim a few towns, let Ukraine make a few raids here and there, they don’t have the manpower to really hold significant Russian soil, so don’t report on it in Russian media, what’s the harm?

Well first of all it is devastating to the illusion of strength of the regime. All those people fleeing Belgorod? They’re going to stay with friends and relatives elsewhere in Russia, so have fun not reporting it; word is going to get out. Every region with an inkling of separatist tendencies will be licking their lips when they hear Russia can’t repel an incursion of 50 guys in humvees, within 200 miles of the front.  But worse, if you make clear that you’re not moving to defend the border, you are inviting a real incursion to sweep south from Belgorod and take the Russian lines in Luhansk from the rear. Russian defensive fortifications in Ukraine are useless if you don’t anchor them on the flank. And currently the northern end of the lines in Luhansk is anchored to nothing but a line on a map, and the trust that Ukraine won’t be brazen enough to invade Russian soil. 

So Moscow can’t ignore these incursions, but they also don’t have the manpower to treat the whole border as a defensive line. There is no good solution, which is why this little diversion is actually a massively significant move.",False,1684851997.0,t3_13pde7p,t1_jlahj5y,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

Agreed. Given that Ukraine invasion into Russia now has already happened the reputational damage has already occured. Just that I have cannot really shake off at least some lingering doubts as I am not Putin. I cannot really see inside his thought process now because continuing the war is a stupid decision yet here we are. I get it that continuing the war means he has not lost yet and he believes that time is on his side, but it baffles me as to why he would think that if he is completely rational. A completely rational decision would be to cut losses and go home, because that way he would have more of his security forces intact to deal with the aftermath rather than being completely gutted and leaving him with nothing if an uprising occurs. I can only surmise he is not completely rational right now, his ego is getting in the way.

Nevertheless, it does seem highly unlikely he will use nukes if he is willing to tolerate an actual invasion. If he truly was willing to risk nuclear confrontation he would have shot at NATO logistics hubs already.",False,1684870929.0,t3_13pde7p,t1_jlbtp0d,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

Putin clearly does think that. Why do you think he tried to avoid conscripting soldiers from Moscow until he had to? Besides, Crimea is really is his crowning political achievement because he keeps talking about it. Even he cleary holds Crimea as very important.

>So now that Russia has been invaded and Putin has done nothing, Russia’s nuclear deterrent isn’t a total joke after-all!

You completely misread what I am saying. Reading too much into what I am saying. I did not say he will use nuclear weapons. What I am saying is how he responds will show us his willingness to use nuclear weapons. It is a long text but read carefully. I did explicitly write this, it is the last line of the 2nd paragraph. Besides, Russia is still probably in crisis mode, it has been only a day at this point. Wait a bit longer for a more coherent response.

I used to think that too, until one sees the kind of mass Russian casulties figures coming out and realise the Russian apetite for losses are far higher than what the West is used to. A more stable Russia is actually good for Ukraine, that means Ukraine can retake Crimea without worrying about the nuclear scenario. I suspect Putin might just have enough internal power to crush any dissent, just like what we saw with the huge anti war protests at the start.

I sure hope so. There has been brave Soviet officers who refused such orders after all.

Ironically the most effective use of nuclear weapons in the Crimean scenario might be to actually use it before any Ukraine attempt to retake it takes place. Because once Ukraine makes it onto the peninsula it will be too late to stop it. The prestige damage to Putin has already occured.

Edit: Responding to your edit, yeah, territory taken is not yet significant, not enough to force it yet. We will see how Putin responds the longer this goes on and if more Russian territory is lost.

The statement was so perfectly timed that I suspect it was coordinated.

Here's exactly what Miller said:

>And then with respect to the broader policy question, we have made very clear to the Ukrainians that we don’t enable or encourage attacks outside Ukrainians’ borders, but I do think it’s important to take a step back and remind everyone, and remind the world, that it – of course it is Russia that launched this war.  It’s Russia that continues to launch attacks on civilians in Ukraine.  It’s Russia that’s targeted schools and hospitals and civilian infrastructure.  So, it is up to Ukraine to decide how they want to conduct their military operations, but it is Russia that has been the aggressor in this war.

If Putin views Crimea as a matter of life or death, then I'm a little concerned he would escalate, but not when Crimea is about fall. Instead, Im concerned he would consider escalation before an offensive into Crimea ever begins.

If Ukraine could pull off an incredibly difficult crossing of the Dnipro River, then they could threaten Crimea relatively soon. I'm still not sure Putin gets accurate information about the war. This river crossing is extremely unlikely, but is something that could potentially surprise Putin. I think part of the reason we see incursions into Russia, and some of the other recent developments are to test Putin's reaction ahead of an offensive, just in case the Russian army really collapses somewhere. 

I don't think Putin will turn to nuclear weapons. Chemical weapons or attacks on nuclear power plants would risk direct NATO involvement. Russian propaganda has been portraying this as a conflict against NATO already. Maybe Putin can lose Crimea, and think it can be blamed on NATO support for Ukraine. I just hope there is not a scenario where Putin wants to see his forces in Ukraine wiped out by NATO directly for propaganda purposes.

Konfederacja is not a serious party - it's a coalition of several fringe right-wing parties that hate each other and work together only because they hate everyone else more.

The program that already exists in other countries; in Poland it did not result in people having more kids (the opposite actually, due to the new abortion law).

 or bring in enough manpower, 

suggests that the Russian Rebels weren't planning on staying in one place for longer than five minutes, and are instead planning on bouncing around the countryside like me when I'm on the wrong meds, with about the same amount of destruction.

.
.
.
.
.

Which is why I'm treating this like a stunt and a quick raid that got way way way out of hand, with the goals of:

 taking PR away from Bakhmut,

Sticking it to Putin,

Forcing Russian military back home,

Sabotaging the Invasion of Ukraine,

Drawing attention to organisations involved,


And forcing a Moscow reaction that if too passive shows destabilizing weakness, and if too aggressive forces Belgorod populace to pick a side, between obedience and Resistance.

.
.
.
.

Even the act of standing against the Kremlin like this will enrage them into making mistakes, and will send a message that Putin's regime is slipping.

What I'm getting at is that the UK, 40 years ago, was able to:

1. (Against a surprise attack by an initial force of around 500 Argentinian Marines - out of the blue, and with no precursor action), stand up an effective fighting force, while facing similar dilemmas to Russia about not wanting to de-commit the bulk of the military who were NATO troops in Germany, ironically, facing down the Warsaw Pact across the Iron Curtain. Or from the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
2. Prep and raise a fleet, with logistics for a long voyage and extremely limited supply lines, and set sail during a time where the military was relatively neglected.
3. Knowing that the enemy will have air-superiority. 
3. All in two days.

If Argentina invaded, say, the *Orkney Islands* on April 2nd 1982 the the context seems to indicate that the response would've been incredibly swift and overwhelming what far with fewer logistical concerns. For Russia to struggle to put an effective response to a territorial incursion of a known front-line in 2023 - I believe - is a damning indictment of their current capabilities. A win would be a genuine boon to their PR campaign - and yet their move so far has been to be very quiet about it. Not to mention a continued reflection that they can barely supply a modern war literally on their doorstep. Ukraine in 2014 was no effective fighting force and they've had to grow, via continued support since then - but Russia still wants to tout itself as the second best in the world today? If the US, UK, or France, or China was invaded in a similar limited way in 2023 I doubt they'd allow a similar clown-show to unfold for as long.",1684856608.0,1684856241.0,t3_13pde7p,t1_jlaodqn,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

The most they can muster in this department at the moment are small scale skirmishes and harassment raids on the frontlines along the Dnieper, but they quite literally do not have the naval power and presence to produce or support any substantial movement of troops and heavy equipment. Their vessels were scuttled early on to prevent Russian capture, and you need larger ships to defend and transport materiel into the area, as well as landing crafts to shuttle it all to shore. 

The physical equipment issue aside, amphibious landings are exceedingly difficult for even the best equipped nations with the most preparation, training, and resources. Even Russia, who does have a significant naval presence, and the equipment to do it, decided against amphibious assaults on Odessa and pulled out. It is far too risky to attempt, and the potential losses would be extreme. Both reasons are why digging trenches on the shoreline was literally just a waste of time, as it’s not going to happen.

If someone has a 40km gun (artillery) with drones and good vision, how do you fight against that? Well, first you step to 41km. Then you watch the gun. Do they move forward 1km to attack you? Do they send drones? Do they send soldiers / strike teams? Do they rush forward with tanks?

You get a lot of information hanging around 41km away from the enemy's 40km gun. From there, you make the decision to step forward to 39km (inside the range of the enemy gun), or back to 50km+ away back to safety.

This is a valid military objective, Russia clearly was under the impression that they can neglect huge portions of the border with Ukraine, and Ukraine is basically telling them No they can't. If Russia were to actually ignore the border with Ukraine, the Ukrainians could perform similar raids however with the actual logistics and numbers necessary to go much deeper, potentially threatening entire logistics hubs.

But whose family is threatened here? Russia is big, people from those villages might get more involved, but everyone else? Nope, Russia is too depoliticized, so I don't see people from Moscow enlisting to fight for the village on the border or even Belgorod itself.

IMO taking some border villages to redistribute Russian forces and potentially create DMZs gives Ukraine a lot more benefit than it gives to Russia by granting it some negligible increase in army generation in the Belgorod region.

>Russians have absolutely no reason to fight at the moment - let's not hand them one.

What are they doing in Ukraine then? Seems like they do have some reasons.

Russia isn't hiding its true power somewhere in its pocket. The only way Russia can escalate is with nukes, and if they do it, then it's over for them. They know it, we know it, they know that we know it, we know that they know that we know it.

The Russian nuclear blackmail is effective because Russia threatens nukes over literally everything. It's fucking obvious to everyone that it's a bluff, but people still fearmonger and paint Putin as a trigger-happy nuclear maniac so that nobody takes any risk. F16 won't be the red line, neither will Crimea nor Donbas, and not some skirmishes on the Russian border.
