Day 229 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a pretty bad day as everyone already knows. They started their massive missile strike at about 8am, starting from Kyiv and then firing more missiles at most other cities in the following hours. For us it was at around 10am, they fired at some critical infrastructure and then our electricity was gone for quite some time. 

At some places it was restored within 3 hours, so already at 1pm, but for us it was 10 hours, our electricity was fixed at 8pm, which is still extremely impressive. They didn’t just fix it under normal conditions, not only was it damaged by missiles, but we also had very strong rain showers the entire day, which started in the morning, and it is *still* raining. Fixing electricity under strong rain sounds horrible, but they managed to do it in record time.

It’s so funny that they wasted over 80 missiles to slightly inconvenience us for a day. Electricity is already fixed almost everywhere in the country, but Russians are acting like it was some kind of big win. I would even say that it’s a big win *for us*, and not for them. Those are 80 missiles that will never hit our armed forces now, which is who Russians are fighting against. Such blatant terrorist attacks also hurt their international standing, and it will only lead to more help for us.

They targeted civilian infrastructure and that won’t help them on the battlefield in any way. I guess they think that they need to win against civilians for some reason? But they are failing even at that, the only thing that they managed to achieve, is make us even more united, and now we also hate them even more. The fact they managed to miss a footbridge with their missiles is just a cherry on top. While their bridge, that is supposed to be invulnerable, was destroyed by 1 explosion, our *glass* bridge survived their missiles, this is just hilarious.

According to this [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-russia-missiles-chips/) article they had already launched 3600 missiles by the end of July. Let's be very conservative and call it 4000 total fired off by today October 10.

So they may only have 20% of their stocks left. And they will want to hold some in strategic reserve.  Every barrage now likely significantly reduces the future rate of fire. The worst of it was back in March - June.

Finally here's a [LINK](https://www.quora.com/How-many-cruise-missiles-does-Russia-have#&gid=1&pid=1) of RU missile types. Only 600 of the expensive Kalibr, how many do they even have left now?",False,1665388822.0,t3_y04xov,t3_y04xov,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

Russia and Belarus agreed on the deployment of a regional grouping of troops

President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko claims that the day before through unofficial channels he was ""warned about a strike on Belarus from the territory of Ukraine."" According to him, he agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the deployment of a joint regional grouping of troops.

""The formation of this group has begun. It's been going on for, I think, for two days. My order was given that we begin to form this group,"" Mr. Lukashenko said at a meeting with the military and security forces. What will be the size of the group and where it will be located is unknown.

He said that the agreement with Mr. Putin was reached at a personal meeting after the informal CIS summit in St. Petersburg. ""In connection with the aggravation on the western borders of the Union State, we agreed to deploy a regional grouping of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. This is all according to our documents. If the threat level reaches the current level, as it is now, we begin to use the Union State grouping,"" the Belarusian president said.

He claims that in Ukraine ""not just discussing, but planning strikes on the territory of Belarus."" ""Of course, Ukrainians absolutely do not need this. Well, why else should they open a second front on our southern borders, on their northern borders? Why? It's crazy from the military's point of view. But nevertheless, the process has begun,"" Alexander Lukashenko assures. He did not give any evidence of this.

Commenting on the information about possible strikes from Ukraine, the Belarusian president said: ""My answer was simple: ""Convey to the President of Ukraine and other crazy people that the Crimean bridge will seem like flowers to them if they touch at least one meter of our territory with their dirty hands,"" Mr. Lukashenko threatened.

Earlier, he repeatedly said that the Belarusian military is not involved in the military operation in Ukraine. Last week, Alexander Lukashenko said that Ukraine had pulled up to 15,000 troops to the Belarusian border. They will allegedly set up roadblocks and firing positions there. The Ministry of Defense of Belarus announced its readiness for the armed defense of the Union State. The department can attract 500 thousand conscripts.

The same could be said about Russia today. They are using precious munitions to randomly murder civilians, exactly because they have no idea what else to do and yet feel they must be seen to do something to “save face” in response to Ukraine’s very effective strike on a key logistical bottleneck. 

Of all the possible motives for taking military action, “saving face” by murdering civilians is by far the worst morally, and stupidest strategically. 

That it is the worst morally is obvious to everyone - in “just war” theory, justice in war involves attempting to achieve legitimate military aims with the least number of innocent casualties; here, Russia’s aim is to inflict maximum casualties, and there is no military aim whatsoever outside of terrorism, and that for domestic consumption; again, Russia must know by now terror bombing will not break Ukraine’s will to fight (rather the opposite). The whole point is to demonstrate to the Russian people the government is still potent. 

It is also dumb strategically. These munitions are not cheap and obviously could better be used for actual military purposes - hitting Ukrainian command posts, bridges, and other significant military targets; that they are not used in this manner basically advertises Russian military impotence, rather than power - they are not used in this manner, one presumes, because the Russians lack the ability.",False,1665408819.0,t3_y04xov,t3_y04xov,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

I seriously cannot see what advantage today's strikes give Russia. They achieve little military value. In terms of Ukrainian morale they will galvanize not break the people. In terms of Russian military supplies they deplete irreplaceable stockpiles. It's not clear what they achieve other than widespread condemnation. Maybe it's as petty a Putin order as ""you hit our bridge, reminder we can hit you"".

If so, I expect the response to be massive and potentially even a watershed moment in which China finally turns on Russia.

Outcomes I'd want to see, after today:

1. NATO and China publicly state that Russian aircraft launching weapons on Ukraine are valid targets, indefinitely. That includes, explicitly, whilst in Russian airspace and on the ground at Russian airfields. No running home like the days of MiG Alley.

2. Further to that, any armed Russian aircraft outside of Russian airspace will be downed without warning, on sight. Potentially extended to military aircraft capable of launching standoff weapons within Russia flying courses that threaten NATO.

3. NATO announces new AA and aircraft for Ukraine. Ideally Patriot and F-16s, ASAP. Poland to maintain if required.

4. ATACMS. Leopards. Abrams. Anything Ukraine asks for, as soon as they ask for it.

The Russians did dare to formulate their own opinions, but always with the follow-up: ""There's nothing I can do about it, we have nothing to say.""

The generally cowardly attitude, the withdrawal from everyday political life, the daily struggle to organize everyday life, the tradition of being a subject, all this leads to a cowardly passivity, to the extinction of an effective expression of opinion.

There may be one or two percent of Russians who act differently, but it is not a significant minority. Nothing will change because of this minority.

Now the military, poorly organized and severely weakened by pervasive corruption, has lost the war so far; they can't stand up to the Ukrainian military. So they are targeting the civilians more and more, want to create a wave of refugees that will keep the Europeans from the West from supporting Ukraine. Putin has also installed a criminal hardliner as commander-in-chief for this purpose.

In this way, he hopes to channel resistance in his own realms and perhaps still achieve success on the military front.

Unfortunately, this can work if we, the West, make it easy for ourselves and deal with the consequences that this will have, refugee flows, energy costs, potential energy shortages, and so on. Food shortage and so on, along with electing the wrong parties instead of significantly expanding our support for Ukraine.

We do not have to impose any restrictions on ourselves and the Ukrainians with regard to the range of the weapons we supply; military targets in Russia should also be able to be attacked with the weapons we supply.

Better today than tomorrow we should deliver fighter planes and modern tanks.

Belarus is on the sidelines:  By launching terror attacks from Belarus Russia hopes to provoke Ukrainian strikes in Belarus.  That would make it more difficult for Belarus to continue to avoid direct involvement.   

China is on the sidelines:  if the US declared Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, that would make the US sanction Russia’s trade partners including China.   That would create friction that would potentially prompt pressure for a rapid resolution of the conflict.

""Do not count on a large number of troops of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. But it will be more than 1,000 people,"" the website Zerkalo quoted Lukashenko as saying.

Lukashenko, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, said the two countries started pulling forces together two days ago, apparently after the explosion on Russia's bridge to Crimea, state news agency Belta reported.

But he does not say where the troops will be deployed.

Lukashenko also claimed that Ukraine was preparing an attack on his country's territory.

""I've said already that today Ukraine is not just discussing but planning strikes on the territory of Belarus,"" Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying.

""My answer was simple: 'Tell the Ukrainian president and other madmen that the Crimea bridge will seem like a walk in the park if they touch even a metre of our territory with their dirty hands.'""

He should know, but the idea of using thermite and it coming in from Russia... well, can't rule it out.  But it's much too soon to rule out a fuel oil plus fertilizer bomb.

The whole thing would be managed as a DAO, where the crypto you donate would give you a say in the organization's administration.

It would be a way for Ukraine to get the money from the sale of Russian assets as well as profiting off of the assets, ensuring a long term income stream for Ukraine.

A project called Constitution DAO raised $47M in a few days through a DAO to buy a copy of the US Constitution. Why can't we do the same?

Currently people see the UN is useless and it is, mostly, but it leaves open a way for countries to talk. It might not achieve anything 99% of the time but with all of that waste the 1% is good.

The reason why I say it would end the UN like it is currently is because of China. If Russia was removed from the SC then China would no longer have anyone to side with them in the SC. If some country brought up a dispute in the SC against china then China would be forced to abstain from the vote and there would be no veto possible from China. The SC's veto isn't like the veto in some countries, the veto in the SC is because the permanent members are required to vote in favor of something or it is rejected. Except UN rules require the country that the dispute is brought against to abstain from the vote so China would lose their veto power.

If China would no longer have a secured veto because of Russia's support then China would no longer have a reason to be in the UN. By removing Russia then China would be gone as well. The countries that support Russia and China would no longer have a reason to be in the UN. Then the UN would just become a group of countries that already get along.

The Guardian spent as much time editorializing and talking about Fox News' reaction than just quoting Kirby.

>“The president was reflecting the very high stakes that are in play right now, Martha,” Kirty told host Martha Raddatz during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.”

> “When you have modern nuclear power and the leader of that modern nuclear power willing to use irresponsible rhetoric the way that Mr. Putin has several times in just the last week or two, as well as the high tension in Ukraine over just the course of the last few days,” he added. “So the president, I think, was accurately reflecting the fact that the stakes are very high right now.”

>Kirby stressed that Biden’s comments last week were not based on any new intelligence, asserting that the U.S. doesn’t have any indication that Putin “has made that kind of decision.”

>Kirby on Sunday said that the U.S. has not “seen anything that would give us pause to reconsider our own strategic nuclear posture.”

>“What the president was reflecting was that stakes are high right now, given what’s going on on the battlefield in Ukraine and given the very irresponsible and reckless comments made by Vladimir Putin in just the last few days,” he reiterated.

 >The Zagreb rocket attacks were a series of two rocket attacks conducted by the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina that used multiple rocket launchers to strike the Croatian capital of Zagreb during the  Croatian War of Independence. The attack killed seven and wounded over 200 Croatian civilians and was carried out on 2 May and 3 May 1995 as retaliation for the Croatian army's offensive in Operation Flash. The rocket attacks deliberately targeted civilian locations. Zagreb was the largest of several cities hit by the attack.

* Russia thinks it was betrayed and sold by the west when the USSR fell. Russian 90s were bad, like bad bad. It’s not entirely wrong when people say that Russia was abandoned post-USSR collapse, because in some ways, Russia probably would have needed a lot of picking up and handholding. What happened instead was that its assets and valuables were sold off for cents to oligarchs, whilst the general population either fled the country, was starving and living without pay checks, food or electricity occasionally, or resulted to criminal means. That doesn’t mean that the west IS at fault, though. It just means that Russia would’ve probably needed some more handholding than was given to them.

* at the same time, Russians believe that the USSR collapse was a stab in the back by the former states that managed to transition successfully to democratic states. The wide belief is that russia provided these countries factories and jobs and means of production and built houses etc., only for those countries to betray russia and leave. In reality, of course, Soviet Union (in which Moscow and Russia were the main honchos deciding everything) bombed our countries to bits alongside Nazis and whatever was left was then demolished and rebuilt in grand Soviet style. Russians and Russia like the myth that there was nothing here before they, nothing but uneducated masses of people and peasantry. In reality, the average person in the Baltics was probably more educated and literate and rich than the average Russian (excluding those living in St Petersburg or Moscow, of course). 

* Russia feels that it is being surrounded by NATO/EU. This is of course BS because if you look at a map, then NATO/EU countries borders cover only a fraction of Russian border. 

* Russia thinks of itself as one of the “greats”. Historically, what are the countries in Europe with long histories, that intertwine with the history of Europe? Most likely: France, UK, Spain, Netherlands etc. For this comparison, I choose France. France has a long history and French culture has, at one point or another, influenced many areas of life in Europe. No matter what one thinks of france today, one cannot argue that France hasn’t paid a big role in European development. Russians see Russia basically like France - one of the greats. To borrow a little, the  “great” countries in Europe are a bit like old and respected people. For the sake of the argument, let’s say that France can count its influence in cuisine, art, history, diplomacy, language (eg the official language in many places well into the 19th century, eg like royal courts etc.). Russia basically sees itself as the same thing, but in the east. It sees itself as a country of great history, great influence, great art and literature and music etc. To be not seen as one is an insult. Russia thinks that many Europeans and European countries don’t consider Russia with the respect it deserves (in their view)  - people don’t think “Russia - the France in East Europe”. That’s also one of the reasons why people freaked out so much about the visas - the visas and ability to travel to Europe equals, in their mind, with the important status of Russia and Russians. To revoke it it’s like telling them that they’re kind of like… Turks? (No offence to Turkish people - I meant that Russians see themselves as equally important as French, aka deserving of the same treatment as French people have). 

* also, accepting former Soviet states into EU/NATO is an insult to Russia because supposedly at one point someone promised that this would never happen. That promise never existed, at least not on paper. 

* Russia also considers Ukraine proper as basically Russian. Russia tracts its history from Kievan Rus (which was there long before Moscow was even a thing, AFAIK). Kievan Rus used to be in Ukrainian territory. For Putin, who is big on all kinds of symbolism and allegory, the roots of Russian state cannot exist outside of Russia and certainly not in Ukraine, which many Russians see neither as a country nor a nation. For the average Russian, Ukrainians are Russians who speak broken Russian and should be taught how to speak proper Russian. They don’t recognise that Ukrainian national entity or language stands separately from Russian one. Ukraine as a state was pretty closely tied to Russia prior to 2014, but since Crimea, it’s moved further and further away. For years, Putin has told people how badly Ukrainians live - how bad their economy is and how poor they are and how great a life in Russia is. Russia couldn’t afford Ukraine to become visibly more well off, let some get ever closer to EU, because it would shatter the myth that Ukraine is a piss-poor back alley off Russia and would in turn make Russian people ask why are they living like they do if Russia is so much richer and better than Ukraine. 

* and why are Russians okay with it? Because Putin has fed them a steady diet how everybody hates Russia because of how great it is. How everybody hates Russia because Russia won against the Nazis and how Europe is growing Nazi hate against Russia again. To Russians, being anti-Russia = nazi. They’re fine with Ukrainians being killed because they don’t see Ukrainians as people deserving their own language or nation, basically as jumped up little Russians who have forgotten their place at the feet of true Russians and need to be punished and reminded of their true place in the totem pole.",False,1665436265.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irsv4ht,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,y04xov,irsyuzg,"It's the age old story of humanity: authoritarianism and tribalism. You take a group of people for who things are not going to great and therefore perceive their social status to be lower than they are happy with and present them with a Great Leader on the one hand and a Great Enemy on the other. The Great Leader is imbued with all good qualities of the ""in group"", he is Strong, Wise, Intelligent - all these things. By being part of the ""in group"" you get to feel as if all these Great Qualities are now also yours, you feel ""strong"" by mere participation, you don't even have to do anything. 

Similarly, the Enemy gives great focus. They are the ""other"", they are ""danger"", they are the cause of everything (so says the Great Leader) and must be defeated. All your woes are not your fault, but the fault of the Enemy. What a convenient state of affairs: just as your life as shitty, you got to feel great about yourself AND blame someone else. Man that's fantastic.

Essentially, this is more or less how cults of authority work. Nationalism is an easy way in, because everybody has a nationality and it already has the inbuilt tribalism aspect of Us vs Them. But it can be anything, in the US it's radicalized Republicans who see the Democrats as the enemy, but simple football hooligans exhibit the same tribalistic qualities. Pick any type of identity and we're just programmed to think ""us"" and ""them"". Add some authoritarianism to it through a Great Leader, and you basically get to do whatever the hell you want.

The Russia people definitely felt as if they got the short end of the stick. The used to be part of the USSR, a world power, and now they are just a backwater, nobody cares about them, they're a gas station with nukes. It's a matter of wounded pride and bruised ego, made worse by the bad economic conditions in the 90's. Putin oversaw a great economic growth and a form of restoration of the Russian national pride, that certainly gave him a lot of credit in the eyes of many. 

As for the war, that feeds on the same Russian pride. In their view, Russia is on top. They are the ""big brother"" and Ukraine is the ""little brother"". So when the little brother doesn't behave, it's their right and duty to admonish them. When the little brother starts *beating* them, that is an **enormous** upset. Such an event radically clashes with their self-image, it is an absolute *humiliation* to them, having to be bested by Ukraine. So that's when it comes to brutality like we have seen, some Russians are OK with it, and even revel in it. Because cutting off someones balls, or anally raping them, or just regular raping them, torturing them, throwing missiles at whatever you please, to *hurt* the other, to make them feel ""scared and small"" is the whole point. It's in their eyes a restoration of the natural of order, they are displays of dominance meant to confirm their place on the top.

In such a case, that is *so* important, that everything else stops mattering as it activates some pretty deep instincts of ""kill or be killed"" that override just about anything else. The core guiding principle of their motivation is that THEY are the dominant one. And if civilians or children die, that's not *their* fault, it's the Ukrainians fault for not submitting. If only they ""knew their place"" then this would not have been necessary - is the logic.

It all goes very deep to the uglier side of our nature. It's very simply a matter of ""who is the boss"", filtered through many layers of culture, language, history and civilization. But ultimately it's just that very base instinct that has been carefully evoked by Putin in his population.",1665433288.0,1665433076.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irsv4ht,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

To understand why there have been harsh hostilities between the two you have to look at Euromaiden. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan)

Euromaidan light the fuse to a bomb Russia has been building for years. TLDR version of it is Ukraine citizens wanted closer relations with the EU while the then Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych (a known Russian sympathizer) rejected it. The result was originally a mass peaceful protest that the opposition escalated. Up to this point, Russia has actively been corrupting Ukrainian politics, imprisoning political opponents, and typical KGB shit. This sparked the first war between Russia and Ukraine. 

The result of that war - Russia annexed Crimea, Russia destabilized the east bordering oblasts (Donetsk and Luhansk), and Ukraine shifting their Constitution to align itself more with the west. 

Between that point and today there has been fighting amongst Donetsk/Luhansk separatists and Ukraine. It was sporadic for the most part, but frequent. 

Over the years since 2014 the prospect of joining NATO started becoming popular with some polls cresting 50% public interest. Russia's global enemy is, obviously, NATO. They want to formally annex Donetsk and Luhansk. If they do so after Ukraine were to join NATO then it's a guaranteed WW3. So they have to do it much sooner. 

 
All that doesn't necessarily answer 'Why?' though. That has more to do with Putin directly. Putin has a very extreme point of view in regards to Russia. In his own writing he called the Fall of the USSR as the greatest tragedy to happen in the 20th century. (Nevermind the fact that the 20th century was a host of numerous atrocities including both world wars and mass genocides...). To him, Russia's border should go back to East Germany. 

Then there's Ukraine-Russia history. The roots of modern day Moscow go back to Kyiv. Many people that have lived in both cities for generation have loose connections to each other at this point. Ukraine and Russia are practically brothers in terms of history. And when Ukraine is suddenly deciding to not play by Moscow's rules to instead go play with United States/NATO - Putin isn't having any of that. 

The significance of the war can't be understated though. It can have some very dramatic results if it ever comes to an end. **Currently** the two options are Russia annexes the country and remains closed off from the rest of the world (Cold War 2), or Russia undergoes a regime change.

Additionally, both after mobilization and this morning they have put out statements asking for de-escalation. It also seems likely, but we have no direct confirmation of this, that they have warned Russia privately about the use of nuclear weapons. 

All in all, China is totally fine with Russia conquering Ukraine, but they are not fine with an elongated conflict that is disturbing global supply lines, driving up energy prices, creates further instability due to food shortages and lack of Russian soft power, and on top of that risks (nuclear) escalation between Russia and NATO.",False,1665411739.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irrh7pq,,1,25,0,25,0,0,

- Putin is listening to the pro-extremist requests (mobilize, attack civilians, be more ruthless, force Belarus to get involved, etc) so it's unlikely he will get a coup from them. And the oligarchs seem quite powerless. So for now no transition in Russia sadly.
- More suffering throughout Europe and the world due to lack of oil/gas/fertilizer/food/etc, which might mean more extremist governments arising.

If I had to guess, I'd say slow and steady progress in the Luhansk and Kherson regions.  They'll probably take Svatove, Troitske, and maybe even Starobilsk before the end of the year, but probably not Sievierdonetsk/Lysychansk.  I could see them re-taking everything in the Kherson region west of the Dneiper River.

That's a reasonable assessment.

What we don't know, however, is how many mobilized soldiers will be thrown into the conflict?  Where?  How effective will they be?  Will Belarus enter the war?  How many soldiers are being dragged away from the offensive in order to defend the North against a possible front being opened up there by the Belorussian Army?  Those factors could slow progress considerably.

Then again, depending the difficulty in Russia to resupply its troops after the attack on the Kerch bridge, the perceived dwindling of supplies Russia has, and how poorly prepared Russian troops are for the oncoming winter, maybe that speeds the offensive up, or opens up new lines of attack for the Ukrainians.

I am no military expert but here are my thoughts on how I think the near future of the way will go.

In the south and east , Ukraine will continue to make steady gains for the next couple of month. The liberation however, will be slowed due to a couple of factors.

1) Winter will slow the speed of the conflict.

2) Russian mobilization will have some effect. It won't turn the tide in Russia's favor but it might provide enough meat shields to give Russia a chance to dig in and fortify.

3) The reopening of the northern front. (more on this in a bit)

Out side of the current front, I believe that Putin will use his bolstered forces to launch a second invasion from the north. Thru Russia proper and Belarus. 

I do not think this new front will go well for Russia, and will have many of the issue the first northern front had. Only worse, due to lack of equipment and training among his now drafted army. 

This front will however, force Ukraine to divert forces and slow the liberation of the East and South.

On the other fronts. I predict that at some point Belarus will be formerly placed under Russian occupation. I also predict that Putin will continue to bomb civilian targets in Ukraines cities.

In the long run. I think Ukraine will win this war. However, Ukrainian V-day is still sadly quite a long ways off.

Probably:  Long attritional period during which few gains are made by either side.  

By early 2023 Europe will have completely replaced its dependency on Russia.  Russia's GNP will be projected at 50% its 2022 numbers.  Russian birthrate at all-time low.  Many oligarchs' accounts will be tapped out having been forced to donate to the war effort.  Command of the war effort will change hands again.  Russia will lose Iran and North Korea as sources of new equipment.  Ukraine will stall in Luhansk around the Oskil border, south Donbas will stall as Wagner is redistributed, Kherson bridgehead will continue to shrink to two bridgeheads around the city and the dam.  Russia attempts to re-open a front in the Chernihiv region and gets repelled, but the border will look like it did north of Kharkiv for several months.  Eventually Russia retreats from Kherson city (70% of oblast still occupied) but keeps the dam intact because they still think they're winning.  Ukraine unable to continue counteroffensives until April or May.  And hey, I hope I'm very wrong, and it's possible the Ukrainian troops trained abroad will be able to make a difference around end December, but this isn't the worst-case scenario.  And the winter doesn't matter.  Russians will run their cars at night and kick people out of their houses; there's too many of them for exposure to make a difference since few offensives will be completed by anybody.  Climate-appropriate attire matters more in close-combat, not artillery battles.  

Possibly:  Several potentially-destabilizing scenarios create heightened tensions in Europe.  

One is Turkey invading Syria with increased impunity collapsing the Assad government, endangering the Kurds, and relieving pressure from the remaining ISIS strongholds, all of which pisses off NATO potentially to the point Turkey is lost as a Ukrainian allly and NATO members have to pick up the slack.  

Another one is the vandalism or destruction of the Russian embassy in Poland.  To be honest I don't know how it hasn't been burned down yet, but I'm sure Polish security is taking a lot of headache medication.  Likeliest response to that is Russia deliberately starts targeting embassies in Kyiv and Moscow, which isn't the end of the world but forces NATO into some sort of response; and a response that's too weak could be quite really pretty shitty.  

Also having no logical reason to expect it aside from the pattern of Russia conducting spec-ops that hurt it more than it hurts Ukraine, they may damage the dam in Kherson on their way out which will cause flooding up to and including the city, and it will be some time before lines of control reform.  It won't change much but it goes under the possible rather than probable.  

The good:  Since Russia cannot produce more guided ordinance on their own, there is really no reason they should still have anything like that to fire before the first half of 2023 is over.  They will be in their second or third mobilization phase by then and for the first time a majority of Russians will prefer a ceasefire.  If Ukraine doesn't defeat them outright before May-June, they will at least again be in a position to retake territory and force a general withdrawal.  

So my worst-case scenario is this time next year the war is over and Ukraine wins, but there's a big toll on Ukraine (they may need to resort to a draft), and on European diplomacy in several regions.  I know we're all just hoping it happens sooner, and sure as hell don't quote me on it.",False,1665460425.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irugzn8,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Well, probably some legal objections from people who would be negatively affected by it. 

The embargo of Cuba was explicitly created to cause hunger, deprivation, and discontent that would lead to the downfall of Castro's government. That is, as of today, not the official US policy toward Russia. The policy is an end to the conflict via sanctions against doing business with Russian individuals and entities that are supporting the war effort in Ukraine - either materially, financially, or politically. Without designating Russia as a state sponsor of terror, or declaring war, or some other justification, a ban probably wouldn't stand up in court. 

E.g. imagine a small business in South Carolina sells gourmet dog food to a Russian supermarket chain, and it represents 30% of their annual revenue. If tomorrow Biden signed an executive order saying ""no more doing business with Russia whatsoever"", that company's owner would grab a lawyer, march into a federal courthouse, and sue to compel the government to explain its rationale for denying them the right ply their trade, since a 30% cut in revenue would probably ruin them. If the supermarket isn't a sanctioned entity, its owners not on the sanctions list, and dog food having no discernible value to Russia's war effort, the onus is on the government to convince the court that it's necessary to execute an official US government policy.",False,1665422667.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irs379d,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

Israel has been reluctant to give any advanced weapons systems to Ukraine, because they have their own Russian problem: Syria is a Russian puppet state, right on Israel’s border, and one at which Israel has been at war for years. To date, the Russians haven’t used this base to attack Israel, but they constantly threaten that this is a possibility. Given Israel is a tiny nation (total population something like nine million), they feel they can’t stand up to Russia. 

More specifically, Syria is used as a logistics hub by Hezbollah to import munitions from Iran, and Russia looks the other way when Israel targets this. 

Or at least, that used to be the case. Now that Russia appears to be more of a paper tiger, and pulling resources out of Syria, things may be changing. 

For example, just last month, Israel was allowing its military manufacturers to sell advanced anti-drone technology  ostensibly to Poland, but in actuality to Ukraine:

Sometimes the best solutions end up being more costly. It is better to have empowered Ukraine, than to have quickly stepped in on their behalf. 
The months that have passed have seen major transformations to the Ukrainian military as well as Zelenskyy himself. Sure, the military had assistance, but they did this with no foreign boots on the ground. Many of the systems that were delivered required time consuming training. The pride and confidence that Ukraine has acquired has gotten them through much of this war. It will still be there long after the war has ended.

I suppose an argument could be made that if the HIMARS were delivered sooner, this could have changed things. On the other hand, Russian atrocities and lies serve as a clear justification allowing the US to have delivered HIMARS. In addition, I'm not so sure that the rest of the world would have stepped in with assistance if the US alone ""decided to go all out"" in the first month. It took time for some countries to come on board regarding military assistance. In addition, time has also allowed the West to become ""unified"" through consensus.

On April 26, 1937, Guernica was bombed by  Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe, in one of the first aerial bombings. The attack inspired Pablo Picasso's painting Guernica, depicting his outrage at the attack.

The thing is, all our production is generally pretty slow without significant returns to scale, except for things like small arms ammo.

It makes a lot of sense: we have a lot of peacetime years to build stocks over, and capacity is expensive.

But, IMO, we need to identify some key systems and really tool up manufacturing-- incur some capital costs to permanently increase production (GMLRS rockets? artillery shells?).  It's a powerful signal about our ongoing capability to support allies in conflict.

There's obvious areas we're undercapitalized even for peacetime.  E.g. 152mm artillery production: Ukraine shot all the allied stocks of Soviet-type-shells despite some NATO militaries still being dependent upon them.

The first is “right to go to war”, the Latin tag “jus ad bellum”. That is what you are talking about: war in a good cause. Obviously, defending your country against a wholly unjustified attack qualifies, while invading your neigbours to take their land does not (Ukraine and Russia practically being paradigm cases here). 

The other aspect is “right conduct in war”, or in Latin, “jus in bello”. This deals with how one fights a war - basically, achieving reasonable military objectives while minimizing casualties, particularly minimizing civilian casualties (which of course can never be wholly avoided, war being what it is). *Jus in bello* deals with maintaining a distinction between civilians and military; proportional attacks on legitimate military objectives; and military necessity. 

An “unjust war” can be fought “justly” and vice versa, although usually the two go together - as they do here. 

To give concrete examples, attacking a bridge that is your enemy’s logistical lifeline is “just” - it is a legitimate military target of high value to the conduct of the war. Some civilians will be killed, those travelling on the bridge at the time, but the actual number is small in proportion to the legitimate military aims (cutting your enemy off from supplies). 

In contrast, randomly bombarding Ukrainian cities is unjust conduct in war. There is no legitimate military objective, killing civilians (presumably to spread terror, but more immediately, to impress the Russian public that Russia is still potent) is the whole point.

I’m American but have ties in central Europe and lived in Prague when I was younger and was always curious about some of the animosity from Czechs towards Russians, aside from the obvious 1968/USSR events. I asked a Czech girl once about it and she basically said it was because Russians who can live in CZ/EU basically just think they’re better than everyone else. At the time I thought it was a simplified generalization but growing older witnessing the war in 2022 I realize more what she meant. 

Russians consider themselves “rulers of the Slavs” and feel like they have to protect other Slavic peoples from the “big bad West”.

There are persistent rumours that a lot of the old systems fail to make it much further than their launch platform before failing.

In late May the US estimated 1200 had been fired at Ukraine, Ukraine figures were just over 2000.

Throwing ~100 a day, like today, certainly causes a lot of disruption, but it will empty Russia's reserves within a couple of weeks, leaving them only able to fire 1 or 2 a week based on their production rates.

What that means is under each track there are two large girders parallel to the tracks linked to one and other by x cross braces, probably about every 2-3m. So four girders between each pier. They form a box like area under the deck. I’m guessing the deck is concrete. That’s actually bad news because a concrete deck on a box bridge doesn’t do much. They could have actually set the ties straight on the boxes, which means the concrete is mostly there to fill with ballast (stones) to keep the ties (sleepers) from moving about. 

All in all, the possibility exists on the rail bridge that the damage may not be particularly significant. Furthermore if the highway spans were precast concrete sections, those might not be particularly difficult to replace.

The more deformation you get, the less work those flanges can do until you get a cascading failure.

So you either stiffen the hell out of the flanges, or you simply construct your beam as a rectangle instead of a standard I shape.  Hence ‘box’ beam.  

The spans were probably so large that no stock shape was going to work, so it was always going to be a built up beam.  It’s more work to put together, but they probably saved overall because fewer supports were needed.

From wiki:

UK MoD stated that Russia is possibly using anti-ship missiles, like the Kh-22, against ground targets. Such missiles “are highly inaccurate and therefore can cause severe collateral damage and casualties”.[15]

On 9 May 2022, 13 Kh-22 missiles were reportedly fired by the Russian Air Force: seven at Fontanka, a coastal village about 15 km (9.3 mi) north of Odesa, where at least one smashed into the Riviera shopping mall around 10:35 PM (after curfew), killing one, and six at targets in the Donetsk Oblast.[16]

Between 12 May and 25 June 2022, at least 10 other Russian Kh-22 strikes in Ukraine, involving at least 44 missiles in total, were reported in the media.[16]

On 27 June 2022, two Kh-22 or Kh-32 missiles, launched by Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 bombers, were reportedly used in the Kremenchuk shopping mall attack, killing at least 21 people and injuring at least 59.[17][16] [4] One missile smashed directly into the mall while the other fell about 450 meters away, into the edge of the Kredmash Road Machinery Plant, which primarily manufactures asphalt and concrete mixers, where it injured two of the 100 employees present.[16] Both missiles might have been aimed at the same target since such distance is within the limited accuracy of Kh-22 missiles (according to the international security analyst Sebastien Roblin, ″only half of the shots land within 600 meters of the aiming point″).[16]

In the night between 30 June and 1 July 2022, three Kh-22 missiles were fired from Tu-22M3s into a 9-storey apartment building and a recreational center in Serhiivka, a Ukrainian settlement on the Black sea coast about 70 km (43 mi) south-west of Odessa. A whole section of the apartment building was destroyed. At least 21 people were killed in both strikes, including a 12 year-old boy, and more than 39 wounded, including six children.[18][19][20] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said of the attack: ""Today, the Russian army launched another brutal missile attack. A Russian missile was a supersonic anti-ship cruise missile, by the way. It hit an ordinary residential building in the Odesa region, in the village of Serhiivka. Such Kh-22 missiles were created to hit aircraft carriers and other large warships, but the Russian army used them against an ordinary nine-story building with ordinary civilians.""[21]

On 14 September 2022, it was reported at least seven Kh-22 missiles were launched at various hydraulic structures in Kryvyi Rih, including a nearby dam. This caused that the water level of the Inhulets river increased by 2–3 metres (6 ft 7 in – 9 ft 10 in), or even 5–6 metres (16–20 ft). Previously, the Inhulets became too shallow, allowing the Ukrainian army to build pontoon bridges during its southern counteroffensive.[22] However, Ukrainian MoD claimed Kh-101 missiles were used during the missile strike.[23]",False,1665392218.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irqnz5a,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

The ELI6 is: When you heat steel enough, the way that it cools determines its final properties.  You can have harder/softer, stronger/weaker, ductile/brittle, whatever.  Most steels, when they are first made, are allowed to cool in open air. The metal in this bridge after the fire would have done the same.  Some steels are however ""heat treated"" a specific way by heating/cooling in a controlled manner.  If this bridge steel required a heat treatement, that treatment has been undone and it has been returned to its ""raw"" state which may be an issue for the bridge.

2 quotes from there: 

>Krasovsky published an article in The Guardian denouncing homophobia in Russia. He wrote:

> ""How did it come about that today in Russia a good gay person is a dead gay person? How did there come to be a law in the Duma that forbids justifying homosexuality? Until now, the only thing you were forbidden to justify in my country was terrorism.... So as far as the deputies are concerned I am not a human being in the same sense that they are; I am to be classed as scum, like a terrorist. As far as the deputies are concerned I am scum by the fact of my birth, and it was criminal negligence not to have made a note of that in my birth certificate. What seemed like a bad dream only a couple of years ago has now become reality. And it is terrifying to imagine what could happen tomorrow.""

Then he goes:

> In January 2022, during a televised interview at Russia Today with Alexander Baunov about recent developments in Kazakhstan, he denied the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO and warned that Russia would start an invasion to stop any such attempt, citing ""We (Russia) will make a military intervention to Ukraine. It is our land"". On being asked if it was an ultimatum, he agreed.

> In one broadcast he called Ukrainians ""animals,"" and said Ukraine ""should not exist, and we will do anything to make it disappear.

>The political term right-wing was first used during the French Revolution, when liberal deputies of the Third Estate generally sat to the left of the presiding officer's chair, a custom that began in the Estates General of 1789. The nobility, members of the Second Estate, generally sat to the right. In the successive legislative assemblies, monarchists who supported the Old Regime were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was Joseph de Maistre, who argued for an authoritarian form of conservatism.

 >Total war is a type of warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The term has been defined as ""A war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded"". In the mid-19th century, scholars identified total war as a separate class of warfare.

Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm’s way by establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including in schools and hospitals, as they repelled the Russian invasion that began in February, Amnesty International said today. 

Such tactics violate international humanitarian law and endanger civilians, as they turn civilian objects into military targets. The ensuing Russian strikes in populated areas have killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure. 

“We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 

“Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.”

Not every Russian attack documented by Amnesty International followed this pattern, however. In certain other locations in which Amnesty International concluded that Russia had committed war crimes, including in some areas of the city of Kharkiv, the organization did not find evidence of Ukrainian forces located in the civilian areas unlawfully targeted by the Russian military.

Between April and July, Amnesty International researchers spent several weeks investigating Russian strikes in the Kharkiv, Donbas and Mykolaiv regions. The organization inspected strike sites; interviewed survivors, witnesses and relatives of victims of attacks; and carried out remote-sensing and weapons analysis. 

Throughout these investigations, researchers found evidence of Ukrainian forces launching strikes from within populated residential areas as well as basing themselves in civilian buildings in 19 towns and villages in the regions. The organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab has analyzed satellite imagery to further corroborate some of these incidents.

Most residential areas where soldiers located themselves were kilometres away from front lines. Viable alternatives were available that would not endanger civilians – such as military bases or densely wooded areas nearby, or other structures further away from residential areas. In the cases it documented, Amnesty International is not aware that the Ukrainian military who located themselves in civilian structures in residential areas asked or assisted civilians to evacuate nearby buildings – a failure to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians.

The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. The handling of the crisis by Vladimir Putin, who was prime minister at the time, boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months. The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September.

This has already materialised on the battleground and Russia had to start ordering on Iranian kamakaze drones to try and replace the role of diminished precision missle stocks. Todays attack on Kiev is rare but if you remember long range missle strikes occured much more frequently at the start of the war targetting places as far as Lviv as well.

Heres an [article](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/17/explainer-is-russia-running-low-on-missiles-a77704) back in May noting how precision strikes had already reduced as a result of low stockpiles.

and

>there has been a recent uptick in Russian air sorties, with pilots conducting operations in Ukrainian airspace with unguided munitions.

Signed on 20 July 1936 at the Montreux Palace in Switzerland, it went into effect on 9 November 1936, addressing the long running Straits Question over who should control the strategically vital link between the Black and Mediterranean seas. The Montreux Convention regulates maritime traffic through the Turkish Straits. It guarantees ""complete freedom"" of passage for all civilian vessels in times of peace.

We might hurt China temporarily, but I don't think we would do any lasting damage to their opprosive regime, at least not without severely weakening the already fragile position of democracy in many western nations.

For them to get anything close to our military would take doing what the Russians couldn't do, technological improvement to match our weapons. They can do that. They have the education, the motivation in a way the Russians never did, and the industry. 

What it won't be though is cheap, or fast. What we can do now is stop paying for that. We're paying now for preparation for a third world war.

We won't be able to force change by war, that's not something any of us want, or something that is likely to work. They'll just get more determined, even part of their population that currently is, like most of the rest of us, just trying to get by day to day. 

So what works? First we need to recognise how they have power. Currently one of the key reasons, along with force and propaganda, is the idea of ""the party has brought prosperity"".  Which brings us to:

> Cut off trade? China manufactures 80% of the world's consumer goods, and nobody is in a position to replace them for years to come.

We're already seeing shifts this way, with companies leaving the country following the last US administration's trade tariffs as well as probably a bigger factor of covid, their ongoing reaction to it, and the supply chain issues that comes with that.

There's a huge amount of things that you can even now replace with products not made there (/r/avoidchineseproducts has a ton of options, everything from dental floss to cell phones).

That trend is likely to continue, and more options will open up with more incentives to move like some countries have introduced.

Most of the growth of the country's GDP is in the last ten-twelve years. If that were to be undone it would cause a huge amount of unrest. We're not anywhere near that and there have already even been localised protests about their own internal banking fraud and issues. 

It wouldn't take much to reverse their ""prosperity"" argument. They built their economy first on components for others to build products, then on finished goods. Pushing them from finished goods back to components would be a huge hit to them, and it'd stop them funding their military at the same rate for risk of USSRing themselves.

It might not fix the issue of uighurs quickly, but it's something. It makes them choose between stick and carrot. if they choose stick, we can ramp up sanctions more. 

We tried to bring them into the world of decency with trade and money, and instead they've used it for military expansion, camps, influence projects, and oppression. We need to stop funding that at the very least.",1665436234.0,1665436020.0,t3_y04xov,t1_irt41eg,,5,1,0,1,0,0,
