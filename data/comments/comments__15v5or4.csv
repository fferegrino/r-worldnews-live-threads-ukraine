From the article, it appears five experienced senior commanders of Azov that were taken prisoner are also back in action:

Trying a new thing today. Let's see if my fickle brain can stick to it. An amateur's interpretation of the ISW bullet points (yes, I've read the whole damn article. You should too.):

>The Washington Post reported on August 17 that the US intelligence community has assessed that Ukraine’s counteroffensive will fail to reach Melitopol in western Zaporizhia Oblast and will not achieve its principal objective of severing the Russian land bridge to Crimea.

This Washington Post article is far too specific about Melitipol. Taking Melitipol would imply Ukraine Kool'Aid Manned their way through Tokmak, which is a fucking feat. It's not even the primary objective. That's to sever the land bridge, which can be achieved by gaining fire control over Berdyansk.

So why was this leaked? Why did Blinken immediately refute this analysis? We don't have the answer to the those questions yet, but I feel it's safe to say the United States is flexing some soft power. My guess is we're trying to up Ukraine's tolerance for casualties so as to satisfy our domestic political concerns. To maintain support we need tangible victories, so we need Ukraine to take risks.

It's a whole hell of a lot easier to justify sending F-16s when America has something tangible to point to, casualties be damned.

>It is premature to make assessments about the overall success of ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive operations occurring along several lines of advance toward several different apparent objectives.

Godspeed, Ukraine.

>Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations on at least three sectors of the front on August 18 and have reportedly advanced further near Robotyne in western Zaporizhia Oblast.

I've heard about Robotyne for literally weeks. It's becoming our Bakhmut, but that's only because Russia is defending it like hell. Remember, they didn't let Uro-whatever-it's-called go until the soldiers straight-up broke.

Why? Why is Russia refusing to yield ground? We saw in Severodonetsk and Lyschansk how a fighting retreat is supposed to be fought, so if the 'Second Line of Defense' is so fucking strong, why isn't Russia using it? Why hold ground at all cost?

Is it because Putin is afraid that if he orders a retreat everyone will join in?

>The Kremlin has intensified its effort to increase its long-term control over the Russian information space, threatening the credibility of Russian sources that inform the wider Western coverage of battlefield realities in Ukraine.

About damn time. Ukraine's been in full control of their space since the second month of the war.

And for another thing, one doesn't clamp down on something if they don't feel they're losing control. Prigozhin's rebellion sparked this little change in Putin, so it's fascinating to see ideas he pushed whisper from the words of others.

Context from yesterday: “Vostok” Battalion commander Alexander Khodakovsky suggested that Russia freeze the war in Ukraine along the current frontlines, reintroducing a narrative that had been largely dormant since Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin’s armed rebellion.""

>Ukrainian Operational Command South Spokesperson Captain First Rank Nataliya Humenyuk challenged Russian claims that Russian authorities have adequately repaired the Chonhar bridge after a Ukrainian strike on August 6.

Ha!

New game. The Chonhar Bridge is 300m long. Counting from the south-east, guess the meter upon which Ukraine's next missile lands. I'll buy the winning guess gold.

>Russian forces conducted offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line, near Bakhmut, along the Aviivdka-Donetsk City line, and in the eastern Donetsk-western Zaporizhia border area on August 18 and advanced in some areas.

Spoiling attacks everywhere Ukraine isn't attacking. The fact that they're wide-spread means that Russia is compensating for something happening elseware. Remember, each of those attacks means poorly trained conscripts attempting to take positions with no air support and minimum artillery support. The casualties must be insane. You don't do this at three different points if something isn't happening that deserves it.

1 'failed' Ukrainian offensive: unwinnable war, time to give up it's so joever

The current offensive is clearly not going exactly to plan, but the narrative that this means Ukraine and its backers have to just give up is bizarre, defeatist nonsense that plays into the hands of bad actors. How many failed offensives or even catastrophic defeats did the entente/allies have in WW1 and WW2? This is a total, existential war. Losing once doesn't mean the end.

Ukraine still has strong national morale and Russia is unable to decisively win by eg. destroying the Ukrainian military or taking Kyiv. If France can hurl 8 million men into the trenches to liberate their territory or Britain can be kicked out of Europe, lose all their heavy weapons and endure months of heavy bombing, Ukraine can and will take years more of this to win. They choose to keep fighting so we can choose to keep supporting them until they win.",False,1692504199.0,t3_15v5or4,t3_15v5or4,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

>“During the operation, an emergency situation occurred on board the automatic station, which did not allow the maneuver to be performed with the specified parameters,” Roscosmos said in a Telegram post.

>“The management team is currently analyzing the situation,” the space agency added.

In the latter, you had well-trained paratroopers holding the line, where they regularly fell back without routing, taking up new lines of defense, right up until they abandoned Kherson itself.

Contrast that to the soldiers on the defense now: mobiks that can defend where they stand, but attack poorly, and retreat even worse: in the daylight, running into their own minefields, getting picked off by FPV drones or obliterated by cluster munitions. 

A Kherson-style withdrawal to prepared defenses was probably what Surovikin had in mind when he prepared his line. But then Gerasimov decided to burn away tens of thousands of bodies in the winter offensive, among them what’s left of the paratroopers and the most experienced soldiers.

So now the generals don’t want to risk a major withdrawal, as the chance of discipline breaking down among the mobilized is too high. So they throw them into the fray, trading away lives for the ability to make a slow and tightly managed retreat.  

But in the end, they might be forced to test their luck with a major withdrawal anyways. Because once a serious breach is made, unable to be contained by reserves, and discipline breaks down, it will be open season on routing Russian meat.",False,1692420823.0,t3_15v5or4,t1_jwtgtps,,1,39,0,39,0,0,

That was addressed in a summary of a Youtube video from a guy I follow that has been analyzing the war:

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14tt4cw/comment/jr78g04/?context=3

In summary, Russia is prematurely using its reserves to keep Ukraine from reaching its main defensive lines. Either because they dont actually trust in them or to portray the illusion that the offensive is failing or stalling. That video was made around 2 months ago.

Seeing people call this unexplainable Russian unwillingness to use its defensive lines makes me think that indeed the analysis was correct and if it is then it is a big problem for Russia, because it means that when they reach the surovikin line proper it will be undermaned or that when it is breached Russia will just not have anything to contain the breakthrough and it will be a rush to the coastal area.",False,1692429461.0,t3_15v5or4,t1_jwtgtps,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

They would emphasize finding optimal positions for fire over safety - even accounting for some losses, fire would be executed with sufficent volume to stop be effective. 

The current issues for Russia (besides overall issues with command and communication between fighting forces/artillery/command units, simplified tactics to ease the burden on training a conscript army, or the degraded state of the logistical transport pool) tie into the lack of planning flexibility and modern weapons.  The widespread Ukrainian arrangement and opportunistic offensive and defensive operations are forcing the artillery to cover as much of the front as possible.   The advent of free roaming spotting and prosecution of attacks by aerial drones are making it hard for Russia to hide their artillery.

The time from target acquisition to fire mission can be as little as 30 to 45 seconds. Information in GIS Arta is sourced from drones, targets reported by forward observers armed with cell phones, counter battery radars, and satellite-based imagery. GIS Arta even embeds information like munition suitability into its targeting process.

>Address of the ""Azov"" regiment to Russia:  
It's usually the thief who yells ""Catch the thief!"" the loudest.Kremlin's propaganda calls us nazis and fascists, and themselves - liberators, who came to ""denazify"" Ukraine.Nowadays, the entire world is living in the world of great deceptions, great lies, and tiny truths.Billions of dollars go into creating an illusion of grandeur and promoting the misanthropic ideas of ""russian world"". That very one which brings destruction, death, sorrow, starvation, and fear.The only remaining weapon in this fight is the Truth.And the Truth is as follows: our land was dishonorably attacked by an insidious monster, and we have the right and the obligation to defend it.Azov stands at the front of this defense.Azov is the subdivision of the National Guard, formed by volunteers in 2014, after Russia took away Crimea and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. It's a subdivision where Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Greek, Georgians, Crimean Tatars, and Belarusians serve. In this subdivision, for 8 years, shoulder to shoulder, serve soldiers of various faiths: Orthodox, Catholics, Protestants, pagans, Jews, and Muslims. Most in it speak Russian.We despise nazism and stalinism. Because our country suffered the most from these totalitarian regimes and deceitful ideologies.Russia is bombing Babin Yar, where the victims of 20th century nazism are buried. Putinists drop tons of shells on the hospitals, schools, kindergartens, churches. Putin's soldiers shoot the elderly, kill the children and pregnant women, just like the Hitlerites did before.Nazism is an insatiable need to kill the people who dared to become free. It's the conviction in your own right as some sort of superstate and the right to control other nations, while raping and pillaging other countries. Does it not remind you of anything?The difference is that Azov was, is, and will be Ukraine's shield until the invader leaves our country. We have never attacked anyone, and the main goal of Azov is to protect and develop its country, its nation, and the lives of our citizens are more important than ambitions of any politician.We, the defenders of the city-hero Mariupol, took up the sword and shield that not only defend Ukraine from the forces of evil and deceit, but the entire world from the 21st century plague. If we lower this sword, then tomorrow the same fate will befall Kyiv and Lviv, and the day after - Warsaw, Berlin, and Paris. We wish for the thinking Russian people to dethrone the government that's sending its sons to a certain death for the sake of deceitful illusions of a poisoned reality instead of letting the Russian nation live, love, and develop.

Another thing I'm curious about intellectually is whether the command structure of the Russian BTGs are still locked into the same structure as the beginning of the war.   The Russians have normally  linked command of individual artillery batteries to the overall batallion HQ command - much like it was in the Soviet era.  Russian strategy (at least at the start of the war) relies so heavily on timed phases for offensive and defensive actions on all operational combat elements, and that timing was dictated at the command level.  

Western strategy relies on a a separate batallion artillery command model, where fire mission priority, timing and operations were coordinated and determined by the artillery unit HQ without the phased executions dictated by batallion HQ.

Hahaha, wow, it absolutely wasn't and he still rides his dick. This hand waving away his actions and rhetoric is absurd.

The blackmail and wanting to stop weapon transfers as soon as he is president.

I didn't ignore it, I just felt it was correct enough not to respond to.
