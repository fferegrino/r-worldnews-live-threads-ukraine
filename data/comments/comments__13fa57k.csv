> > DNR - Rostov. To gain a foothold there, to sit on the defensive, as Gerasimov said, ‘in order to block the enemy on their territory,’” says an officer from the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. 

> According to our sources, Gerasimov's retreat plans were prompted by the events of last fall, when, after the defeat in the Kharkiv region, Russian troops lacked both a withdrawal plan and the formation of a new line of defense. Then it took more than a week to organize the control of the retreating troops. Given the much larger scale of the Ukrainian offensive now being prepared, the lack of plans in case of defeat could lead to a military disaster. In addition, **Gerasimov assesses the combat effectiveness of Russian units and the reliability of defense extremely negatively. If the Ukrainian offensive cannot be stopped in the first 48 hours, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine are able to break through the Russian defenses in different directions, then the Russian Armed Forces will begin to implement one of the eight retreat plans.**

> > “There are eight of them because Gerasimov requested that of us, here the Academy of the General Staff. And also because we do not know how many offenses there will be or in which directions. Looking at the intelligence data, the Ukrainians can attack in general at any point from Svatovo to Aleshki.  Moreover, they can attack simultaneously in three to five directions and with large forces,"" says an officer of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. 

> Judging by this cautious initiative [advice] of Sladkov,^* a ""military officer"" close to Gerasimov, the Russian military is seriously considering the option of standing on the borders of the Russian Federation for a long time and accumulating forces for ""we can repeat."" Everything will depend on the success of the Ukrainian offensive.

Though since their article is behind a paywall I'll just post a translation of another article quoting them: 


>Another Group received a contract

>Prigozhin was not supposed to play a role in Ukraine invasion

>The revelation is explosive: the Wagner mercenary group was not supposed to play a role at the start of Russia's Ukraine invasion. Its chief, Prigozhin, was downright ignored. The contract was awarded to another group. However, it suffered massive losses.

>The notorious Wagner mercenary force was apparently not to play any role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine at first. This is suggested by mobile phone data and witness statements available to ""Der Spiegel"" and the Russian investigative platform ""The Insider"".

>According to them, a new mercenary company called Redut, attributed to former Wagner man Anatoly Karaziy, was supposed to play a far more important role. GRU deputy chief Vladimir Alexeyev is said to have literally cut Prigozhin in the run-up to the Russian invasion - while communicating intensively with Karaziy and other key figures in preparation for the invasion, according to his cell phone connection data.

>According to the data, Alexeyev pushed away a call from Prigozhin on his cell phone on Feb. 20, 2022 - four days before the war began. There is no recall or further communication in the phone records. It was not until the afternoon of the start of the war on February 24 that the two communicated again - for only one minute and 42 seconds. Even after that, there was radio silence between the two for several weeks.

>The cell phone data substantiates statements by several sources that Prigozhin and his mercenary force were not supposed to play a role in the Russian invasion. Instead, Redut had recruited several thousand mercenaries - including many ex-Wagner people.

>Prigozhin wanted to kill competitors

>Prigozhin does not seem to have been unaware of this. According to several people with knowledge of the events, Prigozhin is said to have angrily approached Alexeyev as early as the end of January. He would ""kill"" his ex-employee and new competitor Karaziy. Alexeyev is said to have coolly referred him to Karaziy himself. The latter is said to have been in an office at GRU headquarters at the time.

>The mercenaries of the Redut company are said to have suffered the heaviest losses in the first weeks of the war - while Prigozhin was assembling troops for an operation in Ukraine at his own risk.

>From March 19, 2022, Prigozhin and Alexeyev communicated regularly by cell phone. Prigozhin publicly designated March 19 as his entry date into the war.

In order to get through the Entente mastered ""bite and hold"" tactics where they would take a small portion, defend it, move everything up and then repeat the process. A rapid breakthrough was impossible but slow prolonged pressure focusing on just the immediate and less manned front line proved to be a major weakness of defense in depth.

In Kherson 2022 Ukraine liberated what had been one of Russia's biggest prizes of the war. They did so not by fighting in the streets of Kherson but by slowly pushing up against a fortified Russian perimeter until their HIMARS were in range of the river crossings. Russian defenses became untenable and they were forced to abandon the city.

I don't know what to expect if/when the ""counteroffensive"" occurs. It's possible Ukraine will use some form of Blitzkrieg to rapidly break through and then exploit Russian weaknesses. It's also possible that Ukraine also goes for very limited advances so they can get HIMARS within range of more Russian supply lines and then make Russian positions untenable.

On March 30, 2022, the russians retreated. 368 people, including 69 children, who spent almost all of March 2022 in the basement of a school (about 400 people lived in the village), testify that the russians forced them to go to the basement with the words ""this is for your safety"". The aim was to create a ""human shield"" to protect the command headquarters above the basement. 

Individual soldiers also committed war crimes. One threw a smoke grenade into the basement of a house and forcibly closed people in the same basement for several days. Others shot the son-in-law of a woman. The woman's house burned down as a result of shelling. After the liberation, she lived in the kitchen. Only in December her house began to be rebuilt. Now there are already windows and a roof. This is one of the houses for which the Latvian government allocates money. 

Documents were found that helped establish the identities of dozens of russian soldiers. All photos that were found were shown to people in the village. If people testified about the criminal actions of any of the soldiers and recognized them, it was brought into separate cases. For example, a soldier led a civilian to the fence, asked about the positions of the Ukrainian military, threw a grenade at his feet, threatened to kill him; the victim fell to the ground to defend himself, the soldier laughed.

To think Wagner and RF would abandon Bakhmut after spending so much to finally gain a controlling interest in such embarrassing fashion in a feint seems unlikely. Gerasimov wrote up the plans for a retreat and that seems to have manifested itself nicely. In WWII, Marines fought insanely brutal battles with very high casualties to gain control of islands in the Pacific that would later be deemed strategically insignificant. This had an effect on those who had bled and watched their friends die for that insignificant island. 

It's clear that even though Ukraine was limited in how much land they could recapture, the destruction of so many logistics hubs and command structures for the RF had a cumulative effect that continues to be felt and easily observed such as the constant whining about ammo. Russia was deprived of munitions at a crucial time, when Ukraine would be at its weakest, before the supply of western armor.

I do believe that the brunt of the counter offensive hasn't began in earnest. I think this is an opening phase and is intended to sow chaos and fear in Russian forces. It is strange that Prigohzin is so willing to throw MoD under the bus publicly in the manner he is. He is really turning into an effective agent of chaos for Ukraine. Is it possible that after 8 months of fighting Ukrainians, that he simply realizes the idiocy of trying to take the country of such a determined defender? It's not uncommon for adversaries to respect and even admire their enemy on the battlefield. Unlike Putin, the man can speak with some first-hand experience on the matter.

I can only think it is either brainwashing and experience ""the Ukraine troops will be as bad to me as we were to them, I was told so""

or

""our medics are so crap I am going to bleed out slowly and die painfully"".

This must indicate insanely low morale. If it is the former then as soon as Ukraine makes a teeny tiny breakthrough they would all be petrified and run (which would explain the other day in Bakhmut) and if it is the latter it would explain the guy surrendering and running through live fire to surrender. ""Get wounded during your surrender is fine if they have medics because we ain't got shit and we are dying from barbed wire scrape tetanus over here""

All in all it seems to me there might not even need to be a Grand Counter Offensive in any real sense if morale is so bad. Punch a small hole in a line, watch everyone run away or surrender. Rinse and repeat.

I am not even a warcraft player general (I like the brum brum car games!) but it seems to me overwhelming force on a tiny area would be pretty easy with the mobility Ukraine has now. Like 10 russians in a position so some himars, some armour, some drones, some grenade chucking guys jumping out of a bradley or similar would easily trounce them if there was no russian artillery support. Then the troops to the side of the position run away from the flank attack and Ukraine can basically fade back or occupy or whatever. But that bunch of russians are close to useless forever; dead/captured/demoralised.

There’s much new information, but it has to yet be confirmed...*  (location links added by me.)

> 💥*The results of the ‘first day of the offensive operation’ of the Armed Forces of Ukraine* 

> On the evening of May 11, the Russian ""military correspondents"" created a real panic in the z-segment of Telegram, announcing the “offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in all directions at once,” including the fantastic claim of Belgorod and Kursk, too. [See here](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13fa57k/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jjx2k5d/) Opposition [Russian] channels mocked their opponents to their heart's content and informed them that there was no offensive yet.

> Let's make it clear right away: an offensive is not thundering columns of tanks, which at a given hour, at the signal of a trumpet, move off and roll at the enemy under flying flags.  No.  An offensive is a series of large and small operations on various sectors of the front, starting exactly when it is most justified by accumulated resources necessary, weather conditions, and enemy actions. 

> The Armed Forces of Ukraine have been conducting such operations for the last week and a half. At what point the ‘big offensive’ will start is impossible to say, because this is not a rock concert with an exact start time. As soon as tactical tasks in different directions are addressed and solved, there will be major strikes. With a high probability, you can expect them in the next few days.

> *The Situation as of 17:30, May 12, 2023*

[**NEW INFO STARTS HERE** ⬇️ ]

> [*Bakhmut direction*]

> On May 10 and 11, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were able to dislodge the RF Armed Forces from positions near the road to Chasov Yar, [and] from positions around the village of Kleshchevka [Klischiivka].  There, the **Armed Forces of Ukraine took/settled in the hills**; the village can be abandoned by Russian formations within a day. So, the offensive operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine south of Bakhmut continue. The **RF Armed Forces are withdrawing.**

> On the evening of May 11, the Armed Forces of Ukraine struck in the area of the Berkhovsky reservoir and on the village of Berkhovka (north of Bakhmut) [Berhivka], and also launched a series of attacks on Russian positions between Bakhmut and Soledar. According to Ukrainian and Russian officers, **the Berkhovskoye reservoir** [here](https://goo.gl/maps/cVGwuJgHERp6aGzo6) **came under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine overnight,** fighting continues in Berkhovka, but the **RF Armed Forces are retreating.**

> The **LPR units, which occupied positions near Soledar, suffered heavy losses and retreated,** the [RF] army units hastily tried to close the holes. Since the morning of May 12, shelling of Russian positions and attempts to break through continued. This is not about hundreds of tanks, but about the actions of platoons and squads with the support of infantry fighting vehicles and artillery. As the past 24 hours have shown, Russian troops abandon their positions if at least one Ukrainian assault group breaks through the defense line. They fear encirclement and a repetition of last September in the Kharkiv region. There is no talk about the collapse of the entire front near Bakhmut-Soledar *yet,* nevertheless, the long-suffering Bakhmut can be surrounded by the Armed Forces of Ukraine within two days. 

> In such a case, the PMC can be used as a barrier, in the ring, distracting the Ukrainian troops while the RF Armed Forces are “regrouping”. 

> The transfer of army reserves to Bakhmut and Soledar, according to reports both from the Russian and Ukrainian military, has not yet been noticed. Moreover, a source at the headquarters of the RF Armed Forces group claims that Valery Gerasimov **forbade the withdrawal of reserves.**

_____

> *Vulgedar*

> On May 10-11, the Armed Forces of Ukraine **drove the Russian Armed Forces out of the settlement of Novodonentske** [here](https://goo.gl/maps/Vhf1vv4fDDvAs8T86).

> On the night of May 11-12, the **RF Armed Forces retreated from Novomayorovsky** [here](https://goo.gl/maps/SFbCGsUr9BDW1NqU7), the Armed Forces of Ukraine are **moving east towards Pavlivka**, [here](https://goo.gl/maps/CGUxMMiAet86Eub88). The *very one* that the Russian generals laid down up to a third of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet for, back in January-February of this year. **If the RF Armed Forces lose their positions in the Pavlivka area, then the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be able to operate in the direction of** 
[Staromlynivka](https://goo.gl/maps/zbCXqau1fVv39ikx5), [Volnovakha](https://goo.gl/maps/EhUH7uqHGTjqeE2y7) **and Mariupol without fear of attacks from the eastern flank.**

______

[*Misc, HQ*]

> There are no active hostilities in other areas yet.  Shelling, reconnaissance in force, nothing more. 

> According to reports from the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces, the situation of last September is repeated—specifically, when the command pretended until the last moment that there was no Ukrainian offensive, trying to spin a version of events palatable/digestible for the Kremlin, eventually coming up with ""regrouping.""  Incidentally, the Ukrainian military and politicians are *playing along with* the Russian Defense Ministry, ie, making it clear in every possible way that nothing has begun yet.  While surprising, according to sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Security Council, the Russian leadership *maniacally believes* Ukrainian statements [regarding counteroffensive timing].

> The *large-scale* Ukrainian offensive has not yet begun, we see the *beginning* of a large operation. With a high probability, soon the ""military correspondents"" will have new reasons for a chorus of panic.

i figure ukraine just rotated troops over most of the front line and i think this is the last rotation before the counter offensive. i figure they are burning off stock of most soviet tech so that the supply line can run with all western/nato equipment for the offensive. i figure instead of the next rotation, the offensive will attempt to move the front line onward from wherever these men and women stop.   


i figure that ukraine has 2 or three areas that will get hit simultaneously in the counter offensive with one or two groups in reserve to punch through whichever option is weakest along with massive amounts of logistic and other support that will be speeding to the new front line before it even starts moving.   


lastly i figure that we are a week or two from the ""find out"" stage of FAFO, but during this time there will be a lot of russian surrenders and a lot of targeted strikes to mess up their command/control and logistics.

> The majority of respondents also reject the invitation of Ukraine to join NATO, as demanded by Selenskyj. Fifty-four percent are opposed and only 27 are in favor of holding out the prospect of membership to Ukraine at this time. Selenskyj is attending the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in July and hopes that the way will be cleared there for his country to join the defense alliance. Neither in Ukraine nor in Europe nor in NATO would the majority of the population understand if Kiev did not receive a ""well-deserved invitation,"" he said in a speech in April.

> Let's address the situation as it happened. The Wagner PMC first spent a long time surrounding Bakhmut, then began moving into Bakhmut itself. The entire operation to enter Bakhmut lasted from October 8, seven months. During that time we took the Berkhivka reservoir, the Berkhivka settlement, in the direction of Sloviansk, among other things. Now the reverse process is taking place. 

> After we handed over the flanks, there was not a tactical retreat, so Comrade Konashenkov lied, to put it mildly. There was a flight of the MoD units from the flanks, and so the approach to the Berkhivske reservoir, if anyone looks at the map, I will not show you mine, because there is a lot of extra information, but if you look at what is happening in the Berkhivka settlement, it means that the enemy will approach Bakhmut and will be within 500 m from Bakhmut, occupying all of the tactical heights. 

> With the loss of the Berkhivske reservoir, with the loss of these territories that were abandoned, which is 5 sq. km. just today, the enemy has completely cleared the road Chasiv Yar - Bakhmut, which we blocked, what was called ""encircling Bakhmut"", and the enemy can use this road - one, and two - they have taken tactical heights, from which Bakhmut is exposed as in the palm of their hand. 

> The next step, when they enter the village of Berkhivka, will be a gradual encirclement of Bakhmut. Exactly what I have been saying for a long time. So the Defence Minister and the Chief of General Staff achieved by their actions: first, they downsized the Wagner PMC so that we could not hold the flanks, then they decided that their brave military would hold the flanks, but they fled. We still do not receive ammunition, they give us 10 percent of what we need at most, so we cannot actually cover the military with our fire. We are not given weapons and military equipment, and they expect Wagner PMC to completely run out of steam. 

> We continue storming the 'nest' in Bakhmut. Today we occupied another building overnight, occupied several more stairwells in the morning, we still have about 20 buildings left and Bakhmut will be completely captured. About 20 high-rise buildings, not counting the small stuff in the residential sector. But taking Bakhmut accomplishes nothing, because the flanks are collapsing, the front is buckling, and the Defence Ministry's attempts in the information space to somehow smooth things over, it only leads to and will result in a global tragedy for Russia. You need to stop lying immediately. If you run away, build new defence lines, but what you have prepared for this defence is not something that can hold that defence, it is simply nothing. 

> And so what has been happening recently and what I have warned about for a long time is beginning to unfold towards a great tragedy for our country. And, on a different point, when we received a combat order on May 7, as I have already said in this combat order there were 4 items. Number one, if the Wagner PMC leaves Bakhmut without the permission of the Chief of Staff, it will be regarded as high treason. Second: we are given ammunition in the amount we ask for. Third: we are given Army General Surovikin for communication and fourth: all flanks are to be taken by the MoD. 

> Point by point: Surovikin was assigned, the flanks were taken over in such a way that it would have been better not to even start, no ammunition was given, and the last question, which I have mentioned first, about treason, does this rule apply only to PMC Wagner or to the military leadership, through whose actions these flanks were lost, who will be responsible for treason?

The reason why a solider kills themselves when they sustain an injury is they are certain their life from that point on won’t be worth living.

A few things come into this calculation.

Firstly the perceived severity of the injury. If you’re going to be living your life a dribbling mess, a lot of soldiers are happy to give that a miss.

Secondly, the level of available treatment, as you said, if infections aren’t being treated, then what’s considered a catastrophic injury will be different.

Thirdly, the amount of physical pain involved. Some spinal injuries cause unimaginable pain that can break someone’s will to live in an hour or even minutes.

Fourthly, recent repeated trauma. Repeated trauma is different from trauma. If a soldier hasn’t had enough breaks from fighting then they will get PTSD. Even minor injuries in a soldier suffering from PTSD can cause them to believe themselves to be catastrophically injured.

Fifthly “morale”. This essentially boils down to the amount of physical and emotional support a soldier feels he is getting. If you are a prisoner moblik who has no family, and you know no one cares about you, your view on suicide after injury where you won’t be able to fend for yourself will certainly be effected.

It also is relevant in the broader sense. If you feel like your country or your officers won’t support or try to look after you when you are injured, then pulling the trigger also becomes more attractive.",False,1683934414.0,t3_13fa57k,t1_jjxlwyj,,1,36,0,36,0,0,

The Kharkiv factory (Morozov) developed the T-64, which was great, but was complicated and expensive, so in Sverdlosk, Uralvagon, their rivals developed the T-72, less ""Gucci"" but more available.

Ever since iterations of both have been developed, and the quality in the end after about 60 years lies on how good of a kit they put on them.

Oplot descends from that original Kharkiv line, and these tend to be better than their contemporaries made by Uralvagon. (T-72s, T-90s)

T-64s and their developments (such as the T-80) were meant to equip the best Soviet units going up against NATO in Germany while the T-72 was to be more utilitarian, and was exported more often.

I don't think they will make very many however, the factory that designed and produced the model is in Kharkov and quite damaged. Other production centers are unlikely to be able to do large scale production. Those who can would be better served making more BTR-4E which is a highly capable IFV, something that is in great demand in this conflict.",False,1683931315.0,t3_13fa57k,t1_jjxhj67,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

One big advantage is they already have tank brigades that are used to machines  that apart from some new doodads are very like these, little additional training will be needed, so almost every tank they can get off the production line will be usable almost immediately. 

Russia doesn't have all that much in reserve of that sort of quality left, and such a tank would greatly outclass some of the material the Russians have been putting out there recently. So... tank for tank, pretty damn well.

The big problem will be numbers -- if they can field even a few dozen really soon it will certainly help with the offensive, but they will really need hundreds to make the decisive difference they're hoping for. More than a handful arriving any time soon seems highly unlikely. 

I presume they'll do what they have been doing -- mostly using their advantages pretty shrewdly, and they'll probably make good use of whatever they can field. I don't expect that will involve a lot of straight tank vs tank battles, since that would tend to play more to Russia's numerical advantages. There will be some combined arms operations which the Ukrainians seem to manage pretty well, and the Russians not quite as well (though they have been learning), but they will want to do more of the recon-in-force, followed by rapid exploiting of breakthroughs using lighter armor like what they did last year (thunder runs). Where they can get through several layers of Russian defensive lines, there will tend to be total havoc, and such tanks as those will be important in some stages of achieving such breakthroughs before the faster lighter runs deep into occupied territory that will follow them. If they can get say a dozen on the line in the next month, I expect they will do pretty well but I would think it may be very few indeed.

In the longer term it's a great sign; Ukraine being less beholden to some of the Western politicians that say one thing and (eventually, maybe) deliver another will help them in several ways. They can control their own destiny better and own their own victory more wholly. Western aid then becomes more what it should be -- welcome help, rather than their only hope of survival -- laying so much in the hands of others and being so subject to political whims is a poor position to be in. 

It also gives them a new avenue for aid - ""If you won't supply us with the equipment we need, how about some money to help us build our own?"". That may be more politically acceptable to one or two countries that have been slow to supply weapons.",1683948899.0,1683947070.0,t3_13fa57k,t1_jjxhj67,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

What, exactly is China's position?

All we have to go off is their actions, which appear to be enabling Russia, while trying to appear to be some kind of great mediator...

As detailed in the US intel leaks - In Feb of this year, Beijing ""approved"" the provision of weapons to Moscow under the disguise of civilian items according to WaPo.

On March 20th Xi Jinping publicly praised Putin's ""Strong leadership"" and encouraged Russian's to ""reelect"" him in 2024

Xi Jinping stated that Beijing's ""Friendship"" with Moscow is growing daily.

On April 14th - China's Ambassador to France, probably their top ambassador position in the EU stated that ""none"" of the post-soviet states have sovereign status.

On April 18th - China's Defense Minister stated that Putin should be praised for ""promoting"" world peace, stating that Putin is ""An extraordinary state leader"" and has ""made important contributions to promoting world peace and development""

- UA started counterattacks on the north/south flanks of Bakhmut this week. These aren't manned by Wagner, but by regular RF forces that aren't putting up enough resistance to hold UA back. UA pushed them back on a handful of locations on the flanks by 2-3km, recent maps here: [Rybar, pro-RU channel](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1656776967943749635/photo/1) and [from a wagner channel](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1656701559860871169/photo/1)

- this doesn't seem to be ""the"" counteroffensive, the biggest open source analysts seem to agree that UA's pushing to force RU to either commit reserves there and then get smashed in a now weaker part of the front, e.g. Donetsk, north Luhansk or the south, or that they're just taking opportunity of RU's weakness in the flanks with no connection to the counteroffensive. After a few days RU still hasn't stopped them though, so they may just keep going. Nobody knows.

- Wagner continues to fight and push in the city center even as the flanks get pushed back. Wagner claims some city block wins every day this week, but since yesterday UA telegrams claim that they're also pushing back in the center.

For some, it's curious that Russia shoots so many missles only for most of them to be shot down, but it's actually a fairly sound strategy to make your opponent burn their consumables regularly. No missles, no defense. The problem for Russia is that they probably don't have huge quantities of missles to work with themselves. Many missle remains indicate construction late last year.

Supposedly all anti air systems emit unique radar signatures that are very difficult to detect, having to go through lots of frequencies and then triangulate them.  This is a different radar than what long range airport radar emits, much more precise and short range which is why it is used for AA.  

So, to protect your AA missile batteries you use several layers of long range to short range radars and don't turn on the tracking missile AA radar system until you know something is already in the air and in range, because once the AA is turned on it's visible and trackable and easy to target.  There aren't really ""stealth"" AA radars, even the PATRIOT batteries can be detected.  

So, in the Gulf War, the Allies would send fast fighter jets and decoy missiles into range of the AA until it was switched on and immediately the fighter jets would scramble away out of range, then they had a lot of the electronic detection planes circling to find the AA batteries, then they'd map it and they did this for weeks and weeks until they had figured out which radar signal was which, from the 1st detection long range, mid range, and.short range AA batteries.

Then once the campaign started they sent Blackhawk helicopters below the radar deck to destroy the first detection systems, then stealth bombers surgically removed each radar system and more advanced missile AA systems that could threaten normal fighters and
bombers, then they took at the AA guns and last defense radars.

Shoigu doesn't like Prigozhin - and vice versa.

Prigozhin didn't live up to his promises, and his supply line was cut off. This ended up being used as a convenient excuse.

Of course if we want to talk about the practicality of alliances we need to look at the world as it is and not on a massively zoomed out timeframe or the figment of imagination that geopolitical ""Realists"" like to conduct. If we're talking about in that sense alliances between Democratic states tend to be very strong and long lasting. Cultural connections, economic connections and similar value systems do matter. Moscow can convince the Russian people relatively easily that they need to invade Ukraine but try to honestly comprehend what the Washington would have to say to convince Americans they need to bomb Canada? What would it take in a 21st century context to get Japan to invade Australia? What on earth would motivate France to roll tanks into Luxembourg?

What underpins NATO alliances aren't just ""interest"" but deep similar values, economies and cultural connections that makes wars between them almost comical to seriously think of.

The current status quo is that Belarus is fairly pliable to what Russia wants in that they let Russia use Belarus as a staging ground and launch missiles from there, but not completely pliable since Belarusian forces have not joined the fight itself.

By taking out Luka that leads to several possible scenarios. It's possible Russia would be able to quickly either just annex Belarus or install an even more pliable leader who would do everything they want instead of just most of what they want. But it's also possible Belarus would fall into mass civil unrest and/or a civil war or uprising and the chaos would make it harder for them to actually do what they are already doing in Belarus and chaos on your border is never good so this would be bad for them. It's even possible an uprising could install a new government that is less aligned with Russia.

So it seems like the risks are too big as there are a bunch of possible bad outcomes for Russia if they did this. But that's assuming they are actually acting rationally. Invading Ukraine the way they did also had a bunch of potential bad outcomes for Russia and they did it anyway so their decision making seems poor at evaluating possible negative consequences. So it could just be as simple as Luka wasn't meeting 100% of their demands, so they decided to get rid of him and didn't bother to properly consider the consequences of doing so.

Firstly there are a number of logistical issues which would make it particularly difficult for him to deploy his penis in-mouth and it will take several years to resolve them in any event. The question of adequate lubricant, controlling ejaculate outflow and saliva inflow and appropriate dirty talk delivery would need to be sorted through. You're not just asking him to supply his penis to your mouth, with that comes a complicated chain of maintenance and supply needs for a penis.

Also, his penis is sophisticated, difficult to use technology well beyond anything you would be familiar with. It would take many months, perhaps years to effectively train you to be able to operate his penis and that is not practicable at this time.

More than that there's a real question whether a penis is even the best option for your mouth at this time. Thats why the administration is focused on providing toes, fingers and boiled sweets for sucking because of the potential in theatre defences available against penises.

We are strongly of the opinion that Poles never believed it. ""We made all the meat in the world this quarter!"" ""I can see the shelves at the butchers you dickheads, not going to say anything out loud""

We are strongly of the opinion that American propaganda is way better because it is close enough to the truth that people do believe it.

By financing the more extreme groups on both sides they help to further drive conflict and division within the nation.  If they financed just the one side then at worst they would push the Overton window over in that particular direction but by financing both sides then you end up with groups trying to push the Overton window in their particular direction and getting into conflict the groups on the other extreme.

So, sure, no free pass. However this US recalcitrance is kind of in keeping with a US stance we expect and understand out here and I sort of prefer it. The president of the time lives with his decisions; Obama drones, Bush WMDs. It's not all they did and there is nuance.

It depends on how you define a Russian national. 22 USC 1641(7), for example, defines a “Russian national” as including “any corporation or business association organized under the laws, decrees, ordinances, or acts of the former Empire of Russia or of any government successor thereto…”. This is just an example of how a “Russian National” might be defined, but it is useful as an example of how one might argue that Wagner, and it’s members, should not be considered Russian nationals.

According to what I’ve seen online**, PMC’s or mercenary groups are de facto illegal under Russian law (or according to their constitution?), but they continue to exist and operate because the Russian government turns a blind eye to their existence (because it is convenient and useful for Russia).

In this example, the Wagner association would arguably not be a “Russian National” as their existence is illegal under Russian laws, and therefore they can not be “organized under the laws… [of Russia].” If Wagner itself is proven to be a mercenary company, then there is a strong argument to be made that all of their members are also mercenaries.

Years later, in the early 1970s, the NKVD’s successor, the KGB, managed to rub such a gel on the skin of a dissident Soviet writer, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, but it failed to kill him, only making him severely ill.

The book and the movie are about Stalingrad, and the extreme behaviors of the Soviet military taken to their own soldiers AT STALINGRAD was a thing.

For example the Not One Step Back rule wasn't no retreat, it was no unauthorized retreat. And again that rule at the end of July is what created the blocking battalions of 200-400 soldiers per ARMY. Most sources I looked up showed only 1,000 soldiers shot in a 3 month period from the inception to just before Operation Saturn. There were tens of thousands of men detained and/or arrested for court martial on charges of desertion, and that makes more sense than having blocking detachments shooting soldiers during a period where the 62nd Army was fighting house by house in Stalingrad and some divisions were down to just hundreds of men. They simply could not afford to shoot their own troops on the spot. And official blocking detachments seem to be gone by mid 1943.",False,1683909263.0,t3_13fa57k,t1_jjvvl50,,7,2,0,2,0,0,

If someone hates the US, then I say to them, go ahead and hate them! But it doesn't follow that you should also ally yourself with some other evil, harmful party simply because they *also* hate the US. To do so is to be inconsistent and hypocritical.
