A snippet below.

>**Stop Falling for Russia’s Delusions of Perpetual Victory**

>*To be sure, I am not a neutral observer—in fact, I couldn’t possibly be more pro-Ukraine. My view is shaped by being an Eastern European academic working at an elite Western university. But as a researcher who specializes in how people make sense of ongoing conflicts, I believe pointing out some of these biases and blind spots can help us make better sense of the war.*

>*The biggest blind spot of all is the Ukrainians themselves. More than two months into the invasion, it is striking how little agency Ukrainians are habitually given in analyzing unfolding events. The realist (in reality, colonialist) understanding of Ukraine as a passive periphery, the fate of which must be inevitably decided by Russia and the West, has led to underestimations of the role of the Ukrainian armed forces, civil society, national and local governments, and, most of all, Ukraine’s strong will to resist.*

>*Russian aggression is not impersonal, Western assistance is not automatic, and T-72 Russian battle tanks don’t pop off their turrets by accident. This is Ukraine’s new war of independence, a nation-shaping conflict that will define the country’s sense of identity for generations, and Ukrainians have the central role in it.*

>*The best way to mitigate for this is to follow and read Ukrainian journalists, politicians, academics, and others commenting on the war as well as amplify their voices and contributions. Don’t assume that Ukrainians are untrustworthy because they must be biased or are producing and repeating their own forms of propaganda because they are one of the parties to the conflict.*

Day 76 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was quiet again, but we did hear some intense fighting in the distance somewhere in the direction of Belgorod. What we heard might have been coming from Pytomnyk that was confirmed to be liberated just today, the direction from which the sound was coming from matches the report.

Even our mayor has now confirmed that yesterday, for the first time since the beginning of the war, our city wasn’t shelled and that is just great, constant shelling does get old quick. The pace at which our army is liberating our region is incredible; just today, another 3 settlements were confirmed to be liberated. 

From the yet unconfirmed reports our forces might already have reached the border with Russia around Ternova and pushing into Lyptsi, which sounds absolutely amazing if true. It doesn’t even sound all that unbelievable, considering that it was officially confirmed that some of the Russian forces are retreating from Kharkiv to “recover”.

It feels great to finally have some quiet time after all this endless shelling. It felt awful hearing a barrage of explosions near you in the middle of the night, and then having to immediately wake up and run to a safer place.

Still, the scariest thing is definitely when you hear a jet flying above your building. Unlike shelling (which won’t really destroy a building all that much, even if it’s still scary), if a 500kg-3t bomb gets dropped on you it’s just over, nothing will save you from that. And we heard plenty of such bombs being dropped by bombers at some targets very close to us in the first weeks of the war. Thankfully those bombers stopped flying over Kharkiv around mid-march, which was a relief, they are the absolute worst.",False,1652229150.0,t3_um9sio,t3_um9sio,,0,133,0,133,3,0,{'gid_1': 2}

From CNN's Tim Lister in Lviv

The Armed Forces of Ukraine said that the Russians have sent about 500 troops from occupied areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions north into the Kharkiv region.

They gave no explanation for the move, but CNN reported earlier Tuesday comments by local officials in the Kharkiv region that suggested some Russian troops were being sent northward to reinforce supply lines from the border.

Local authorities said there is ""a mass withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Borova and Bohuslavka in the direction of Kupyansk."" 

Kupyansk is an important Russian logistics hub inside Ukraine and may become vulnerable if a Ukrainian counterattack in the region is sustained.

That attack made further progress Tuesday, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, with four more settlements to the north and east of Kharkiv falling under Ukrainian control.

CNN has geolocated video from one of those settlements, showing the Ukrainians in control. The new gains put Ukrainian units within a few kilometers of the Russian border in several areas.",False,1652203431.0,t3_um9sio,t3_um9sio,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Five of Kyiv's metro stations are set to be renamed as the Ukrainian capital looks to ""de-Russify"" its transport network.

Authorities say 170,000 people took part in an online poll to select new names for certain stations with Soviet connotations. City councillors will next look at formalising them.

The voters decided:

Leo Tolstoy Square station should be renamed to honour Ukrainian writer Vasyl Stus

Beresteiska station should be called Buchanskaya

Heroes of the Dnieper should become Heroes of Ukraine

Minsk station should be retitled Warsaw

And Friendship of Peoples should in future be known as Botanical

**A Victory Parade Without Victories**

*(...)*

*It is now apparent that there is no steamroller. The second phase of the war has been underway for a month now and the Russians have made few gains. The encircling movement to eliminate the substantial Ukrainian force in the Donbas has yet to take place.* 

*There have been a few gains but they have been minimal while Ukraine is starting to see some successful counter-offensives pushing up from Kharkiv and eating away at Russian positions in Kherson. The Russian have amassed whatever forces they can muster for this latest push, with little left in reserve, and it does not appear to be sufficient. Equipment is still being lost at an alarming rate.* 

*Meanwhile, advanced artillery pieces from Western countries are being employed by Ukraine, which is likely to add to the attrition of Russian forces. It is not surprising that there are reports of Russian commanders refusing to put their troops into exposed positions.*

*(...)*

*The current consensus is that this war will go on for some time because Ukraine cannot agree to the loss of any territory to Russia while Putin has invested so much in this war that he cannot back off.* 

*It is possible that a stalemate will develop in the Donbas and the fighting will subside to a lower level that both sides can sustain over time, but it is as possible that Russian forces will at some point face a calamitous and humiliating defeat.*

**Destruction of signs, signs of destruction**

*Russia’s president justified his attack on Ukraine by referring to denazification, while Ukrainian inhabitants and authorities compare the behaviour of Russian soldiers with that of German Nazi occupiers. The memory of the Second World War shared by the citizens of both countries could not avoid instrumentalization, especially around the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation celebrated in Ukraine (May 8) and the Victory Day in Russia and Ukraine (May 9).* 

*There is, however, a notable asymmetry in how the Ukrainian and the Russian side use the heritage of the victory over the Nazi Germany. Both are selective, but whereas the Ukrainian side fights iconic signs and appeals to visceral bodily experience through indexes, the Russian side relies almost exclusively on symbols devoid of any relation to lived experience. I will sketch the relations between war-related destruction, lived experienced, and ideology in this blog post dedicated to the defeat of the Nazi Germany 77 years ago.*

Long read: [https://emptiness.eu/field-reports/destruction-of-signs-signs-of-destruction/](https://emptiness.eu/field-reports/destruction-of-signs-signs-of-destruction/)

*According to the Russian sociologist Andrey Pertsev, there is no deep ideological meaning behind this letter, and there is no need for such meaning. Russian authorities do not bother about having a coherent ideology or inculcating it in the population. The population, in turn, does not need to understand or explain anything: the polls and qualitative studies show that Russians’ opinion is fragmented in what concerns the causes and the goals of the war.* 

*The authorities do not need active support, the population is not willing to resist. Z is an ideal free-floating signifier, but nobody even bothers to assemble a coherent ideology around it, to do the populist political work that Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe might have expected to happen. It is a symbol so devoid of meaning that it verges on an index. Z points to pure power and a pure demand for obedience.* 

*There is no need to put on special glasses to see ‘obey’ behind seductive phrases. Obedience itself is the ideology. ‘Z’ appeared as an identifier of the military coercion, and it turned into an index of the political and police coercion.*",1652175131.0,1652174703.0,t3_um9sio,t3_um9sio,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

This would normally be a safe bet, where in the US, attention/focus = resolve.  In fact, I think Biden is getting all he can now for Ukraine before the US gets diverted to the next thing.  However, there are a few things helping Ukraine:

1. Zelenskyy                                                             
2. Putin/Ukraine is a more focused threat/effort than more hazy targets such as Afghanistan or Isis.  Also, honestly, the more Russia talks nukes the more firmly they hold the US voters attention.

Almost everyone who's said something like that means well but is talking completely out of their ass, and is usually just accusing a random person. 

And, I can't stress this enough, starting from the content of a comment or post and deciding someone is an inorganic account based on the content of one comment is fundamentally the wrong way to do this.  You have to look at the actual Reddit account and find indications that the account is inorganic.  Here's my general guidelines of how to do so:

https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetResearch/comments/t8e6z5/masterpost_on_spotting_russian_and_other_disinfo/

These guidelines have held up pretty well.  I think these comment sections have earned a reputation for being reasonably troll free. 

Actual disinfo talking points I have gathered based exclusively on looking at what already proven compromised accounts are saying:

* Russian nationals should be genocided (with the emphasis that they're like Nazis)

* Russian nationals shouldn't be genocided (as a way to signal boost the genocide discussion)

[Less confirmed below this line]

* It's the US/NATO's fault this war started

* Bucha war crimes have little/no evidence

These are the only general intentional trends I've been able to parse. There ARE one off comments from these accounts about all sorts of things, but those aren't intentional campaigns, they're just what genuine Russians/Russian sympathizers think. 

Which leads me to my next point. 

Misinformation is a distinct different thing than disinformation.  Disinformation is a planned campaign of intentional lies, wheras misinformation is large amounts of people being wrong and/or morons. 

Tons of talking points that are often called out as disinformation are actually misinformation. The Russia stronk bros talking about how Russia is gonna win based off of crazy rationalizations, or tankies twisting everything to an anti US/West bent, are thuroughly wrong but at the same time real people.  Downvoting them and arguing with them is fine, but it's irresponsible to remove them or write them off as bots because at the end of the day they vote in a lot of north American and European elections. Pretending they don't exist IRL is intellectually dishonest. 

Anyway, that's my rant.

May 9th: **Speech by UK Defence Secretary on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine**

*And throughout the hundreds of years of history – whether of victory or defeat – there is one constant: the junior soldier. The Private, the Rifleman, the Guardsman or the Trooper.*  
  
*Whatever you call them, they are the ones who rarely get to write their own history, or indeed get a say in their future, but it was their ranks that gave the most and bled the most.*  
  
*And it’s why good officers revere them, as the Squaddie or the Tommy or the Jock. Often the last to know, but always the first to fight.*  
  
*I know from my own time in uniform that to be young and to be in the service of your country is indeed a fine thing. It is even finer when the cause that you are serving is a just one.*  
  
*But is it ever easy? Is it comfortable? Is it safe? Emphatically it is not.*  
  
*It can be the most exciting thing in the world to be on operations, but luckily few of us know what it is like to be surrounded, outnumbered and attacked every day.*  
  
*There are some brave souls left from the Korean War and even fewer from the Second World War who do know.*  
  
*It’s why you also find here the permanent exhibition simply called the Soldier. Not just for learning about our past and our past battles but honouring the experiences and sacrifices of the private soldier who fought them.*  
  
*Just over an hour ago and 1,500 miles away, the world was implored to listen and watch Red Square. This is the Victory Parade in honour of the 77th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War.*

149 republicans voted yes, 57 no 3 absent.

This was the bill:

>The bill includes an increase in presidential drawdown authority funding from the $5 billion the Biden administration originally requested to $11 billion. Presidential drawdown authority funding allows the administration to send military equipment and weapons from US stocks.  
>  
>The bill also provides $6 billion in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding, another way the Biden administration has been providing Ukraine with military assistance.  
>  
>There will also be roughly $9 billion to help restock US equipment that has been sent to Ukraine. That comes as many lawmakers have raised concerns about replacing US stocks of weapons the US is giving to Ukraine, especially stingers and javelin missiles.  
>  
>To address humanitarian needs, the bill will include $900 million to bolster refugee assistance, including housing, trauma support, and English language instruction for Ukrainians fleeing the country.

“We, otherwise, continue to believe that President Putin would probably only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state or regime,” she said. “But we will remain vigilant in monitoring every aspect of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces.”

I want to preface this post by saying this is purely speculation. I also support Ukraine fully retaking all land Russia has stolen from them. I am not an expert on anything outside of a few fields unrelated to Ukraine or Russia. My experience with Russia is a fascination with Russian politics since I was 15, living in Eastern Europe and studying Russian in college. I’ve also seen Red Dawn too many times to count. I say this all to illustrate that this is just guessing. If it turns out I’m correct, it’s luck. If I’m wrong, which is the most likely outcome, it is because of the previously stated ignorance. 


Here is my prediction for the next phase of the conflict. 

Biden recently spoke and said he doesn’t think Putin has a way out of Ukraine. Because of Putin’s ignorance about what NATO’s reaction would be, Ukraine’s reaction, and his own military’s capabilities that he may feel trapped. Also, recently, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs has said Ukraine has changed its goals to include retaking all territory Russia has occupied since their 2014 invasion.

I believe this is Ukraine building an off-ramp for Putin to take. If Ukraine’s goals go from retaking pre-2022 territory to retaking pre-2014, it will give them room for negotiation. They can settle for pre-2022 borders, along with other concessions from Russia, and still be victorious. Meanwhile, Russia can claim victory if it can officially recognize those territories as undisputedly “part of Russia.”

Why would Ukraine be okay giving up those areas? Mainly because of the length of time Russia has controlled them and the fact Russia has done their thing and pushed out/killed/kidnapped the Ukrainians in those regions and moved Russians in.  

Of course, as Zelensky has said, giving up any land to Russia would require a vote. I’m not sure if the Ukrainians, being the ballsy fighters they are, would want that to happen. I, personally, would prefer to see Russia driven out entirely. However, since I’m safe and sound in my backyard and not fighting or being bombed, my opinion doesn’t matter. The Ukrainians get to choose what they see as a victory.

A country with a population of 144million. If you consider an average family circle to have about 12 people (includes aunts / uncles / grandpas / etc..), with 25000 RF dead, that means about 1 in every \`500 families have a dead family member now because of this war? Factor in the wounded and maybe it becomes 1 in every 250 families?

I might have not done the math right. I imagine the ratio has to get around where the Afghan Soviet war was for enough internal pressure to build on Putin.

It's nice seeing RF tanks get blown to pieces but seeing the corpses definitely instills a feeling of pity. Suddenly there's a human element to it.

[Syria’s Assad Surfaces in Iran for Rare Foreign Visit](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/syria%E2%80%99s-assad-surfaces-iran-rare-foreign-visit-202294) 

> [Khamenei, Raisi, and Assad] discussed bilateral ties between Iran and Syria, **which grew stronger over the past decade** *as Syria became isolated from much of the rest of the world.*

Russia will find itself in very familiar company in that regards, in just a few months from now. And how many times has Assad been couped, or lost his own war, despite highly expensive investments towards the opposition by the US? Zero… for now. 

>Along with Russia, Iran provided key military assistance to Assad’s government, both directly through the deployment of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force to Syria, and indirectly through the deployment of the Tehran-allied Hezbollah militia, based in neighboring Lebanon, within the country.

Just a FYI, this here is one of the reasons why Israel has not been nearly as proactive in assisting Ukraine against Russia, compared to many of Ukraine’s other allies. 

>Sunday’s visit marks Assad’s second trip to Tehran since the outbreak of civil war in Syria in 2011. In early 2019, the Syrian leader traveled to Iran to hold discussions with Khameini on the Syrian Civil War—**alongside Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force who would later be killed in a U.S. drone strike on the Baghdad International Airport by President Donald Trump.**

Iran is probably still pretty salty about that… 

Additionally, there were reports that Iran was conducting military drills together with Russia and China in recent times, as well as rumors that they were supplying weapons to Russia for Ukraine, through illicit channels in Iraq.

If you step back, it is clear that as heavier involvement in Ukraine grows from the US, the same will be true for Russia’s allies, including Iran and Syria, who both stand to lose very much themselves if Russia loses the war in Ukraine.",1652161226.0,1652161064.0,t3_um9sio,t3_um9sio,,0,-5,0,-5,0,0,

There's a reason why you need to send in direct-fire troops: riflemen, IFVs, and Tanks. Being able to point-and-shoot and **immediately** kill something can only be done in a direct-fire, close-combat situation. (Even a tank at max-range can take multiple seconds for their hypersonic guns to actually kill a target. 3km shots at 1400 meters/second muzzle velocity is around 2+ seconds). Normal guns only fire at ~1000 meters/second.

In theory, you can send a guided-artillery shell and have a nearby unit shine a laser-pointer on the thing it wants to blow up. But why send troops with laser-pointers when you could instead just send troops with guns and bazookas?

--------

Bonus points: when enemy trucks run up against an ambush (guns and bazookas firing at them), those trucks often **stop**, maybe they stand still for 1.5 minutes or so (~90 seconds) as they figure out what to do. That's the time to use artillery.

So, Lend-Lease 2022 is a rehash of a 1941 US law. Prior to the 1941 law, the US was operating under ""Cash and carry"", basically saying that any assistance to the UK (and later other allies, including Russia) needed to be paid for immediately and carried away on a foreign vessel. This really limited the support the UK could get in early WWII.

Lend-Lease basically gave the President very broad authority to give, sell, lend, lease, or ""otherwise dispose of"" military or even tangentially related equipment to any country whose defense was deemed important to the defense of the US. It was a huge step in favor of the UK and against Germany and basically sealed the deal for the US becoming a full member of the Allies later that year.

Lend-Lease 2022 isn't quite the same. Mostly because the circumstances already favored Ukraine. A number of laws had already been passed giving the President broad authority to give aid to foreign countries as they saw fit. The biggest hurdle pre-2022 was the limit, $100 million per year. Lend-Lease 2022 basically says the US President can give military aid to foreign countries up to a budget approved by Congress (so far this number keeps jumping up, current bill is approx. $40 BILLION more), all the President has to do is send Congress a letter saying what they did with the money.

Crucially, it does specify Ukraine, but also says ""Eastern Europe."" If Russia were to suddenly expand the war, or even look like it is thinking about it, the President has no need to wait for Congress to approve things.

So it isn't quite as sweeping as the old one, but really important still. Especially for evoking the memory of the first Lend-Lease.",False,1652159405.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i80jk0e,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Or which have great ranges and could be used against civilian targets, for that matter.  They can deny any request.  

The principal advantage is simply a time advantage.  Now the president can approve transfers without having to draw from a pre-approved congressional nest egg.  He can also continue to carry out approvals without a period of discontinuity, which there would have been had this not passed since the last pre-approved congressional nest egg is nearly used up.  

On Ukraine's side this means equipment they want particularly quickly or in a particular quantity could (if the requests are approved), be considered purchases rather than aid.  But in practice, the idea of Ukraine paying them back with money is unlikely, at least anytime soon.  They're not going to be in any position to do that, so the offers will happen in terms of future deals like eventually some sort of US presence inside Ukrainian territory, or joint missions, or trade favors.  In the meantime, they'll be running up a tab.

1. Its symbolic because its the WW2 era law that saved the UK, Soviet Union by pumping tons of tanks / weapons into those countries in 1943.

2. Its somewhat practical because it lifts some red-tape, and provides the ability for Ukraine to borrow from the USA's arsenal. (Free if they return the weapon later, but they gotta pay if they break the weapon). That's one of the best ""terms of a loan / lease"" ever made in history. (The ""lend"" of ""lend-lease"").

> It's it truly a game changer for Ukraine? 

Kinda sorta. The reason why lend-lease isn't 100% the ""big news"" is because even **better** conditions are coming up. PDA (Presidential Drawdown Authority) is the best terms ever. This isn't ""lend"" or ""lease"" equipment to Ukraine, its wholesale freebies.

The PDA-expansion bill is happening this week, expected to be done by May 19th. Even bigger weapon deliveries are being brought up and debated in Congress.

The ""terms"" of PDA is that President Biden has to give a letter to Congress every now and then that specifies what he gave to Ukraine.

The only way I can see this having a chance of working is if he tries to divide the west by offering a ceasefire. The strategy then would be: 

1 - Bank on fear of war amongst West European states to create pressure to accept;

2 - Rebuild militarily and plan during the ceasefire;

3 - Relaunch the war after the 2024 US election once a more congenial President replaces Biden. (Ideally Trump.)

fwiw, I don't think that will work because I think things have gone too far for a ceasefire offer to be accepted under any terms that Putin could himself accept. Specifically, I don't think there's any chance of a ceasefire that doesn't involve retreating to pre-Feb 24th boundaries getting enough traction in the West. And I don't think politically Putin can give up the southern gains.

As for trying to continue an attritional war, I just don't see it being militarily, politically or economically sustainable. The downside risks for Putin personally would be greater than the upside. Wars of choice don't tend to get more popular as they drag on.

What this reminds me of is when I used to play backgammon. You've doubled from what you thought was a strong position; the opponent's accepted then as things have gone in their favour they've redoubled. And you mis-analyse a losing position to protect yourself emotionally rather than accepting that you fucked up and need to limit the damage.

Consider the following: Putin wasn't intending to fight Ukraine alone, rather he was intending to fight Ukraine with the blessing of the US under Trump. To give that theory a little bit of backstory, remember that in 2016, [Russia directly interfered with the US election](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/report-select-committee-intelligence-united-states-senate-russian-active-measures). Trump ""wins"" 2016, and it was expected that he would maintain control of the US regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election. If Trump lost, then he was counting on Congress not to certify the election. If they certified anyway, then his last resort was to stage a coup. Thankfully, Putin severely overestimated Trump's personal capability to pull any of those things off (just as Trump overestimated the gumption of his zealots).

So Jan 6th 2021 comes and goes, and with it any chance that the US will support Russia; but this isn't the end of the story. Other countries in 2021 such as Germany, the UK and Poland *also* had started their own investigations into election manipulation and political corruption in relation to Russia - thus Russia knew that they were in for a world of hurt *regardless* of their military actions, as eventually the jig would have been up and their activities would be brought to light and subsequently punished.

Thus, Putin, realizing he had the losing hand at the table, tried to pull one last trick out of his sleeve: Military conquest. He knew that sanctions, embargoes and economic trouble would be coming one way or another, but he assumed that if he invaded Ukraine, he'd have something to bargain with: ""I'll back out of further invasion of Ukraine and keep what my soldiers are currently occupying, if you drop the sanctions."" But he overplayed his hand, and instead the countries that were already very mad at Russia became emboldened not just to see Russia fail but to *also* ensure that Ukraine succeeded. Putin wasn't expecting such a swift (pun intended) and unified response from the West. So then his already bad situation became infinitely worse - now he was embroiled in an unwinnable military campaign against an adversary that's being given better weapons than Russia has, with an essentially infinite supply of money to fight as long as needed. But even in light of that, Putin can't back out - to do so would mean he would be instantly deposed by a very angry populace who's children died for nothing; nationalists would see him hanged for letting Ukraine survive, and everybody else would see him hanged for starting the war in the first place.

That explains where he is and how he got there, and it helps inform what his next decisions will be regarding the war. He's already lost - and he knows he's lost - but now it's a matter of seeing his *own* country become so crippled that he won't face consequences for what he's done because there will be no Russian government left to hold him accountable. So that means burning up every resource - money, manpower, and materiel - which is exactly what Putin is doing.",False,1652206835.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i82t736,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Also, both Russian and US assessment was that Zelenskyy & co would flee the country and attempt government in exile - which they know how to countermand with propaganda and intimidation. If they could take out comms and install puppets, they would have the usual police action rather than a military action.  But he stayed.

They did not expect that by not giving the bureaucracy that runs on kleptomania notice that this probably isn't a good time to trade tank sights, MRE and gasoline for dachas... so that the force that crossed the border was a bit short of the tank sights, MRE and gasoline that was supposed to be there. 

They didn't expect US intelligence to fully tip their hands, so that Ukraine could reposition critical air defense, or enable Ukraine to tie up their forces at Hostomel, or for their tire maintenance failures to make it impossible to get fuel to tanks. They didn't factor in the vulnerability of road-confined forces to pre-sighted artillery or drone strike, and the effectiveness of Guerrilla MANPAD tactics.

They didn't expect the west would flood Ukraine with volunteers and support.  Or that it would turn into an actual full-blown conflict. It was, in actual fact, just a ""special military operation"".  At least on paper, that's what it was supposed to be.

And now ultimately, they did not expect the malice at Bucha to be uncovered to western media,  which even their media assets like Tucker Carlson could not wash away.  And they didn't anticipate the resulting arming of Ukraine to the teeth.

Nearly all are reported to have been beaten, tortured, raped, and/or executed. People were typically detained arbitrarily with no evidence, and often not released until families paid bribes. Filtration has been used in Russia/USSR since the first world war, and has been in use in the Donbass areas since 2015 (with lots of horrific accounts from survivors).

Russia currently says about 10% - 12% of refugees in this war are detained in filtration camps (before being sent to refugee centers), and Ukraine suspects that number is much higher. Russia also says over 1 million refugees have reached Russia so far, so you can do the math to see the scale of their filtration process.

As you'd expect, similar stories are emerging: arbitrary detentions with regular abuse, rape, torture, and murder. Another major complaint is that parents are often separated from children, and the children either disappear, or are sent to orphanages/adoption inside of Russia with no attempts made to contact extended family in Ukraine or to notify the Ukrainian government of their ""orphan"" status and destination. 

These aren't camps, like a refugee camp. They are prisons. Or a concentration camp.  Or Torture center. Or Khmer Rouge prison.  Pretty much all the same. But there's no ""I want to go home so I'll just buy a bus ticket.""",1652208784.0,1652206667.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i80lwpm,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Fortunately I was too far away from them to be drawn into their conversation, but nevertheless it seeped into the conversation that I was having with her friend from Estonia (whose English admittedly wasn't the best).  She said something about Russians facing discrimination throughout their diaspora, but tied it into a comment about how she had managed to build a comfortable life for herself in Europe from nothing.  I avoided probing any further, but frankly was completely unsure where she stood on the subject (for all I know, she may have been trying to say that she had not experienced such discrimination herself and believed the claims to be exaggerated).

For example, Americans were easily sold on the idea that they'd ""won"" the war of 1812, many believed they'd won in Vietnam and a whole lot of Republicans were sold on the idea that Iraq and Afghanistan were brilliant victories.

The poked dinner party is not going to be calm or reasonable and little holes in multiples of 4 does not disable them.  

Belarus has borders on Poland and Lithuania.  The people living there should not be forced into a war that they do not want.  

Belarus has strong internal opposition to the invasion of Ukraine.  If the leadership there joins Russia in the war there is a high chance for civil war or insurgency.

So how is Ukraine getting stronger?    
1. They've mobilized their forces, including reserves, that means they're going to have more troops in boots soon if not already and if they're smart they're training them up, both inside Ukraine and outside when feasible.  As more of these forces become combat ready, it'll make a huge impact.  


2. The west is shipping them more and more equipment and supplies.  Now that the logjam over heavy weapons has broken, Ukraine will be able to not only replace losses, but fully equip their mobilized reserves.  


3. A lot of the new western equipment is better than what the Ukrainians were using, and as Ukraine switches over, and gets experience with the new gear, they'll only grow in capabilities.

4. Ukraine has been eager to take advice and training form the west when they can get it, so while they are far from a perfect fighting force, I think they'll be able to work through their structural problems on a far shorter time frame that Russia can.

&#x200B;

And how is Russia getting weaker?

1. They're burning through the quality trained troops, and the new forces are unmotivated and less well trained.  Not to mention the loss of combat officers that the Russian's rely on for command and control.  Even if they mobilize their reserves they'll be pulling in canon fodder to replace trained and experienced soldiers.  If they wait to properly train the new forces, that will take time they may not have as Ukraine gets stronger.

2. They're burning through equipment that can't be quickly replaced.  Their tank manufacturing has stopped as have other military suppliers due to the sanctions.  Given time they can find new sources of needed parts, and redesign their current equipment, but that takes months/years.  As their stocks of missiles, tanks and spare parts dwindle, it will increasingly hamper their military operations or damage their strategic defenses.

3. The longer this goes on, especially with no battle field victories of note and a growing casualty list, discontent on the home front will only grow.  A general mobilization may only exacerbate the discontent.    


If Russia had enough time and commitment to work through its issues, it might be able to turn things around, but Ukraine is not going to sit on its ass and wait for Russia to get into fighting shape, its going to kick butt and force the Russian's to choose between increasingly bad options.

Here is one source used in the article - https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-is-international-media-still-repeating-kremlin-propaganda-about-ukraine/

“This historically illiterate interpretation of the phrase “Glory to Ukraine” is perfectly in line with modern Russia’s preference for viewing all things Ukrainian through the narrow and distorting prism of Ukraine’s World War II-era independence movement. According to this warped logic, “Glory to Ukraine” is a fascist phrase because it enjoyed prominence among Ukraine’s World War II insurgent army, a force which briefly formed a strategic alliance with the invading Germans before fighting against both Nazis and Soviets for the remainder of the war.

These insurgents have long been the poster boys of a Kremlin campaign to justify the invasions of Crimea and eastern Ukraine by painting all Ukrainian patriots as the collective reincarnation of Hitler’s hordes. Indeed, since Soviet times, the preferred propaganda response to the Ukrainian independence movement has always been to brand Ukrainian patriots as fascists, with “Glory to Ukraine” as their version of “Heil Hitler.” 

This depiction was never historically accurate, but the evolution of the phrase in recent years has rendered it absurd. Far from being a product of World War II, the origins of “Glory to Ukraine” are traceable to long before the 1940s. The phrase has its roots in Ukraine’s early twentieth century national liberation movement and was enthusiastically embraced by various different military formations during the failed statehood bid that saw a number of short-lived Ukrainian republics emerge in the chaotic aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution. It has remained in common usage ever since, gaining in popularity during particularly intensive periods of Ukraine’s nation-building story such as the perestroika years and the 2013-14 Revolution of Dignity. Today, “Glory to Ukraine” is a wholly unremarkable patriotic refrain used by everyone from national politicians and celebrities to visiting dignities and diplomats. In this sense, it is comparable to “Vive la France” or “God Bless America.”

So yes, you have earned your downvote for mindlessly parroting Russian propaganda designed to justify their dehumanization of Ukrainians.

>	A proxy war is an armed conflict between two states or non-state actors which act on the instigation or on behalf of other parties that are not directly involved in the hostilities.[1] In order for a conflict to be considered a proxy war, there must be a direct, long-term relationship between external actors and the belligerents involved.[2] The aforementioned relationship usually takes the form of funding, military training, arms, or other forms of material assistance which assist a belligerent party in sustaining its war effort.[2]

*Across Europe, officials have reacted with a mix of disbelief and a sense of betrayal. Even those who cheered Biden’s election and believed he could ease the recent tensions in the transatlantic relationship said they regarded the withdrawal from Afghanistan as nothing short of a mistake of historic magnitude.*

*“I say this with a heavy heart and with horror over what is happening, but the early withdrawal was a serious and far-reaching miscalculation by the current administration,” said Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the German parliament’s foreign relations committee. “This does fundamental damage to the political and moral credibility of the West.”*

*Röttgen, a senior member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, is no flamethrower. He has known Biden for decades and was optimistic about his prospects.*

*While Merkel has avoided direct criticism of Biden, behind the scenes she has made it clear that she considered the hasty withdrawal a mistake.*

*“For those who believed in democracy and freedom, especially for women, these are bitter events,” she told a meeting with officials from her party late Monday, according to German media reports.*

*In the U.K., which like Germany supported the U.S. engagement in Afghanistan from the beginning, the sentiment was similar. “Afghanistan is the biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez. We need to think again about how we handle friends, who matters and how we defend our interests,” tweeted Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the U.K. parliament’s foreign affairs committee.*

*At a time when some European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have been pushing for the bloc to pursue a security policy less dependent on America, Afghanistan is bound to be used as evidence for why “strategic autonomy” is necessary.*

*“Naturally this has damaged American credibility, along with that of the intelligence services and of the military,” said Rüdiger Lentz, the former head of the Aspen Institute in Berlin.*",False,1652208892.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i831seb,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

This was probably a problem prior to 2020 but COVID only made it so he relied on others for his information more. I think he sees now how he was lied to and knows there is no path to victory. The problem is that he has built his entire personality off of being a tough guy so losing isn’t an option. He needs something to call a victory.

Putin's popularity in Russia increased dramatically following the sanctions because in every case where sanctions are applied the population view the foreign power imposing the sanctions as the aggressor and rally behind their leader. It always works that way. Sanctions against Russia at this time are economic madness. The US and EU are in danger of entering a serious recession and inflation is hitting 40 year highs. The sanctions will likely backfire and cause serious hardships in the US and EU, and that's not to mention the effect on global supply chains and trade which will have a negative affect on the poorest countries. The vast majority of the world are not sanctioning Russia for this reason. Not a single African country, one in South America, and only South Korea and Japan in Asia. They aren't supporting the sanctions for the reasons I listed.

Providing heavy weapons to Ukraine from NATO countries is a very risky strategy. Russia are already targeting railroads into Ukraine transporting military equipment and warehouses in west Ukraine where they are being stored. The possibility of NATO troops inadvertently being killed in a strike could spark a response from NATO which could drastically escalate the conflict to a wider European and international scale. If NATO were to get involved and Russia felt really backed into a corner I have no doubt they would begin to target European and American cities with hypersonic missiles. Russia is the only country in the world with hypersonic missiles and they are impossible for existing missile defenses to target. If a full on WW3 scenario were to play out the very real possibility that Russia would launch nuclear warheads on hypersonic missiles becomes likely as they would be aware that NATO forces could absolutely destroy Russia. A nuclear escalation could cost hundreds of millions of lives globally, and the end of modern society as we know it.

Diplomatic solutions are the obvious choice and to argue against it is madness. Ukraine is not capable of winning against Russia. Russia view NATO in Ukraine as an existential threat. They believe their entire country could be at risk, so they cannot back down. If that means Russia finally declare war on Ukraine and decide to launch full scale missile attacks and a full scale invasion millions of Ukrainians will be killed and the country absolutely destroyed. There is zero doubt about that. Anyone who tells you differently is pushing an agenda. Don't be fooled into thinking that Russia have a weak army or military capabilities as western media and the Ukrainian government have suggested. It's simply not true. Yes, they've suffered heavy losses but they are a far from beaten force. In the meantime Ukraine is drafting in soldiers for the front lines that have no military training whatsoever to face off against Russian armored divisions and artillery.

Peace talks are what the world should be pushing for. Not as Chas Freeman has said, ""to fight to the last Ukrainian"".

In terms of who is to blame I would point the finger at the US and it's expansion of NATO primarily. In 1997, 40 senators, foreign policy experts and ambassadors called NATO expansion ""a policy error of historic proportions"", and recognized how it would antagonise and infuriate the Russians. Clinton ignored them.

In 2008, the current CIA director William Burns warned Condoleezza Rice about NATO expansion and the promises made in Bucharest that Georgia and Ukraine would be invited to join NATO and that their membership represented ""the reddest of red lines"" to Russia. He was ignored.

NATO carried out 5 waves of expansion, right up to the border with Russia.

The US backed the coup in 2014 and began to train Ukrainian forces to fight a proxy war in Donbas for the last 8 years.

In July 2021, Zelensky announced that they would launch a military operation to retake Crimea by force.

Towards the end of the year Ukraine began to move troops to the southeast. In response to what Russia thought would be an impending attack on Donbas and Crimea, Russia began to mass troops along the border. In February this year, the shelling of Donbas increased 30 fold from 15th-21st.

That's not really true.

When you look where the leaders came from; it was an Abu Ghraib mass prison breakout.

ISIS was specifically caused by Blackwater torture contractors who ran the torture center at Abu Ghraib.  Then: ""someone"" got these guys organized and armed them, and supplied them with a massive sophisticated online propaganda machine for recruiting. 

Think about who would be capable of that, and you get closer to the truth. 

And finally: members of the Iraqi Baath Party were explicitly NOT Sunni Fundamentalist Extremists (which was the primary makeup of ISIS - think: ISIS did not ever ally with Al Qaida, explicitly because Al Qaida was supposed to be an alliance of all Islam against the West; and ISIS was explicitly Sunni-only, and only accepted a provable direct male-descendant of Mohammad as a leader).  The Ba'ath movement, in Iraq, was an Iraqi Arab Socialist Party, which by charter, included all Iraqi ethnic groups AND religions, including Christians and Shia.

 >Neam ""Nim"" Chimpsky (November 19, 1973 – March 10, 2000) was a chimpanzee and the subject of an extended study of animal language acquisition at Columbia University. The  project was led by Herbert S. Terrace with the linguistic analysis headed up by psycholinguist Thomas Bever. Within the context of a scientific study, Chimpsky was named as a pun on linguist Noam Chomsky, who posits that humans are ""wired"" to develop language. As part of a study intended to challenge Chomsky's thesis that only humans have language, beginning at two weeks old, Nim was raised by a family in a home environment by human surrogate parents.

Knowing full well, perhaps even being assured in advance, that the bill would pass with flying colors (that's how this tends to work, these things are rarely nail-biters once the voting starts), some members of Congress likely sized up the situation and decided that they need to be seen at least trying to push back against increased spending at a time of deeply troubling inflation.

Putin's entire goal for this war was to take out Ukraine as quickly as possible to avoid the inevitable sanctions.  Had he done that, had the Ukrainian people reacted passively towards the invaders, he would have secured his goal of changing Ukraine into a puppet state with little actual cost.

But instead, he failed miserably in that objective. He'll now have to deal with the consequences of a prolonged war, the cost to the Russian economy is already massive, and it will be even more so.Only reason why he's still in this is because declaring a loss would end him.So Putin doesn't want to admit defeat in Ukraine  so he'll sacrifice the economic future of his people, the lives of thousands of more Russian soldiers, in the hope that he'll outlast the Ukrainian military and their international allies.That is not a winning strategy.  One more thing, taking territory means nothing, they can take city after city but they will only hold it if Ukraine accepts a peace deal, and right now (and for the foreseeable future) there is little reason for Ukraine to accept any peace deal from Russia.

This is a major problem for Russia - even with all their oil and gas production - because basically the entire economy of Russia is built around oil industry, like 50-60%. Should Europe and the rest of the world start buying oil and gas from Ukraine in bulk, not only would it take a chunk out of Russia's political power over other nations, it could very well crash the whole economy. 
 
If you look at everything Putin's Russia has been doing, you'll see a pattern. For example, Russia has been very active in stirring unrest in Syria. Why? Because major oil pipelines to Europe from Middle-East go through Syria. Just last week we read that an envoy from Lebanon visited Russia. Why? Because some pipelines go through there as well, to oil ports. Now frozen Nordstream 2 was built to bypass certain East European countries to increase Russia's direct influence on Germany and put more pressure on said East European countries. Etc. Etc. Etc.
 
I'm not saying there isn't any truth in saying that Putin wants to build Russian/Soviet empire again. He probably wants that too. But Russia losing their ground on oil trade could well be an existential blow to Russia since instead of actually investing in their nation and people Putin and his cronies have just been bleeding the country dry.

Ukraine is taking losses but if the Wagner mercenaries are to be believed Russia needs hundreds of thousands more troops to successfully achieve their goals in the Donbass. Namely the encirclement of Ukrainian forces on the front.

That's probably true of ANY region (basically anywhere in the world). Crimea's been invaded and colonized and resettled dozens of times.

You could probably take a checkpoint of demographics of most of these countries every 100 years, and find a radically different makeup due to invasions and migrations.  So it's not JUST the Russian invasion of the last 100 years that's the problem.

The actual REAL horrible problem - is the promotion of intolerance, and rejection of multiculturalism. Which is a deliberate act by propagandists, prodded by power-hungry genocidal dictators.

You look at how close the Ukrainian and Russian people are, in terms of language and culture, and Russia has bent themselves over backwards to logically justify a genocide here, of what's essentially the same culture. 

I'd say both Ukraine and Russia are guilty of rejecting multiculturalism, (given Ukraine's ban of teaching Russian language as a 1st language) - but Ukrainian's act, here, is pretty forgivable and normal by modern standards. Russia's the one committing actual genocide.

And when you look at Russia's acts over the last 100-200+ years, you see a constant repeated pattern of genocide against various ethnic groups of neighbors. . . often multiple different ones simultaneously (Poles, Ukrainians, and several Siberian ethnic groups, in the case of the 1930's). 

This is what needs to change. Russian people need to accept that there are other races, ethnicities, religions, cultures, and languages in this world, and we are migrating and mixing and that every human being deserves security and opportunity, and a place to live, and nobody has the right to deprive them of that.  And we need to reject authoritarians who use propaganda to spread falsehoods and lies about other races, just so they can create an excuse to invade, murder and colonize - so they can steal property that belongs to other people.",1652192124.0,1652191935.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i81t57w,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

>Ms. Rudenko is a Ukrainian journalist and the chief editor of The Kyiv Independent.

So they solicited the opinion of a noted journalist in Kyiv for an opinion of what was happening in Ukraine, and then published what she wrote without injecting their own filters on top of it, and this disgusts you because she didn't have faith in Zelenskyy before the war, and I suppose you somehow knew better. 

Here she is three days later on Twitter:

>President Volodymyr Zelensky has made many really bad mistakes, and I’m sure will make many more, but today he’s showing himself worthy of the nation he’s leading.

Here she is *yesterday*, May 9. That piece is still following her around:

> “My op-ed was an honest analysis of him before the war,” she said. “I was, as everybody was, stunned by the metamorphosis of Zelensky.”

So maybe you could reconsider your opinion on Olga Rudenko and the NYT for having the temerity to publish something once that seemed true to someone at the time but now is not?

And you say I am working back from a conclusion?  Your premise is that all of this behaviour is ""irrational"", and therefore seeks to remove the possibility or even plausibility of reason.

Have you calculated the impact of an independent Ukraine, joining EU, and laying claim to these resources?   While the world is going 'green' and weaning itself off the carbon economy?  And what about Ukraine's heavy industry and advanced technology?  Where in Russia is the equivalent?    

So what, you say.  But you have to compare two alternative futures:  one is a future in which Ukraine is annexed to Russia, and the other in which Ukraine is an independent member of EU.  

This is a fight over territory - namely to retain Crimea.   Which is not really that important to a country which can't afford to have a major navy, and which could have peacefully continued to negotiate the use of the ports.

Both Russia and the USA both have a vested interest in influencing Ukrainian politics, so pointing to that influence alone provides little justification one way or another.  We have to also have at least a modicum of respect for the will of the Ukrainian public in this matter, independently of what the Evil Russians or Evil Americans are doing to ""manipulate"" that opinion through either positive or negative means.  You cite one, but not the other.

For example, you call the 2014 events a Coup, without citation of the events leading up to that event which put it into context.

We would have to go back to at least the 1991 decision by Ukraine's parliament to NOT ratify the CIS agreement with the former Soviet states to understand that Ukraine has held a long-standing wariness of joining its economic and security interests tightly to Russia.

This has been born out, step by step, by a gradual pivot of Ukraine away from Russian hegemony and toward an independent economic and foreign policy, with (at each step) Russia growing more and more alarmed and attempting more and more dramatic interventions to prevent this.  And each intervention failed, and further radicalized (or one could argue, nationalized) Ukraine in the process.

Fundamentally, the roots here are a historical conflict between Russia and Ukraine that is grounded in the inability of Russia to accept a Ukraine that is not in tight alliance with, and subservient to the interests of, the Russian state.  There are a large number of rational reasons for this, including access to the Black Sea, Ukrainian food production, and historically Ukraine's status as a key producer of military hardware.

But regardless of Russia's rational reasons for this, the fact is that Ukrainian nationalism has been growing since the 1990s to the alarm of Russia, and Russia's interventions have had the OPPOSITE impact of what they have desired  at each stage of this process.  You accuse the USA of ""instigating"" this shift.

Read my original comment.

I'm not dehumanising Ukrainians at all. I'm highlighting the fact that neo-nazism (call it ultra-nationalism if it makes you feel better) has been on the rise there since 2014. Everyone reported on it pretty consistently up until this year. Check the news stories from 2014 to this year for the terms neo-nazi and Ukraine and see for yourself. Now, everyone wants to rebrand these volunteers as ""patriots"". Check the Human Rights watch, Amnesty International, OSCE, UN or even local Kharkiv Human Rights Group reports on their activities and influence in the Ukrainian government and SBU. They all point to the danger they present to Ukrainian democracy. I don't think every Ukrainian is a neo-nazi btw, but their influence in Ukraine is considerable. How else do you explain the naming of dozens of streets around the country after nazi collaborators and the erection of statues to honour them? I'm from Ireland and we have zero streets or statues dedicated to nazis. Why does Ukraine?",False,1652180177.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i819qmh,,6,-5,0,-5,0,0,

The 2014 coup was absolutely a coup. It's the root cause of the conflict in Donbas and the annexation of Crimea. To deny that it was a coup or imply that it was in any way democratic is very misleading.

Whether Russia wants a subservient Ukraine is up for debate, they would definitely prefer a government that was friendly to them although that ship has sailed. That they absolutely oppose Ukraine having NATO weapons and bases on its territory is not.

Ukrainian nationalism or ultra-nationalism is a major issue and one that needs to be addressed. No country should have neo-nazi battalions in the official military, patrolling cities with the police, deciding military policy through the ministry of the interior or be renaming streets after nazi collaborators. And NATO countries should absolutely not be training and arming far-right extremists.

To argue that Russia is the instigator is to ignore all of their protestations about NATO for the last 30 years and all of the foreign interference in the government of Ukraine. The US has used Ukraine for its own purposes and is now willing to let them die to hurt Russia.

Regarding whether it was a coup vs a revolution, that's a matter of some debate as well.  Typically, we define a revolution as similar to a coup, but based on broad popular support rather than by a minority cabal of military or political figures.  The issue is that the cause of the unrest was a cascade of events.  First was the approval by the Ukrainian parliament by over 90%, of an economic alliance with Europe rather than the Russian Federation.  That was followed by Yanukovich's refusal to sign that agreement and intent to instead do the opposite.  This caused mass protests and in some cases to public violence by both pro and anti protestors, which led to a police crackdown.  The Police crackdown of November is widely seen as being a catalyst for shifting to broader protests and  riots.  These were exacerbated by the fact that Yanukovich initially refused to back down, and instead appeared to be accelerating the process of finalizing economic agreements with Russia.  This process appeared to escalate, with protests growing larger, foreign influence (including visits by US elected officials and coordination with Russian officials) increasing, violence increasing, and government response becoming more restrictive.  

It is true that Yanukovich in early 2014 began sounding a more conciliatory tone, but by then it would have been nearly impossible to prevent the government from falling.  Mass protests are notoriously hard to control once they reach that stage.  This clearly culminated in Yanukovich and many other leaders of his government fleeing Ukraine in early 2014, and the formation of a ""caretaker"" government by the Parliament.  Whether this meets the definition of a coup, a revolution, or a transfer of power depends on how you read the situation. 

This was followed by counter-protests in the South and East of Ukraine in support of the Yanukovich government.  Like the original protests, these also appear to have been heavily influenced by foreign powers.  Where the Maidan protests were encouraged by the West, these Anti-Maidan protests were encouraged by Russia.

The point of all this is that even this one small piece of the puzzle s a complex issue.  If I were to lay the blame here, I would lay it fully at the feet of Yanukovich's ham-fisted handling of the matter rather than with Russia or the USA attempting to influence the results.  To look at a situation where 90% of Parliament approves of an economic union with Europe, and turn around and announce publicly you are signing one with Russia instead, is a failure in representation in a spectacular fashion.  Had he backed down months before he did, he would likely have been able to maintain his government, but he was facing immense pressure from Russia (not to mention the economic factors with regard to money owed for Russian natural gas).  The real issue here is that Yanukovich tried to handle Ukraine's public the way that Putin and Lukashenko have more recently handled theirs, and he misjudged how strongly the public would react to this.",False,1652202036.0,t3_um9sio,t1_i82fk7u,,7,3,0,3,0,0,

Yes, he was friendly to Russia and considering their interests in the deal but he didn't refuse it. He just wanted better terms for all concerned parties. But the nature of Ukraine's nationalism is anti-Russian in many respects.

Peaceful protests turned ugly after right sector members and C14 began the violence. Leaked phone calls suggested that they were responsible for the sniper fire that killed both police and protesters. The ""caretaker"" government had far right white supremacists in it and was anti-Russian, moving to remove the law that recognised Russian as a state language. 

The US involvement is well documented with leaked calls where they discuss who they want in power. You had top US officials in Maidan spurring them on. 

You can't storm government buildings and take over the government in a democracy. That's not how it works. Yanukovich was an elected President. If they wanted change using neo-nazis and white-supremacists was not the way to go. It would be like arguing that the 6th Jan protesters in Washington were entitled to storm the Capitol building as an act of revolution. Like I said, that's not how it works. 

The protests that sprung up in Odessa, Crimea and across eastern Ukraine were not organised or influenced by the Russians. They were a response to the situation in Kyiv. Far-right extremists taking control of their government and ousting the president that they felt represented them. To say it was influenced by Russia takes away legitimacy from their voice. The response from the far right was ultimately to build private armies of football hooligans and neo-nazis and to arm them and send them to attack Russian speakers. Crimeans reached out to Russia as a response to the coup. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZkfCozBUPQ

In Odessa, far right members murdered 48 people by setting them on fire. Russian speakers had every right to be afraid of the new Kyiv regime.

I understand it's a complex issue with years or divisive history, but it's not helpful to deny the facts surrounding the situation in Ukraine. There is a serious problem with corruption, arms trafficking, neo-nazism, and anti-Russian policies. You could argue that what they have been attempting to do since the launch of the ATO in 2014 amounts to ethnic cleansing

Macron warned that while Europe was now helping Ukraine, there would come a point when Moscow and Kyiv would seek peace. And at that point, neither side should be humiliated or excluded as happened to Germany in 1918, he added.

Historians concur that the harsh conditions imposed on Germany by the Armistice of 11 November 1918 laid the ground for Hitler’s rise, which eventually led to World War II.

“We will have a peace to build tomorrow, let us never forget that,” Macron said, adding: “We will have to do this with Ukraine and Russia around the table. The end of the discussion and the negotiation will be set by Ukraine and Russia. But it will not be done in denial, nor in exclusion of each other, nor even in humiliation.”
