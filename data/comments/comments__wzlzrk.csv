Day 186 of my updates from Kharkiv.

I’m pretty sure today there was no shelling, but it’s kinda hard to say, because we had a very strong thunder almost the entire day here, and it could have masked any shelling that did happen. Actually right now, at 6am, there are some pretty loud explosions not that far away from me, and they sound a lot like shelling.

The missile strike today was *very* early, probably the earliest one they’ve done in a very long time. This time they fired missiles at 8:15pm, and they aimed at the center of the city again. Actually they aimed at the exact same place, as the missile strike from March 1st, the crater is even almost in the exact same spot, maybe a couple of meters off.

For whatever reason they targeted the same administration building from the start of the war, but right now it’s not open, so why hit it again? The doors and windows are even bricked off, you literally can’t go inside, it’s a useless target. Miraculously there were no casualties, even though it’s the center of the city, and it wasn’t the curfew yet either, it starts at 10pm, so there could have been a lot of people at that time, but thankfully nobody was there.

After searching for him frantically for two days, she finally found his body in a shallow pit next to a Russian military base.

>NAFO or the North Atlantic Fella Organization (a play on North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO) is an online group,[1] an internet meme,[2] and an online phenomenon,[3] dedicated to countering Russian propaganda and Russian disinformation during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In addition to posting pro-Ukraine memes, or ones mocking Russian war effort and strategy and ""shitposting"",[4] the group also raises funds for the Ukrainian military and other pro-Ukrainian causes.[3] The representation of a NAFO ""Fella"" is a Shiba Inu dog, often used as an avatar.

They have been so successful that pro-Russian accounts are now claiming that they are a CIA operation.

Earlier today (or yesterday, I can't keep my time zones straight), the Ukrainian Defense Ministry posted a thank you on Twitter to the NAFO Fellas for all of the good they are doing, which has gotten them a lot of attention.

Give guys who want to augment the TDF a rifle, LPVO/red dot, a few thousand rounds, and pay their tuition to go to these schools for a couple months. Ukraine has more western artillery rounds than it has cannons for. This is likely an international decision. Because they can chip cannons back to the US who can rebarrel them at their leisure, and give Ukraine new ones. It also gives Ukraine the option of using shells as bombs or mines if Russia manages a localized push. Send guys who dismantled similar bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan over to teach Ukraine to make them.

Since the younger generations in the Republic of Ireland have a genocidal attitude towards their diaspora in North America, basically demanding that those people discard their heritage, and recognize themselves as being only American or Canadian regardless of whether or not they are ethnically indigenous. Some of the more extremist Irish have taken to demanding all diasporas in North America abandon their heritage and appropriate the American and Canadian ethnic identity at the expense of the First nations. And since the US and Canada are like 40-50% decended from the Irish diaspora while being Ukraine's biggest supporters, military aged people from the Nazi side of the Irish border should be extradited to Ukraine for conscription.",False,1661700262.0,t3_wzlzrk,t1_im3xiok,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were around 20 kilotons.  Typical US and Soviet service missiles are 25 *megatons*, with a lot lying around out of service in the 1-10 megaton range.  Both the US and Russia built proof-of-concept devices much greater than this, that couldn't even be tested with a uranium casing.  There's a reason we don't test anything above ground anymore.  

You need little more than a dozen modern-yield warheads or a hundred from the 80s to detonate at the same time to cause catastrophic and potentially irreversible climate change.  In this scenario we'd halve the plankton population in oceans, destroy two-thirds of the ozone layer, cause unimaginable food shortages at the antipodes of the strike, and cool the planet by up to 10 degrees centigrade.  Thousands of species and millions of people would die, maybe a billion more from starvation and cancer.  Incidentally that cancer would *not* be caused by radiation from the blasts, except around the blast sites; it would come from UV radiation trickling through an atmosphere with no fucking ozone layer.  This would be from less than half a percent of the total weapons that exist.  It really does not take much.  

These weapons simply *must never be used*.  It should be a capital crime to even suggest putting more money into their construction or their research.  If we as a mob had a collective brain worth a damn, we would tear to shreds any elected official who didn't work to dismantle the entire nuclear arsenal at their disposal within their first 30 days of office.

\- Russia’s strategic positioning as a commodities exporter has irrevocably deteriorated, as it now deals from a position of weakness with the loss of its erstwhile main markets, and faces steep challenges executing a “pivot to Asia” with non-fungible exports such as piped gas  
\- Despite some lingering leakiness, Russian imports have largely collapsed, and the country faces stark challenges securing crucial inputs, parts, and technology from hesitant trade partners, leading to widespread supply shortages within its domestic economy  
\- Despite Putin’s delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent; the hollowing out of Russia’s domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst  
\- As a result of the business retreat, Russia has lost companies representing \~40% of its GDP, reversing nearly all of three decades’ worth of foreign investment and buttressing unprecedented simultaneous capital and population flight in a mass exodus of Russia’s economic base  
\- Putin is resorting to patently unsustainable, dramatic fiscal and monetary intervention to smooth over these structural economic weaknesses, which has already sent his government budget into deficit for the first time in years and drained his foreign reserves even with high energy prices – and Kremlin finances are in much, much more dire straits than conventionally understood  
\- Russian domestic financial markets, as an indicator of both present conditions and future outlook, are the worst performing markets in the entire world this year despite strict capital controls, and have priced in sustained, persistent weakness within the economy with liquidity and credit contracting – in addition to Russia being substantively cut off from international financial markets, limiting its ability to tap into pools of capital needed for the revitalization of its crippled economy'

Now that we have smart meters the price is adjusted regularly and frankly most suppliers have good models now and the adjustment is fairly small if the unit prices stay the same.
