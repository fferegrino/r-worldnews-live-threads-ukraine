Day 431-433 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were pretty quiet here yet again, but mostly thanks to our air defense. During the last missile strike at least 1 missile was shot down in our region, though we don’t know what it was targeting. Sadly, many of the towns in Kharkiv oblast that are close to the frontline still continue to get shelled daily.

Right now, there are also reports of a Russian surveillance drone flying somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, and at the same time some of our cities are being attacked with Shaheds. Russians have been pretty active during this past week, they launched 2 “big” missile strikes and now they are attacking us with drones. They also hit Zaporizhzhia with S-300 missiles 2 hours ago, but we don’t know what was hit yet.

What’s pretty interesting is that in the last 3 days some partisans in Bryansk oblast managed to derail 2 trains with fuel and some chemicals pretty much back-to-back, which is incredibly impressive. At first Russians said that they didn’t need that fuel anyway (yeah, right), but then they tried and failed to stop more derailments from happening. Bizarrely on one of their talk shows they were also saying that the “terrorist act has failed” while simultaneously showing a burning derailed train in the background. If that’s what they call a failure, then I don’t even know what they would count as a success.",False,1683073594.0,t3_135aoq9,t3_135aoq9,,0,169,0,169,0,0,

Since last year, many have speculated about the next Ukrainian offensives. After the successful Kharkiv and Kherson operations, it was natural to look for the next potential Ukrainian campaign to recapture its territory from the invading Russians.

For some time, Ukrainian military planners have been preparing for these offensives. In a December interview with The Economist, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Valery Zaluzhny, described how “we have made all the calculations – how many tanks, artillery we need and so on… May the soldiers in the trenches forgive me, it’s more important to focus on the accumulation of resources now for the heavier battles that may begin next year.”

It appears that time is close at hand. Over winter and into the new year, Ukrainian training institutions have been preparing soldiers and leaders. Combat units have been undertaking collective training. Huge quantities of new equipment have been accepted, absorbed into the Ukrainian military and issued to units. New brigades have been formed, and logistics stockpiling has been taking place.

Recent articles have discussed the political importance of the coming Ukrainian offensives. The focus has often been about the consequences of failure. A recent article in The New York Times argued, “Without a decisive victory, Western support for Ukraine could weaken, and Kyiv could come under increasing pressure to enter serious negotiations to end or freeze the conflict.” But what might such a decisive victory look like?

In all the speculation there has been no clear explanations of the measures of success and failure, or how it might be perceived in Ukraine, Russia or in the West. Therefore, setting measures of success for the coming offensives will be an important method by which Ukraine, and others, might assess the impact of the offensives. There are many outcomes by which we could measure success, but four stand out.

The first is that Ukraine takes back large amounts of its territory. By achieving battlefield successes, after fighting through Russian obstacles, recapturing large parts of its territory and liberating Ukrainian citizens will be a crucial measure of success for the counter-offensives. If large parts of Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are recaptured, this would be an excellent outcome. And it would be a foundation for future operations to recapture Crimea and Donetsk.

A second measure of success will be if Ukraine captures or destroys large parts of the Russian forces in Ukraine. The Russians have to be beaten, and they must be seen to be beaten. A successful Ukrainian offensive will reduce the quantity of Russian forces that the Ukrainians have to fight. Such a success will also ensure sufficient Russian combat power is destroyed to prevent them conducting any follow-on offensives for the remainder of 2023.

A third important measure of success will be that Ukraine preserves sufficient forces to continue defending some areas and conducting subsequent offensives in others. While the Ukrainians will invest a significant part of their air and land combat power in this offensive, they will want to do so in a way that they avoid massive casualties. The degree to which Ukraine can inflict disproportionate destruction on the Russian forces will be an important measure of success.

Finally, not only must Ukraine achieve considerable tactical and operational success in its operations, the Ukrainian people, foreign leaders and populations must believe they have succeeded. Ongoing strategic communication from the Ukrainian government will be a vital part of telling the story about the offensives. The perception of success is essential to Ukrainian morale, and an indispensable element of sustaining physical and moral support from the West. It will also assist Ukraine in rejecting hollow Chinese “peace” overtures that would see an immoral freezing of the conflict to Russia’s (and China’s) immense benefit.

Much has been sacrificed by the Ukrainians to arrive at this point of the war. Ukrainian civilians have endured endless missile and drone attacks, have seen their cities obliterated, and their fellow citizens tortured, raped and wantonly killed by the Russians.

The Ukrainian armed forces have fought on the land, in the air, at sea and in the information domain – and suffered tens of thousands of casualties. Through it all, they have not wavered, nor have they backed away from the agonising choices required to defend some areas, cede ground in others, while also building up their forces for this coming offensive.

The success of this Ukrainian campaign may not just determine the level of support from Western nations. Depending on the degree to which they achieve success, it may well provide a foundation for Ukrainian victory. A massive wave of steel and fire will shortly be unleashed on the Russians to give the Ukrainians the best chance of achieving this.",False,1683009114.0,t3_135aoq9,t3_135aoq9,,0,89,0,89,0,0,

He started the war in Donbas by his own admission (""I was the one who pulled the trigger of this war"") back in 2014 and is responsible for the deaths of 10,000s of people, including the people on MH17.

But when it comes to military assessment as well as the political ramification of it he is sometimes correct, especially in reference to the latest UNGA voting where Russia experienced her worst political defeat in the history of the UNGA. Girkin openly attacks Putin and makes him responsible for the political (and previously the military) blunders. Check out the picture showing his translated statement.

The only reason why Girkin is still alive are his connections to the GRU as well as his relative fame among the so-called ""Novo-Rossiya"" community. As a GRU-colonel he enjoys certain privileges other (non-intelligence community) Russians cannot even dream of. But everything has limits. So I wouldn't be surprised when news of his defenestration will go through the networks, soon.

The International Criminal Court has issued warrants on March 17 for the arrests of Lvova-Belova and her boss Vladimir Putin, who are charged with committing the war crime of illegally deporting and transferring children from Ukraine to Russia. Just last week the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe recognized the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia as genocide and “welcomed” the warrants issued for Putin and Lvova-Belova. 
>
>An interview with Lvova-Belova is a legitimate journalistic enterprise but there should have been red flags the moment the Russian government agreed to make her available to Vice. The Russian government has massively cracked down on independent journalists, recently jailing Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal correspondent. Why was it so willing to allow Vice to speak to Lvova-Belova? Did the Kremlin anticipate that she would be allowed to make her case to a Western audience? What could have been a unique opportunity for Vice to challenge Lvova-Belova became instead a platform for an alleged war criminal and an example of how journalism can be used as a tool of disinformation.
>
>Throughout the interview, she is permitted to position herself exactly as the Kremlin state media portrays her — a passionate humanitarian concerned about children’s rights. When Lvova-Belova tells Vice that Ukraine did not arrange humanitarian corridors from Mariupol, the reporter replies that “Ukraine disputes this claim,” missing an opportunity to remind Lvova-Belova — and Vice viewers — that Ukraine couldn’t establish any humanitarian corridors because Russia was relentlessly bombing civilian targets.
>
>The interview is an extraordinary example of how the right mix of naivety and complacency can turn a well-intentioned journalist into a messenger for an authoritarian state. Good journalism challenges lies with facts, presents information in context and, yes, listens to all sides but not uncritically. The Vice report fails on all of these fronts. Lvova-Belova’s lies go largely uncontested. Context is scarce. And the Ukrainian side is gestured at but isn’t called on to speak for itself. Vice was also loose with the facts. In a throwaway line in the text that accompanied the video interview, Vice accepted that Crimea was a part of Russia. It later issued a correction, acknowledging that “Crimea is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.”

And he said a lot of stuff I strongly disagreed with... And I LOVED it.

Before I say anything else, vote in 2024 like your life depends on it, and as much as it sucks that only one political party in the US is determined to continue aid to Ukraine, and protect the rights of women and minorities, that is the reality.

What follows is not an apology for the other party that won't guarantee those things, but merely to say that I appreciated an opposing argument that didn't threaten to burn democracy, baselessly call people pedophiles, or lie for shameless self-aggrandisement.

This gentleman simply had a different view on how to meet tomorrow's challenges, and it was well-reasoned, even though I disagreed, and I have to say that I've missed that. Since 2016 we've been robbed of that dialogue, and one of the lungs of American democracy has caught something real bad.

They were stating that Russia will occupy Ukraine in two weeks, and I wrote something to similar to this, that in two weeks Russians will understand what a grave mistake that have made by invading Ukraine, that its not easy to brake the spirit of those who fight for freedom!  
  
While Russian army , their soldiers are driven by looting Ukrainian homes, Ukrainian soldiers are driven by freedom.  
  
Those who loot , that will never win a war against those who fight for their freedom, and even if they do it will be similar to Pyrros victory over the Roman Army, no one left to celebrate!  
  
Unfortunately this war will last for a while, while Putin is alive war will not end. Russia its a country that does not accept defeats. It took about three different leaders to take power in Russia before they withdrew from Afghanistan.  
  
It will be the same with Ukraine, maybe not three different leaders, but at least while Putin is alive, the war will continue. When he dies, there will be a chance for peace with the new Russian leader.  
  
This war while Putin is alive can only end of Ukrainians surrender, this is something that will never happen, to many people have died, and the situation for Ukrainians has reached a point with no return, SURRENDER OR DIE, these are the only choices left Ukrainians. And Ukrainians will rather die for their freedom than surrender to this barbaric neofasist hord.

The totals read sort of what you might expect a decent-sized country's entire military to consist of.  It's crazy to think how much all the equipment costs, how much space that number of vehicles would take up...

I ran some numbers for that last point.  To simplify, imagine all 3701 tanks were T-72...

The T-72 is 9.53m (31ft 3in) long (from rear of the hull to the tip of the gun), and 3.59m (11ft 9in) wide.  Putting 3701 of them end-to-end would create a line 35.27km (21.91 miles) long.  It would take the average person around 7.3 hours to walk that distance (one mile every 20 minutes, assuming you could sustain that pace for that long).

An American Football field is roughly 5350m^(2) (1.322 acres), and you could fit 143x T-72 tanks in that space.  Therefore you would need 26x American Football fields of space to store all those T-72 tanks (though the 26th would only be around 88% full).  26x fields occupies 139,100m^(2) (34.372 acres).  ~~That's an area bigger than the Scottish capital city of Edinburgh (125km~~~~^(2)~~~~).~~  **EDIT:**  scored out some bullshit I wrote because I was confused about stuff.  26 football fields is not bigger than Edinburgh but it's still a lot of space.

A single T-72 weighs around 45 metric tonnes (around 49 short tons), depending on the version.  3701 of them therefore weighs 166,545 metric tonnes (181,349 short tons).  An African Elephant weighs around 6 tonnes (adult male), so that's around 27,757 elephants worth of weight in destroyed tanks.  The Eiffel Tower was constructed from around 7,341.21 metric tonnes of metal, so that's around 22.68 Eiffel Towers worth of T-72 tanks destroyed.  I was going to compare it to ships but I don't understand all the different tonnage terms for ships.

Also - a T-72 tank has a crew of three.  3701 of them destroyed would therefore mean potentially a loss of 11,103 lives (assuming all were fully-crewed and the hull of the tank was destroyed, not just rendered immobile/incapable of firing).  That would put tank crew casualties as being around 5.8% of all personnel losses by Russia during this conflict.  11,103 is also a larger population than the town I was born in / grew up in.

And that's JUST the tanks.  Doesn't include the APVs, trucks, etc.

Russia threw ALL THIS SHIT towards Ukraine, for a projected THREE DAY war, and they're STILL losing, over a year later.

Russia - take the hint.  Take the L.  Go home.  You wanna fight someone?  Fight Putin, and then put someone in charge in Russia who gives more of a shit about the health, wealth, and happiness of the Russian people than they do about the size of their bank account, the height of their platform shoes, the length of their conference room tables, or invading sovereign nations.",1683038711.0,1683029922.0,t3_135aoq9,t1_jij29v1,,1,31,0,31,0,0,

I doubt this person was a reporter. And if so, I doubt they've received even a second of training to be a reporter. Even the bottom 10% of the profession knows not to construct a question like this.

For example:

Reporter: ""You've said in the past that you don't support unlimited aid....etc etc....how will this affect your policies going forward?""

versus.

Reporter: ""We know for a fact that you don't support unlimited aid.....etc etc.....when will you be cutting off Ukraine?""


These are two entirely different scenarios that look similar but are not. The first question falls back on factual statements made by the subject in the past. The question brings up factual information to ask follow up questions. The second question is a loaded/directed falsehood designed to try and control the answer given.

Any real reporter knows even the basics of avoiding putting words into an interview subject's mouth, so to speak. And the second question here would be something asked by a propagandist.

Since the original 3 day operation and subsequent mobilisations failed the russian calculus has been pretty simple- buy time, draw this out and make it as ugly and messy as possible to try encourage a ceasefire in a strategically advantageous position- its clear to Putin, now, that his army is horribly horribly unfit for purpose, he needs time to fix it, and he needs an outcome ambiguous enough that he can present it to the russian people as a victory.

His opponent at this point is not really ukraine, its russian society. If he pulls out and admits that this has been a ghastly, humiliating failure, he probably won't survive- his position relies on him being able to project an image as a powerful strongman able to advance Russia's interests. So as long as he had mobik lives to spend, he'll spend them, because he's calculating russian society will accept that more readily than they'll accept failure.

If Ukraine lost more people than they were hoping to defending Bakhmut, then that moves the needle towards the ""bad call"" side. Or if it ends up hamstringing their ability to take large swaths of occupied territory this summer because too many of their elite units are too beaten up from defending Bakhmut, then that would also make it less great of a decision. Abandoning Bakhmut could have meant that Ukraine would have seen its whole line roll up all the way to Sloviansk, or it might not have. But even that could potentially be an acceptable result if it enables them to use more men in a recapture of Melitopol and Mariupol.

We just don't know if this is worth it until we see how deep they can punch this spring/summer. The fact that Russia took egregious losses doesn't make it worth it on its own, because Russia can replace those losses.

The seal between the ocean and the missile tube, the seal between the missile tube and the crew compartment, and finally - and most explosively - the seals between the reactive parts of the rocket fuel.

Russian/Soviet subs have a long history of spontaneous detonation of missiles in the tubes when the nitric acid eats the seals between the rocket fuel tanks, and the rocket fuel components mix and detonate.

Here's a small quote from that article:  
>The Russian foreign agent law[a] requires anyone who receives ""support"" from outside Russia or is under ""influence"" from outside Russia to register and declare themselves as ""foreign agents"".[1] Once registered, they are subject to additional audits and are obliged to mark all their publications with a 24-word disclaimer saying that they are being distributed by a ""foreign agent"".[2] The phrase ""foreign agent"" (Russian: иностранный агент) in Russian has strong associations with Cold War-era espionage.

In the past when Putin has been asked about his belief that Russia could succesfully occupy a large country when the West hasn't succeeded at it despite greater resources and military capability has repeatedly said it's an issue of will.  That the West isn't willing to do what's necessary to succeed in an occupation.

There are two ways to beat an insurgency - convince everyone that your governance is fine - or - kill everyone, including the population that insurgents must hide in.

Russia went into Ukraine with a plan for a mix of ""kill everyone"" and the historic Russian and Soviet practice of mass deportation of minority ethnic groups to Siberia, with forced repopulation by Russians.

>After the conversations I had at the Ramstein forum, though, it was hard to fault Milley for being pessimistic. Various Western officials, both military and civilian, worried aloud about Ukraine’s spring offensive. Russia has built a web of trenches so massive, they can be seen from space. Any military analyst will tell you that taking territory is a far costlier proposition than defending it, but the chatter at Ramstein was that Ukraine was about to walk into a buzzsaw. If Ukraine attacked to the southeast toward the Azov Sea, as has been widely and publicly speculated, aiming to retake Melitopol and cut Russian supply lines between Crimea and mainland Russia, the country would be going after some of the most heavily fortified—and most strategically important—Russian installations. This breaching operation, as it is known in the military, is one of the hardest and bloodiest maneuvers to pull off in general, and the Ukrainians have already been bled for over a year of brutal fighting. One Ukrainian journalist approached me on the patio at Ramstein and, wringing his hands, asked me what the talk was in Washington. What would run out first, he wondered aloud, America’s appetite to support Ukraine—or Ukrainian men of military age? Because the latter scenario, he added, was fast approaching.  

She went on to write:  
>Most reporting has focused on astronomical Russian casualties, but some U.S. officials have estimated that Ukraine has lost some 200,000 soldiers to death and injury in the last 14 months. The fighting ahead would be even bloodier. The U.S. military generally prepares for a casualty ratio of 3:1 when planning a breaching operation, with the attacking side bearing the brunt of the bloodshed. But one official at Ramstein told me it might be even worse: 50,000 Ukrainian casualties in the first two months alone. Another speculated that half of both armies in the area of the offensive would be wiped out in a matter of months. And would Ukraine even succeed? Everyone hoped so, but the jitters were palpable. “I’m looking forward to the next meeting [of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group] in June when we have some results from the Ukrainian offensive,” the European official told me.  

She also spoke to General Milley:  
>“Of course, we want Ukraine to win,” he went on. “We’re not sinking billions upon billions upon billions of dollars in Ukraine just to think otherwise. We want them to win. They must win. And we are going to do everything we need to do to help them win because the purpose is so important to the United States and NATO and Europe.”

>“In their 1991 borders?” I asked.

>“That’s a great question,” Milley stalled. “And the answer is that the borders of Ukraine will be determined by the Ukrainians. It’s not for us to say what the borders of Ukraine are. If they want to determine that through a negotiation, fine. But the bottom line is we are going to help Ukraine until that end state is met. That’s what our president has said and that’s what our military does—to help them, to train, advise, assist, provide military equipment, et cetera, to make sure that they have the wherewithal, the means of achieving that success.”

Ground forces of Russia were 415k in active service at the end of the April. UK estimate of 97% gives 402k. Pretty consistent with what Ukraine was saying. However all those units are not in Ukraine, but under regional command - which includes area like Belgorod. Also US were estimating that in any given time since November there were around 50k Wagnerities fighting around Bakhmut and Soledar. 
I would say that 70k total in that area was pretty spot on. 80k were assigned for Crimea direction, part of them were engineering. That's 150k already. Svatove Kreminna line - there are constant changes, but recent reports are talking about 35-45k in that area.

Crimean order of battle is 63k military servicemen, however at that time I still don't know why are you assuming the construction  of Russian brigade is 1:2 fighting vs support. No. Mech Brigade usually has 1 logistics battalion and other support companies in total strength of another battalion.

- 48 brigades
-122 regiments
- 95 separate battalions
- 50 other detachments of battalion level


We know about this document, because it made a stir in command structures, as it lists in total 655 battalions (396.2k soldiers), however tanks and APCs enough only for 202. Hence the decision of using mostly infantry and artillery to assault Ukrainian positions. It also agrees with Kyrylo Budanov assessment of 326k RU soldiers in Ukraine.

It now lists a total of 1 brigade in reserve that's left in their original base od operation. And last but not least - district north and central. Again - they have single brigade of line soldiers left. Everything else is in Ukraine. As I said - total number of soldiers listed in each of those districts gives a total of 415k. We have to substract one brigade for each district. That leaves us at just under 400k. Which is pretty close to the amount from the article.

Parenthetically, Stop the Steal morons have unfortunately splashed undeserved mud on the concept of hand counting ballots by including the rhetoric in their insane conspiracy theories. 

The UK does a super job of ballot counting by hand, usually has results done in a prescribed four-hour window after the polling closes, and the UK isn't a small country population-wise.

North Korea isnt a Chinese ally, on the contrary, its simply a geopolitical instrument useful for China on that part of its border. North Korea is....tolerated by China.

Xi and China dont care about Russia or Putin at all. And they also know they cant change Russia in a North Korea. Regardless of how weak it is. But they do measure how certain changes would affect China's standing.

Where Russia tries to change the global order through chaos, China does it gradually. And a too weak Russia that completely lost this war would harm that goal for China.

The moment Russia stands to lose this war I think thats the moment where Chinese support for Russia becomes more open. Dont get me wrong, they didnt want this war, at least not now. Regardless now its here they need to keep this conflict frozen somehow. Thats what would serve China most in Xi's view.",False,1683066372.0,t3_135aoq9,t1_jime531,,8,6,0,6,0,0,

Additionally right now the European NATO countries are kind of soft on China and China likes that.

That…was a Herculean effort that was exponentially harder than Desert Storm. The only reason the Allies were able to do that to the Germans was a prolonged strategic bombing campaign that systematically degraded the Luftwaffe by targeting German cities and its industrial base. It took over a year and was backed by the full industrial might of the United States churning out bombers and fighters by the thousands. The logistics of the Allied air campaign over Germany were mind boggling. Even then, Germany didn’t pull its fighters back until after Big Week in February of 1944. Ukraine has nowhere close to the resources that such a campaign would require and to attempt it would result in the PSU becoming so rapidly degraded that it would become combat ineffective within a couple of days.
