Day 408-409 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was a bit less quiet than usual here during the last 2 days. Yesterday the day started with a strong rain that was accompanied by thunder, which, as we found out during this war, sounds exactly like explosions. Because of that people were reporting hearing explosions in Kharkiv oblast, which turned out to be just thunder.

The thunder wasn’t the only thing that happened yesterday, as a bit after midnight there was a missile launch from Belgorod. We don’t know how many missiles were launched, but we heard just a single explosion here in Kharkiv, and apparently despite it being pretty damn loud, it wasn’t even audible in some districts of the city. 

It sounded very loud in my district, but many people from other districts said that they didn't hear any explosion at all. There was no real follow up to that story, some people speculated that some hotel might have been hit nearby, and that it might have been a missile launched by a jet, but nothing official. I also don’t understand why they would only fire a single missile, but they also did the exact same thing not that long ago, when they hit a school for deaf children less than 1km away from me with just 1 missile. After that there were no other missile strikes, so thankfully today the day was mostly uneventful.",False,1680997058.0,t3_12fas7b,t3_12fas7b,,0,113,0,113,0,0,

Russia’s campaign to severely degrade Ukraine’s unified energy system (UES) within the 2022-23 winter has highly likely failed. Russia has conducted long range strikes since October 2022, but large-scale attacks have become rare since early March 2023.

Smaller scale strikes (with fewer than 25 munitions) continue, but are highly likely having much less impact on the UES.

Ukraine’s network operating companies continue to source replacement transformers and other critical components. Transporting and installing these components is a major logistical challenge, especially high voltage transformers which weigh at least 100 tonnes.

Ukraine’s energy situation will likely improve with the arrival of warmer weather. Planning and preparations for next winter have likely already begun.

He is charged with violating the rules of statutory relations and the attempted murder of another soldier and co-participant in the Special Military Operation. According to the Investigative Committee, the Ingushetia native shot his younger brother's former commander in the face in the belief that the commander sent his brother to his death. The defense claims that the defendant was not of the sound mind due to his close relative's recent death. However a medical expert established the opposite.

> According to the criminal case investigated by the Military Investigation Department of the Black Sea Fleet Investigative Committee, the incident occurred in Mariupol. 29-year-old sergeant Ismail Dzangiev was the deputy platoon commander of the first platoon of a Battalion Tactical Group. Together with his 20-year-old brother Zelimhan, who served in the second platoon, he participated in the Operation since the very beginning. 
> 
> According to preliminary data, in March of last year their unit was ambushed. While trying to escape , Zelimhan Dzangiev and several other servicemen were killed.

> After the battle the older brother went to mount his own search for his brother. Unable to find him, he blamed the commander of the second platoon, the senior sergeant Ian Larionov, for all the troubles, when the victim could not clearly explain where his subordinates had been.

> After a quarrel, Dzangiev fired his side arm into the face of the Sr Sergeant, then continued searching for his brother. The latter was found dead. The sergeant, despite the severity of the injury, was saved by the doctors.

6869398b24eb1312b560eee01a166b18,12fas7b,jffewqh,"OK... It's been a while since I did a chunky post...

I've had a bit of time to go over all of the force disposition estimates from folks like JominiW... Keep in mind this is all subjective assessment and based on publicly available info. It's speculative prediction, not facts.

This is based on current estimates, things will change between now and whenever Ukraine decides to march. The other thing to consider - I'm doing this from half a world away, I don't know the ground apart from what I can see on maps, maps do not always tell the whole story.

So please keep all this in mind as you read, this is armchair generaling at its worst.

I hope you enjoy.


**Current Situation**

Ukraine likely has 4-6 Combat Brigades (3-5k troops each) training/trained for offensive actions. Maybe up to 4 would be fairly well equipped with Allied kit. Potentially upto a total of 9 with various kit.

I'm assuming at least 2 kitted out with good gear, others be as they may.

Russia has a heavy concentration of forces in the East, with some in the South, including a decent 2nd line of reserve elements.

The goal for Ukraine is likely to be a sustainable offensive to retake and hold significant portions of the South, with strategic consequences for the whole South and Crimea. The alternative would be to break the lines in the East (very unlikely). The South is the most likely theatre for any wide-scale offensive actions but will need firm ground.


**A Potential Offensive Option**

The two weak points in the Southern lines are likely to be from Orikhiv to Tokmak and Poltavka to Komysh Zorria. These routes bypass the concentration of reserve elements in the centre of the theatre, to the East of Tokmak.

*Stage 1.* RIF (Recon in Force) 1 Brigade (kitted), 1 other Brigade in reserve Orikhiv to Tokmak, primary focus is to tie forces down and shape a response from the Reserves and capitalise on things as able.

*Stage 2.* Not necessarily possible, but Battalion plus amphib or concentrated SOF effort in the rear areas to the SW of Vasylivka. This will further incentivise a response from potential reserve forces for the RIF.

*Stage 3.* After a time, 1 Brigade (kitted) and 1 other Brigade hit hard, fast and methodically to Komysh Zorria. Preferably another Brigade in reserve to rotate/secure flanks (likely response from the West if any).


**Potential Outcomes**

Russian forces would be required to respond to 2 threatening advances but would be unlikely to know which to focus on. In the event they focus one, the other has good chances to succeed. The 6th potential Brigade could be used to maximise this advantage.

Most Russian forces in the Southern theatre would be exposed and further stages of attack by Ukraine would need to be adjusted to the conditions.

This type of attack could potentially cut off many GLOC to areas further South, including Crimea. This could cause local or wider collapses amongst Russian forces but they could also effectively withdraw to better positions further South.


**Wrap-up**

This is speculation. This is complete armchairing, I would expect Ukraine not to do this, but to do something that suits the actual conditions on the ground, not what we can see or theorise from afar.

BUT with their potential 4-6-9 Brigades, they have the potential to create this type of situation (two threatening avenues of advance). Allied equipment is much better (optics) in the open spaces in the South, giving them further advantage, and the ability to really screw with Russia's mobility elements.

Russia as she stands now, is in a really precarious position in the South, and if they pull forces from the East to plug the gap, it's creates other gaps.

I firmly believe the South will be Ukraine's focus, it's just too much of an opportunity. However, it will need firm ground, so we're talking 5+ weeks IMO.

I hope you folks enjoy it, this is just a short write-up of the sort of potential there is in the South.

NB: I've got many things right before but also a few wrong and this is more specific than I usually like to do, I just saw Russian force dispositions in the South and was shocked.

https://nyti.ms/4199KuO

> WASHINGTON — A trove of leaked Pentagon documents reveals how deeply Russia’s security and intelligence services have been penetrated by the United States, demonstrating Washington’s ability to warn Ukraine about planned strikes and providing an assessment of the strength of Moscow’s war machine.

> The documents paint a portrait of a depleted Russian military that is struggling in its war in Ukraine and of a military apparatus that is deeply compromised. They contain daily real-time warnings to American intelligence agencies on the timing of Moscow’s strikes and even its specific targets. Such intelligence has allowed the United States to pass on to Ukraine crucial information on how to defend itself.

> The documents lay bare the American assessment of a Ukrainian military that is also in dire straits. The documents, from late February and early March but found on social media sites in recent days, outline critical shortages of air defense munitions and discuss the gains being made by Russian troops around the eastern city of Bakhmut. The intelligence reports show that the United States also appears to be spying on Ukraine’s top military and political leaders, a reflection of Washington’s struggle to get a clear view of Ukraine’s fighting strategies.

> The material reinforces an idea that intelligence officials have long acknowledged: The United States has a clearer understanding of Russian military operations than it does of Ukrainian planning. Intelligence collection is often difficult and sometimes wrong, but the trove of documents offers perhaps the most complete picture yet of the inner workings of the largest land war in Europe in decades.

The more alarming one is the S-300P running out since that in theory should allow for higher level bombing runs and also air superiority missions into Ukraine by Russia. However, S-300V (SA-12) is still available until end 2024. So there is no gap there. However, Buk running out is indeed concerning because there are no good immediate replacements for it. Potentially one can use manpads such as Stingers as mitigations but these are not as capable.

So overall, potentially more low level bombing runs can go through until more suitable replacements are in field. Overall the AA picture is concerning but not dire. So long as Russia is forced to fly low, it is somewhat ok, not good but a manageable situation, as bad as it is.

Artificial nitrogen fertiliser is made from natural gas. When the price of natural gas gets too high the manufacturers stop producing the fertiliser. That makes the price rocket up even higher and farmers cannot afford it, which in turn causes food shortages.  

Weaponising the grain shipments and fertiliser production is having an effect on some southern nations who depend upon both the grain and fertiliser. I recall a diplomat saying that one nation has had to subsidise the fertiliser costs for farmers to try and prevent food shortages. They're struggling to subsidise those costs.  

That diplomat said climate change is not only real but it is effecting some southern nations already. That makes it even more difficult to grow and harvest crops.  

China exploits this though their Belt and Road scheme. Southern nations depend upon outside investments. As such they cannot afford to annoy China, which means they are in an incredibly difficult position when it comes to UN votes condemning Russia's actions. Yes, they'd like to vote against Russia but they don't want to loose the Chinese investments.  

The diplomat said that they know they are selling their children's future to China, but they have no choice as they desperately need that money. He was begging for western support as he'd much rather work with the west than sell their children's future to China.  

On top of that is the national security risks involved with working with China. Just look at the uproar from the western military intelligence sectors when anyone suggests using Chinese equipment and business partners for critical telecoms infrastructure.  

I'm from a farming background here in the UK. Farmers here will complain loudly when natural gas prices go up and price them out of the much needed fertiliser market. Fertiliser is like gold dust to farmers. If it can be too costly here, just think what it's like in southern nations where resources may be even tighter.

Ukraine was making significant headway there before mud season hit last fall. And Russia mostly hung onto it by dumping mobiks into the area faster than Ukraine could take them out without heavy vehicle support. I won't be surprised if an armor brigade is used to break that line, it's just too useful.

There were rumors of at least 12 brigades being trained abroad. Probably not all of them will be prepared, but they can serve as backup and replacement later in the offensive.

As you say the south is the hotspot for an offensive. It seems Ukraine has halt up offensive operations in Kremmina and a push there will result in heavy losses. Kremmina is defended by good russian troops, alogside with the remainings of the 3º army corp that operates the T90's. The south seems like more lightly defended and after the Vuhledar disaster those russian forces are probably lacking lots of equipment and proper fighting structure (two marines brigades were destroyed in Vuhledar, it takes time to get them in shape again).

The south is a primary objective bu i think that a good offensive will need some more pushes. They could try a breakthough or at least maintain a good pressure in the east to prevent redeployment of russian troops. Localized ukrainian counterattacks have been successful this past week in Avdiivka and Ukraine is also doing some good artillery suppresion in the east. Maybe, a push to destroy heavy infantry dependent forces like Wagnerites.

Another point that deserves pointing out is that Ukraine seems to be using tanks to destroy infantry. This is a tactic they've been very reluctant to use during the entire war but yesterday they did use tanks in Bakhmut and in some other small scale counterattacks. These actions were successful with apparently marginal losses so i assume Ukraine has properly shaped the battlefield.

We'll see how things go. This offensive needs to bring some major gains to the table. A grinding offensive with heavy attrition will not play in Ukraine's favor.

Yes, people are being dramatic for karma on CredibleDefense. There are two pages on the air defense situation with ""Courses of Action"" defined for near/mid/long term solutions with much of the content glossed over.

In the short term, the US is attempting to source more SA-10/11 ammo from partners. In the very short term, the US suggested limiting SA-10/11 usage to tactical aircraft i.e. stop using them against shahed drones and cruise missiles, to preserve frontline air defense capabilities. 

Most importantly, this particular document was dated Feb 23 and predicated on 3 more cruise missile strike waves during March based on the past patterns of Russian attacks (60-90 missiles each). Only one of these strike waves seems to have happened on March 9 with 81 missiles so the ammo expenditure should be much lower than projected. 

>However, Buk running out is indeed concerning because there are no good immediate replacements for it. Potentially one can use manpads such as Stingers as mitigations but these are not as capable.

bb77b23580a5a7844ecb46247d384eb3,12fas7b,jfhn541,"Yep. I think Vlad articulates the anxieties Ukraine must have right now.

However, I think he doesn’t give western leaders (with the possible exception of France) enough credit. The only right answer is very simple. Russia has two choices, leave or die in Ukraine. I think most western leaders have made that very clear.

Of course, Russia isn’t listening to that reality. However, most Western leaders also realise that is solely Russia’s problem. If Russia decides to die in Ukraine, they really will die in Ukraine.

What I get from Ukraine is the understandable uncertainty that Ukrainians must be feeling right now. While understandable, I think this anxiety is fairly unfounded.

Yes, there are some obvious Russians shills who are calling for ceasefire. These guys have no political power. The exceptions are those being propped by Russia like Orban or Luka, or are in a countries with a large anti-west sentiment like Brazil or South Africa.

These guys are irrelevant. They aren’t the ones supplying Ukraine with arms.

The next two of Vkad’s categories blend a bit for me. Basically what I see is concern that the west will leave Ukraine in a long, possibly never ending war against Russia.

This won’t happen for two reasons. 

The first is the West.

It is simply not in the wests interests to see this continue. This war isn’t going to turn into a small frozen conflict like Donbas 2014-2021. Ukraine has far too much weapons. The Ukrainian army is too powerful now. This conflict is eating Russia alive, and quite quickly too. Only 12 months ago, it was inconceivable that Russia could concede Crimea. There’s a good chance right now that Ukraine is the 2nd best land army in the World. Russia is at best the 4th.

This war is ALREADY far too big and destructive for it to be ignored. Thousands of casualties a day. In only 14 months Russia is approaching 3 times the deaths America suffered in the whole of Vietnam. It is hard to imagine this level of military disaster. Also, the rate of destruction is only limited by Ukraine’s capabilities, which are RISING.

This size and type of war is extremely expensive and draining, not just for Russia and Ukraine, but for the whole world. This war is negatively effecting the whole worlds economy and will continue to do so as long as it is happening.

The ONLY way to reduce the impact of this war from the west’s perspective is for Ukraine to kick Russia out quickly. The shorter this conflict lasts, the less it will cost everybody. Mark Miley said only a few days ago that the ongoing Pentagon budget would need to be DOUBLED if this war isn’t ended decisively. 

The ONLY sensible move is to give Ukraine the best weapons we can, which is what’s happening.

The West will ensure Ukraine will win, because it’s too expensive not to.

The second reason is Russia.

I think this is where I disagree with Vlad’s assessment. Russia is not a stable country right now. It’s economy is in free fall.  Its military is in shock and looks like it’s completely in chaos. It’s political structure is under extreme stress …to say the least.

There is not going to be any great mobilisation by Russia. Man power, maybe, but the 400k they currently want to mobilise is looking like a stretch, and it won’t be enough. 

As for this idea Russia is going to move to a war economy that can produce enough to sustain its current millitary effort …forget it. What Russia is producing right now is negligible, and it will stay that way because its economy is in free fall.

Russia is running though its stockpiles at an alarming rate. It’s does not have the ability to make significant amounts of equipment. Once those stock piles are gone - they’re gone.

Russia politics are unstable too. At some stage, sooner or later, Putin will be killed. He will be killed by the system he created. Putin isn’t Hitler, this isn’t a nationalistic crusade. For the most part, Putin sprung this war on an unsuspecting Russians public.

Too many oligarchs are losing their money. Too many Russians are losing their family members. The Russian propaganda is getting more and more bizzare. 

The cracks are getting bigger by the day.

So in all, I understand Ukraine’s, and Vlad’s, anxiety. Ukraine has a lot to be anxious about.

But no, the west will not waver in supplying what is needed.

Everyone wants Ukraine to win decisively, and soon.",1681002718.0,1680986588.0,t3_12fas7b,t1_jfh8e3w,,1,33,0,33,0,0,

Obviously photos don't capture all the dead, but I've been cautioning people ITT for months that the estimated 200k Russian war dead are likely to be exaggerated because that's literally what every party in a war always does. Every country that has ever fought a war has always over-counted enemy war dead in their public releases. 36k is a much more plausible number than the 200k figure we've been accepting as gospel.

The 200k casualty estimates may be generally on point, but it's highly unlikely that figure means actual dead. It's almost certainly counting Russian wounded. If it was anything close to 200,000 dead Russian soldiers, we would be seeing farm fields littered with hundreds of bodies every single day. Ukraine would eagerly publicize those photos every time because of the valuable effect on Russian morale it would have. We sometimes see photos like that, but only on occasions following especially heavy fighting in a particularly intense area.

The reality is that both sides aren't actually fighting very intensely everywhere at once. Most casualties are from random artillery exchanges and drone drops that kill a couple people at a time. Most of the destroyed vehicles did not have a full crew inside of them when they blew up. A vehicle hits a mine or gets nailed by a shell or ATGM, and the crew leaves. Or a vehicle gets stuck in mud or suffers a part breakdown, and a drone spots and calls in a strike on it later.

We're not talking about missiles that were shipped off to Iran that had to endure a multi-decade embargo. The US holds onto these missiles, and the manufacturers of the missiles is located in the United States.

AIM-7 Sparrows (the actual air-launched fighter missiles) are reportedly still in US inventory. Older aircraft that are still in inventory- the Hornet, Super Hornet, Eagle, and even some Vipers can still use them. 

Some might ask: Why keep them in inventory and maintain them? Because if we run low on AMRAAMs, then Sparrows are our fallback weapon. They are obsolete in a peer conflict, but they're better than nothing and our older planes can still use them.

Older AIM-9s are also still in inventory but are slowly being aged out as well. One very notable case was the old AIM-9C radar-guided Sidewinder that was developed for the F-8 Crusader back in the 1950's. The missiles weren't very good and were taken out of service.

Thirty years later the US Marine Corps took the stockpiled AIM-9Cs and converted them into AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missiles. These are all accounted for, however: the Marine Corps expended their entire stockpile of Sidearms by the early 2000's.

We can disregard the technical capabilities and geography.  Fighting the war in Rostov is an alternative to fighting a siege in Donetsk city or Sevastopol.  If Ukraine takes bridges over the Don the French can intrude again.  They can talk in Turkey about how much Russian territory Ukraine will give back.  They can discuss important topics like how ships that had Sevastopol as a home port will return to Ukraine's navy and the orderly transfer of crews.  

We should be talking about who will pay for rebuilding Ukraine.  As an American I can say i prefer not paying my taxes.  Best to not damage any cities if possible.  Of course the lives of people are more important than the cost of property damage.  Citizens in Rostov and citizens in Donetsk have roughly equal status as not being from my neighborhood.
