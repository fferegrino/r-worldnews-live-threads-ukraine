Day 273-274 of my updates from Kharkiv.

I wasn’t able to write my usual update yesterday because of the yet another big missile strike on our energy infrastructure. Kharkiv wasn’t even targeted this time (or maybe it was, but every missile that went here was shot down), but we still lost our electricity and everything else along with it. This was the longest blackout so far; it lasted for 26 hours here, from 2:30pm yesterday to 4:30pm today.

What sucks the most is that it’s not just electricity that stops during a blackout like this, but also water, heating and internet. Our building does not use gas, so we can’t even cook anything or boil water, and also because electricity is down you can’t even buy anything in a store unless you have physical money, as card readers don’t work even if the store has backup generators because the entire system is down. 

The real life saver for us was the portable/camping gas stove that uses small gas tanks for fuel, though we completely emptied the last gas tank we had. They (450ml gas tanks) only last for about 4 hours of continuous burning, which is completely fine when you only use them occasionally, but they don’t last if you use them non-stop like we did just now. So hopefully the next missile strike won’t come too soon and we would be able to deal with it better, or we won’t even have anything to eat/drink.

It also appears that a lot of people are still without electricity around the country. Something like 70% of people in Dnipro and Odesa are still without electricity, but it’s getting fixed pretty fast. What I fear is that with the speed that we are receiving new air defense now, there won’t be anything left to protect with it by the time we can “close the sky”.

Bleach is pretty effective to sanitize drinking water in an emergency. While there are a few specific pathogens that can survive bleach, like cryptosporidium or giardia, it does kill most pathogens found in water. 

The recommended ratio is two drops of normal 5-9% household bleach per liter.  Depending on water temperature you add the recommended amount of bleach and let it sit for 30 minutes to a day (it takes longer at colder temperatures,less than an hour if the water is like 25°C, 24 hours if the water is like 1°C.)

A big benefit of using bleach for emergency water treatment is that its possible to treat entire barrels or large tanks of water at a time without boiling massive amounts of water.

This ratio is equivalent to 5ppm chlorine which would be equivalent to about the chlorine level in a properly chlorinated swimming pool.

The best rechargeable battery technology in terms of energy per dollar is... surprisingly still the oldest - lead-acid: Despite all the progress of lithium-ion batteries and reduced prices, the most bang for buck is still the old school car battery.

The smallest one have around half a kWh of energy, then scaling up from there up to the big truck ones. So even a small one could easily provide you with multiple days of light and smartphone-charging, however, things like a heater or a hair dryer will drain it rapidly.

How do you make use of it? Get an inverter. Watch out that you get a ""true sine"" not a ""modified sine"" inverter, 300W is plenty for light, phones, laptop etc., anything over 1000W is ridiculous because it will rapidly drain the battery and probably destroy it in the medium term due to the excessive currents.

Further advantages: You can charge it with a car or motorcycle, charge it using a car battery charger when you have power or on a generator.

Biggest disadvantage: They are annoyingly heavy and bulky. That is the biggest advantage that lithium-ion cells have over lead-acid, energy density is higher. But lead-acid is way cheaper.

1. If you can't really heat anything. Make sure that everything is more or less closed to prevent heat from leaving or the cold easily get everywhere. Have everybody live/sleep in the smallest room make sure to vent the room regularly to prevent dying from carbon monoxide intoxication. So it can't be airtight everywhere. If it's airtight you may die while sleeping as you're not going to wake up.

2. Candles can be a great source of heat. Use a ceramic pot that can be used as radiator. If you don't do that, radiation will be transmitted to the walls and that won't make you feel warm.  https://www.instructables.com/Tea-Candle-and-Ceramic-Flower-Pot-Heater-Improved/

3. Remember if you burn something, you need to exchange the air regularly or leave a small gap in a door to let air in and out.

4. If you have NaOH or Крот https://ananas.kg/image/cache/catalog/5235-550x550.jpg. Mixing the dry stuff with water will cause an exothermic reaction.

1. Countries don't want to be in war. People of France, Norway, Poland or the US might not think Ukrainian suffering is bad enough to die for.

2. Russia has for years or decades tried to present itself as the ""victim"" of ""NATO aggression"" and having NATO countries join the war would make that narrative stronger which could create stronger anti-NATO/US movemements elsewhere, for instance in China/Taiwan or for the -stan countries in Central Asia.

3. A quick Russian defeat could create a backstabbing myth where Russia becomes even more dangerous.

4. If Russia seems like it might collapse, that might scare countries like China to join the war on Russia's side just to preserve Russia as an anti-USA focus point.

Perhaps they would ""generously"" take Ukraine under its protective wing and annex the country, so that any attack on Ukraine was an attack on Russian soil. Even though Russia has not pulled this card vis-à-vis the recent so-called annexations, in an (obviously) losing war with NATO we can't be sure what would happen. NATO intervention would of course also justify Russia's claim that NATO is an aggressive state actor and not a defensive coalition as Ukraine is not a part of NATO. They're still salty about a humanitarian intervention in Kosovo which put a stop to the antics of bunch of drunken Serbian sociopaths. I'm sure they can relate to those guys.

The channel is [Reporting from Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/@RFU), it has 138k subscribers and joined Youtube on 4 Mar 2022. YouTube gives the location of the channel as ""United States""

I have not encountered this channel before but looking across the titles of the other videos they all seem to be very pro-Ukrainian with click-bait style of titles. Emotive all-caps words like ""OBLITERATE"" ""UNLEASH"" ""DESTROY"" and ""BREACHED"" are used generously in the video titles to describe Ukrainian attacks on Russian forces. The regularly updated series are typically between 4 and 7 minutes long, so are very digestible.

A notable and very positive feature of the channel is the inclusion of an accompanying narrative at the top of the comments in the video synopsis, just below the list of ""Support me"" options. You will need to select ""Show more"" to this. Accompanying the video are subtitles which appear to be prepared and not automatic. This always enhances the viewing experience for me.

I haven't had a chance to look at the other videos except for [22 Nov: Ukrainians UNLEASH HIMARS On Russian Bases Again | War in Ukraine Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uFxCAs7Rto) which I recommend for watching to put the earlier video in some context, just overcome any reluctance induced by the high calorie click-bait title. The narrative of the video comes across as well researched and well informed, in fact the producer of the video identifies himself as being [from Mykolaiv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uFxCAs7Rto&t=266s). Sources for the content of the video aren't listed below the video but are referred to in the video narrative (e.g. ISW or a named government spokesperson.) What really stands out in this video is the use of graphical annotations to the map (arrows and arcs) to illustrate the direction and range of artillery or forces movements. Other channels do this but I feel this channel does it very well and clearly puts a lot of work into synchronising the visual narrative with the vocal.

If you allow for the unashamed bias of this channel I would recommend it as a valuable supplement to your other sources of information. Here is the link to the channel again.

Not exactly perfectly true, though not incorrect. Prior to the war, the US' yearly procurement orders across all branches of the military resulted in a yearly production of around 130,000 shells. In theory, surge production can pretty quickly double, and then triple it by going to full 24/7 production, but going beyond that won't be quick, as it takes standing up additional production lines and such.

The problem right now is throughput, the war in Ukraine is using a rate of ammunition not see anywhere in decades. So it's quicker to increase throughput by buying from ammunition factories already producing similar items than it is to build new lines entirely.

Easy to forget a decent amount goodwill toward the US internationally is a result of the Ukraine war and the US handling of it by being the adult in the room with the muscle to back it up.

2 Stability is most important. You create an uncontrolled power vacuum in a place like Russia and the ability to control or predict the situation become infinitely more complicated and difficult. Nuclear weapons are a major factor here. Also the likelihood of similar or worse retaliation on NATO personnel or assets is a major risk

3 The way to defeat Russia long term without Nuclear Armageddon is by protracted and comprehensive support and collective measures by intl community. In order to gain that support, must play by the rules enough to elicit goodwill and trust with the world beyond our Allies who will likely be ride or die anyway. Don't get me wrong, NATO is more than capable of taking Russia on militarily, but at what cost?

It pays to be reserved and responsible but also resolute and unwavering in response. The entire world is watching. Just my opinion.

Russia. Or, really, it was the Soviet Union, but this is its successor state.

Russia has been at war with NATO for around a decade now. We won't call it that because of the required response. But Russia has been influencing elections, attacking and taking strategic areas, and executing cyber attacks against NATO countries. And this is not even mentioning economic warfare by threatening EU energy supplies. 

Putin's puppet, Trump, who was possibly elected due to Russian influence, spent 4 years trying to find a way to dismantle NATO.

The most recent attack on Ukraine is another step in Russia's escalation of that war. Putin assumed that because NATO still had not acted to protect Western interests that they would let him have his way. If Putin had gotten Ukraine for free, he would have gotten back his best ports, his best factories, and his best workers, along with a wealth of natural resources and good access to the rest of the former Eastern Bloc. His original plan was to take Moldova too, remember. 

What do you think he would do with that power? If your answer is ""peacefully coexist with NATO"", you would be incorrect.

So NATO and EU countries introduced sanctions. And in response, Russia started stealing IPs. But Russia already had been stealing multinational assets, such as in the case of Sergei Magnitskiy back in 2014. Russian ally Belarus diverted an EU aircraft to abduct a journalist with Russia's backing. Russia, really, is attacking the foundation of the entire Western-centric power structure that NATO is designed to protect.

And so NATO and EU countries started giving weapons to Ukraine. Because they recognize that defending Ukraine is defending NATO. But if that's the case, and Russia's invasion is not only a genocide, but really an escalation of a ""cold war"" between Russia and NATO, then does it not perfectly fulfill NATO's stated purpose to intervene and end Russia as an effective power projector once and for all? Especially when doing so will save the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians? It is irrelevant that Ukraine is not a member of NATO. 

We are at war with Russia and have been for a while. NATO soldiers are not at risk in intervention.

The Ukrainians have the manpower to take their land back and secure their border quite quickly if they had direct fire support.",False,1669302907.0,t3_z39qj0,t1_ixma78g,,2,-2,0,-2,0,0,

One of the officials said the stockpiles of certain systems are “dwindling” after nearly nine months of sending supplies to Kyiv during the high-intensity war, as there’s “finite amount” of excess stocks which the US has available to send.

>Among the weapons systems where there’s particular concern about US stockpiles meeting Ukrainian demands are 155mm artillery ammunition and Stinger anti-aircraft shoulder-fired missiles, the sources said.

>Some sources also raised concerns about US production of additional weapons systems, including HARMs anti-radiation missiles, GMLRS surface-to-surface missiles and the portable Javelin anti-tank missiles – although the US has moved to ramp up production for those and other systems.

Diplomatically there is no conquering for Ukraine. They are the defending party. Ukraines diplomatic goals by force of arms is to do whatever they can to reclaim territory lost and prevent future loss. 

As far as ""where borders exist"" during war they don't exist. They are being ""negotiated"" on the battlefield right now and eventually will have to be codified at the conclusion of hostilities.

So let's assume for an extreme examples sake at the end of the conflict Ukraine has to move to Belgorod before Russia is willing to negotiate an end of the war.. Ukraine has two options at that table.. use the territory to gain advantages(such as we give this back but you don't put any forces x km from our border) or keep the territory since they are at a position of strength. This isn't a function of want because I highly doubt Ukraine as a nation wants any part of Russia.. but at THIS stage of the war ALL actions taken by Ukraine are to enhance the end of the war negotiation position. They would ABSOLUTELY wish to restore their territory via the table over the bullet and because of this EVERYTHING they do is to tip the scales in their favor to accomplish this. So while touching Russian territory isn't ideal.. it also isn't off the table if they feel it can help either. Right now it just isn't useful to that negotiation process nor is it a worthwhile expenditure of resources.

If Russia fights for every square foot of occupied territory though... well they will in that case likely try to continue to fight after the border is restored which generally means the conflict continues until a forced regime change, a dmz, or a continuation of the conflict until they do negotiate.",False,1669332425.0,t3_z39qj0,t1_ixo3pl9,,4,5,0,5,0,0,

Your argument in the above comment has two postulates. 

1) People are unable to read propaganda critically without falling victim to it
2) Engaging with it in any way increases the amount the algorithm will spread it

For the first, your argument relies on the idea that people are unable to read a sentence without agreeing with it. You’re displaying such a cynical view here with comments like the “unshakeable hive mind.” 

I again reject this premise in its entirety. People are actual human being capable of having multiple thoughts and ideas in their heads. There is no reason to protect them from an idea when you can instead show them why it’s wrong. It’s naive to assume people who are actively engaging in a Ukraine war focused subreddit aren’t coming across Russian propaganda on their own.

Giving people the tools to critically think about the propaganda is how you fight the propaganda. If you are unable to link actual sources, the ability to discuss it will hopelessly dissolve into straw-men based arguments. You either show the actual propaganda and arguments made in it or you don’t. Relying on straw-men arguments regarding it won’t be effective in the real world because actual propagandist aren’t straw-men.

Your second point has more merit. Yes, engaging with the propaganda will increase its prevalence because of the algorithm. However, it’s a trade off that is worth it. If we remove the effects of a piece of propaganda, it doesn’t matter how much it is spread. People will dismiss it.

However, as discussed above, if we instead close our eyes and pretend it doesn’t exist, it will still spread anyways. At least if we use it as a discussion for critical discourse,  the trade off of the spread has a net positive.",False,1669324594.0,t3_z39qj0,t1_ixnmlp9,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

I mean I litereally told you that Poland is using them to protect important places that are used to help Ukraine, Polish patriot systems are already busy.

Okay lets say that I would agree with you about Polish government using this whole situation  PR move against Germany, if this is true than yeah it would be absolutely horrible. But lets look at what Germany did from perespective of people who know what this system of capable, from prespective of people who dont know what it can achieve Germany offer was really good, but from perespective of people who know Germany offer was pretty much completly pointless since this system couldnt be used to save anyone in situation similar to the one that just happen(because after missile enters polish airspace its too late too react) so for those people Germany offer looks like Germany using Polish tragedy for PR, to make themselves look good in Poland and internationally. Thats how this situation looks from perespective of Polish people who know that this patriot system cannot protect Polish territory, unless Germany agree to shot down missles over Ukraine territory but that could potentially put Germany in position where they are accused of militarly helping Ukraine which means would make Germany part of this conflict, Of course Germany wouldnt agree to something like this(and to be fair most countries wouldnt agree to do this by themselves).",False,1669320299.0,t3_z39qj0,t1_ixncyne,,7,-1,0,-1,0,0,

My country has a big Russian population. I know more about Russia than you will in your lifetime. You are swallowing the Western perspective. It’s not wrong but it’s 100% a Western perspective and you cannot even hope to understand a country that is not Western from where you stand. There is no ideological drive in the war for the leadership. It’s geopolitics. Ukraine has been a matter of discussion as a territory for decades, before even the USSR dissolved. They want to destroy Ukrainian identity because they hope to replace it with a uniform Russian one, not because they necessarily care about Ukrainian culture. They are literally throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks because “geopolitics” doesn’t exactly get society behind a war.

Also we ended up where? Sure Europe is suffering economically but nothing too extreme for the moment. Ukraine is the one who is suffering but Ukraine and the EU or the West are not the same party. I don’t know how things would go if we would have done things differently and it’s awful what is happening in Ukraine but it is perfectly clear to me that all parties are following their best interests and I expect nothing less.

Yes, it was widely used to signify Ukraine as a territory (not specifically part of Russia btw) because the name of Ukraine was literally the name of the territory. It wasn’t because there was a hidden wish to subjugate the Ukrainians but simply because there was no Ukrainian nation state. It’s not that common anymore but “the” Ukraine is one hundred percent a Western invention. The West also saw Ukraine as a territory hence “the”.

Yes, I said I support a Marshal plan IF Russia was somehow occupied by NATO. Do you think the Marshal plan for Germany was bad?",False,1669314857.0,t3_z39qj0,t1_ixmwb12,,7,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Poland was the one which demanded NATO nations did something, so Germany made them an offer with the best they could do. Only idiots would look at that and go ""how can I use this for PR gain"" but that is what Poland did.
