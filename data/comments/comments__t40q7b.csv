These are the top developments of the past few hours:

‘Dozens’ of people have died in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv after heavy bombardment by Russian forces in the past 24 hours, according to local officials. Footage shows Grad missiles raining down on the city.

The international criminal court’s prosecutor has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Russia has assembled a military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for 40 miles, according to satellite images taken by a US company. A major assault on the Ukrainian capital has been expected for days.

The invasion has fallen behind schedule thanks to fierce Ukrainian resistance, and multiple equipment and logistics failures, according to a classified US briefing. The US also expects a “long and bloody battle” for Kyiv, US senator Chris Murphy said.

British prime minister Boris Johnson will fly to Nato’s border with Russia on Tuesday to meet leaders of Poland and Estonia, and British troops.

Disney has called off all upcoming theatrical releases in Russia, including Pixar film Turning Red, as international businesses continue to withdraw from Russia. Warner Bros and Sony are pulling The Batman and Morbius respectively.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN read aloud a text message exchange said to be between a Russian solider in Ukraine and his mother shortly before he was killed.

The US will expel 12 members of Russia’s UN mission, accusing them of having “abused their privileges” by engaging in espionage that is harmful to national security.

4ddfb6ecf8f5458381c17fc618767cb7,t40q7b,hyvs9hu,"Summary from CNN (source at the bottom)

Russian forces bombarded a residential area in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, with rockets on Monday — killing at least nine people. Russia also intensified its assault on the capital, Kyiv.

As Ukraine wakes to a sixth day of Russia's invasion, here's what you need to know if you're just joining us:

1. 40+ mile long convoy: New satellite images show a Russian military convoy that has reached the outskirts of Kyiv is more than 40 miles long. The convoy stretches from the Antonov airbase — roughly 27 kilometers (17 miles) from the center of Kyiv — to just north of Pribyrsk, near the Belarus border.
2. ""Second wave"" fears: US officials told lawmakers in classified briefings Monday that a second wave of Russian troops will likely overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings.
3. War crimes accusations: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of war crimes for bombing the city of Kharkiv. He said that in five days, 56 missile strikes and 113 cruise missiles were launched in Ukraine by Russian forces. On Monday, he said Russian forces ""brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime."" He has called for a ""complete closure of the sky"" for Russian aircraft and missiles.
4. Civilian deaths: Multiple officials told CNN they are concerned by the increase in violence, civilian casualties and indiscriminate killings in recent days. The UN said at least 406 civilians have been reported hurt or killed since the invasion, including at least 102 killed within the past few days. More than half a million refugees have fled Ukraine.
5. What came of the talks: Zelensky said he is analyzing the results of Monday's talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations at the Belarus border, which lasted five hours. Zelensky said: ""There can be fair negotiations if one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery at the time of negotiations.""
6. Sanctions bite: Russia scrambled to prevent financial meltdown Monday as its economy was slammed by a broadside of crushing Western sanctions imposed over the weekend. Putin held crisis talks with his top economic advisers after the ruble crashed to a record low against the US dollar.
7. Snake Island defenders: The Ukrainian forces of Snake Island in the Black Sea, who were initially feared dead, are “alive and well,” according to the Ukrainian Navy. A statement from the Navy said the soldiers on the island repelled two attacks by Russian forces but in the end were forced to surrender “due to the lack of ammunition.”
8. Sporting bodies punish Russia: FIFA and UEFA have banned Russian national football teams and clubs from competition, and World Rugby suspended Russia and Belarus from all international rugby and cross-border club activities. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation said it will not hold any events in Belarus this year.

>Reynolds: Do you really think he’ll use a nuclear weapon?

>Hill: The thing about Putin is, if he has an instrument, he wants to use it. Why have it if you can’t? He’s already used a nuclear weapon in some respects. Russian operatives poisoned Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium and turned him into a human dirty bomb and polonium was spread all around London at every spot that poor man visited. He died a horrible death as a result.

>The Russians have already used a weapons-grade nerve agent, Novichok. They’ve used it possibly several times, but for certain twice. Once in Salisbury, England, where it was rubbed all over the doorknob of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who actually didn’t die; but the nerve agent contaminated the city of Salisbury, and anybody else who came into contact with it got sickened. Novichok killed a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess, because the assassins stored it in a perfume bottle which was discarded into a charity donation box where it was found by Dawn Sturgis and her partner. There was enough nerve agent in that bottle to kill several thousand people. The second time was in Alexander Navalny’s underpants.

>So if anybody thinks that Putin wouldn’t use something that he’s got that is unusual and cruel, think again. Every time you think, “No, he wouldn’t, would he?” Well, yes, he would. And he wants us to know that, of course.

>**It’s not that we should be intimidated and scared. That’s exactly what he wants us to be. We have to prepare for those contingencies and figure out what is it that we’re going to do to head them off**.

Basically - yes there is a chance Putin would resort to something he has been leveraging for decades. He has proven to have previous disregard for life or morality. It's definitely not something you can rule out 100%.

But that (obvious) possibility isn't reason enough to panic to the point of detriment. Every logical person right now is scared to some degree, but we still have to manage it and face this situation confidently and constructively.

> **Three big military decisions the Ukrainians will have to make soon**, Mick Ryan
> 
> ...
>
> Ukrainian forces in the east are at risk of being surrounded, cut off and potentially destroyed in detail. Russian forces are advancing south from Kharkiv and north from Melitopol. Cutting off Ukrainian forces in an eastern pocket would be a significant gain for Russia, and a dangerous development for Ukraine.
> 
> Until what point will Ukraine retain the ability to withdraw its units before they are cut off by Russian forces? And if Ukraine is to save these units, it means ceding all Ukrainian land east of a Kharkiv-Dnipro-Melitopol line to Russia. This will be a difficult political decision for President Zelensky.
> 
> Big decision No.1 is this: at what point does Ukraine withdraw its military forces in the east to survive before they are cut off by Russian forces advancing from the south-east and north?
> 
> The Ukrainians must also continue to secure their western border. They must ensure the continued delivery of Western aid across these borders. Can, and will, the Russians deploy forces to interfere with these shipments? It would be an interesting development because it could introduce Russian targeting of third-party nations (maybe).
> 
> So big decision No.2 is this: should Ukraine commit forces to the west, and how much combat power can they afford to commit to this mission to pre-empt Russian interference?
> 
> Finally, the Ukrainian air force has fought well, but the Russians have so far taken a minimalist approach to air power. As British analyst Justin Bronk has pointed out, we have not seen the full might of the Russian air force. As the Russian campaign evolves, there may be greater use of air power. This will be designed to support ground forces but also deny Ukrainians the use of their airspace for crewed and uncrewed aircraft.
> 
> The final big decision. If the full weight of Russian air power is committed to this war (and it is considerable), what are the Ukrainian options for redeploying their airpower assets elsewhere so they can continue the fight?
> 
> The Russians, despite their missteps, have shown no willingness to halt their conquest of Ukraine. They have shown on previous operations the ability to learn and adapt, and failure can be a good teacher. The Ukrainians will also need to adapt if they are to continue defending their homeland.

Ukraine cuts off Russian phone numbers

Ukrainian telecommunication services have blocked access to telephones with Russian numbers to their networks, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.

""Communication is one of the key elements of effective combat operations,"" it posted on Telegram.

The ministry said Russian troops would probably take phones from Ukrainians once their own were cut off.

""We call on Ukrainians whose mobile phones have been confiscated by representatives of the enemy troops to inform the operator as soon as possible and ask them to block the stolen phone,"" it said.

""We understand that doing this when the phone is taken away is not an easy task. However, this is very important - find neighbours who have a phone, use a landline - it depends on the security of our state and the lives of Ukrainians.""",False,1646116835.0,t3_t40q7b,t3_t40q7b,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

And what is amazing to me, is I just met with a student who was completely anti-politics before this and actually had a very negative view of Putin.

However, after meeting her today, I noticed a complete 180. She started saying how after she thought about it, all the great things Putin has done and that this is all Natos fault. That she now realizes that the Ukranian's have been killing Russians in Crimea for the last 8 years. That NATO broke the rules first due to weapons placement, etc. etc. etc.

She does NOT believe that sanctions will be bad. She also says that Russia will not go bankrupt because they have so much gold so the sanctions aren't really an issue. She says she gets the majority of her info from RT, but that she also glances at some western speakers, although she couldn't name them. Not once did she agree with me that overall war was bad, that the war is illegal, that it was uncalled for, that it's sad people are dying. She only justified that Putin had no choice. Russia had no choice.

I am obviously hyper-aware of propaganda and I'm also aware enough to know I have cognitive-biases that if go unchecked will completely alter my thinking. But in thinking about the regular Russians, and this is a sweet lady, mother, and never been political. The immediate bandwagon effect and defensive ideas as Russia is slowly closed off from the world fascinated me.

While this war is truly awful and I can't wait to send Putin back to the stone age, I can't help but be angry that not only is the war causing human tragedy, but also the brainwashing of millions of people to rally toward a cause that is obviously black & white wrong.

At the end, I advised her that even if she doesn't think the sanctions will be that bad, that she should take her dollars out of the bank. She said she couldn't, because all the ATM's are empty.

I guess she will realize one way or another. Just a vent, because I care about her as a human and she is a sweet lady. But now, I just see her as a Putin apologist and someone who is drowning in a sea of propaganda and misinformation.",1646123679.0,1646119624.0,t3_t40q7b,t3_t40q7b,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

As far as I can tell, if you are worried about nuclear war or if you are speaking up about it a lot due to recent threats, read as much as you can about it. Information, even if it is scary, is always preferable over blind fear.

Several American ex officials, of course, are leaking out the top-heavy sentiment: we want to do the right thing.

For one, *we already have intervened*. Let me tell you something. If Ukraine continues to be subject to *war crimes*, an intervention is really the only moral, strategic, and **winning** option.

1.	NATO’s credibility as a vanguard power, as a defender of human rights, will be annihilated. They will be slowly isolated. They are a defender of human rights, with nukes.
2.	If the people who hold launch authority are convinced they have an off-ramp better than nuclear Armageddon, they will take it.
3.	Evil wins if they say “We have nuclear weapons.”

The West has credibility in issuance of pardon: they will see to it that those who prevent such acts from taking place are expressly forgiven, because while Putin may not have a future, there are many who will.

It may not toe the line, but I speak for people, more than a few, when I say: *we will live life being held hostage by crazy people, if we do not act.* A precedent will be laid. Non nuclear powers will run to produce their own nuclear weapons. NPT won’t be worth the paper it’s written on.

The mere threat of nuclear attack was an act of war! It was a crime against peace!

We spend hundreds of billions of dollars to defend our community, and we will sacrifice one who *has the stuff it takes?* 

“For the long term, for the long term!” They say. “The Ukranians must die, I’m afraid.” They say.

The Ukranians have the goods: you know it, I know it. We all know it.

Article: https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/02/28/politics/us-kyiv-fears/index.html

“Administration officials warned lawmakers in classified briefings Monday that a ""second wave"" of Russian troops will likely consolidate the country's positions within Ukraine and by sheer numbers be able to overcome the Ukrainian resistance, according to two people familiar with the briefings.

""That part was disheartening,"" one lawmaker told CNN.

The officials also said Russia was likely going to lay siege to Kyiv and predicted ugly scenes of urban warfare, one of the people familiar with the matter said.

And at the end of the day, officials tracking the campaign say, the ugly truth remains that Ukraine is massively outgunned and outmanned -- even as Russia has made what military strategists say are a number of obvious blunders.”",1646119131.0,1646118288.0,t3_t40q7b,t3_t40q7b,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

1. Immediate ceasefire and withdrawl of Russian troops back to Russia.  
2. Zelensky agrees to new elections and that he will not stand for re-election. The man is already a global hero and has done more for Ukraine than anyone. He has firmly aligned them with the west and given his people immeasurable hope. He looks like he as a beautiful family and he should be reunited with them to live a stress free life.  
3. Donbas is given semi autonomous status, but with clear demilitarisation rules and a UN peace keeping force of non European origin.  
4. Ukraine is allowed into the EEA, but not the full EU.  If it meets relevent criteria in the future it can apply to join the EU.  
5. Freeze on the Central Russian bank lifted and and reconnection to swift agreed.  
6. Other high tech and trade sanctions (including Pro Putin Oligarchs) remain and rolled back slowly over 2-3 years.

  
Item (1) ends the current senseless death on both sides.  
(2) Lets Putin claim some kind of victory. He has removed the head of state. The reality is that after the current crisis an election would yield a Zelensky loyalist with strong pro Europe ties anyway so would not ultimately impact the trajectory of the country.  
(3) Again Putin can claim a win, but Donbas remains part of Ukraine with independent Peacekeepers to ensure safety.  
(4) EEA supports Ukraines rebuilding, redevelopment and future prosperity without risking EU integrity (remember their is still systemic corruption in Ukraine).  
(5) The immediate pain on the Russian people is lifted. The threat of Russia shutting off much needed gas in Europe is reduced.  
(6) To stop this or something similar happening again the pain has to be severe. However without a pathway back to some kind of global economic player Russia will fester and become more dangerous. Hopefully in this time the Russian people and/or more moderate General/Oligarchs would overthrow Putin.

>Hundreds of African, Caribbean and South American people desperately trying to flee Ukraine are reportedly being subjected to hostility and racism from border guards and are being ""segregated"" from Ukraine nationals. Distressing footage on social media over the weekend apparently showed guards racially segregating and blocking non-Ukraine nationals from travelling on rescue buses, trains and other modes of transport as they try to cross the border into nearby Poland.  
  
Many migrants of colour have instead reported been pushed to the back of queues and threatened with further violence from guards who tell them safety routes out of the country are prioritised for Ukrainian nationals only. The treatment of international students of colour, many of whom are studying medicine, has caused outrage online as footage shows many queuing in freezing cold temperatures for hours and having to sleeping outside for a chance to cross the boarders at dawn the next day.

Putins strategy rings a little weird to me cause nato was falling apart rather quickly before all of this. Most euro nations weren’t paying the agreed upon GDP % and Germany became reliant on Russa for energy.

His calculation is very weird; makes me wonder if there was something else happening under the table.

Also, he essentially proved every neocon like Mitt Romney right after their 20 year narrative that russia is the true adversary of the world; Putin alone just guaranteed a wildly beefed up nato budget and brought nato together to the likes that nato wouldn’t have achieved.

**Spreading fear** (bringing up nukes constantly, claims of WW3 escalation, constantly bringing up convoys, etc; of course not all instances of this are trolls, some are just scared and nervous people.)

**Misdirection** (moving goalposts, whataboutisms, concern trolling (usually along the lines of **X is terrible, but Y...** where X is something any sensible person can agree with, while Y is what they're trying to steer you towards))

**Sowing doubt** (e.g. excessive pessimism, shooting down things like ""That's never going to happen"", fatalism such as projecting that Ukraine's defeat is certain in the end, etc.)

**Sowing division** (e.g. all the vitriol directed at Germany whenever they lag behind even a little, such as unduly focusing on them only sending non-weaponry at first and all of the demonization of Switzerland for being neutral ... these are valid things to be upset over, but my signal-boosting them they foster toxicity and hope for us to turn us against each other; the sensible approach is to instead recommend people in said countries to contact their representatives and voice their concerns in a civil manner. Another example is things like inflaming divides, e.g. left VS right (Trump, Fox, radical leftists, etc), poor VS rich, white VS PoC (e.g. all the pushing of ""Ukraine is full of Nazis"" and ""Ukrainians are beating and ignoring Indians and black people at the train stations"", etc; there are instances of both, but they try to push it as if it's the norm and not rare occurrences)).

**Misinformation** (especially conspiracy theories; just look at /r/conspiracy if you doubt me ... and another case in point: QAnon. Another aspect of this is making claims without providing reliable sources and exaggerating things.)

The common thread is that they try to find a weakness (a fear, an insecurity, a doubt, an actual event, etc) and then they exaggerate it. Like pouring gasoline on a small flame or hitting a crack with a sledge hammer. This kind of propaganda is far more effective than just completely fabricating something (even though this happens as well). Kind of like the saying **""The best lies have a grain of truth.""**

-----

# How to combat it:

**Downvote posts that are suspicious.** 

Check their post-history to see how much of the above they're engaged in. (Other suspicious tells are: claiming to be X while making claims that seem to run counter to that, young accounts, account inactivity until recently, Word_Word_NNNN names (with the Ns being numbers and the underscores being optional or sometimes hyphens).

**Be sceptical.** (But not paranoid.)

Ask for sources when claims are made. And ask yourself whether the post benefits the victims or the aggressors of the conflict.

**Reassure the worried.**

Ask excessively negative people to take a break and relax, etc.

(Even if a nuclear holocaust is a possibility, it's highly unlikely, and worrying about it won't do us any good.)

**De-escalate.**

Ask people that are pointing fingers at non-Russians in a negative way to focus on the bigger fish instead (more productive; the world needs unity in times like these; the appropriate discussions for other topics are better reserved for a different forum or a different time, IMO. In moderation it's not a problem, but when a thread gets flooded with such a topic it's definitely suspicious.)

When encountering attempts at misdirections, tell them that here and now isn't the time and place for it.

**Downvote toxic trolls, meme spam, etc.**

**Upvote constructive, positive posts.**

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646118597.0,t3_t40q7b,t1_hyvv6du,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

So, let's say, hypothetically, you have two people at three separate stations. Those people don't know any of the other stations. If all three stations activate at the same time, the nuke is fired.

So, one day, you go to station A, and tell them to launch a nuke. Why, they say? So you fire them, and get people who don't ask questions. Their job is to press the button after confirming the order. So they do that, the nuke isn't launched because it's training, etc. 

Station B and C have random drills as well. Never all at the same time. It's just another day, and another fake nuke launched.

One day, the president actually wants to launch a nuke. The order is given to all three stations. What are the chances one of them senses something is afoot? Basically zero. They do this all the time. It's no big deal, except, this time the missile launches and they can't exactly put that cat back in the bag. 

Is this how they do it? No idea. I guessed it after brief thought. But if you give a superpower 80 years to figure out a foolproof method of firing nukes, they will come up with something that guarantees the order.

Now, does that extend to the military? Someone has to tell the stations to fire. That's where the interference could happen.",False,1646119417.0,t3_t40q7b,t1_hyvwc1r,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Now, it depends on how it’s moving. It will undoubtedly sit in idle a lot, and MPG varies on different terrain (asphalt versus off road), so an exact prediction is tough.

It's approximately 150 km by road from Chernobyl to Kyiv, which is the route I assume they're taking since it's the shortest distance to Kyiv from the Border in that direction.  

Apparently a T72 consumes fuel at 10 litres per hour )according to my Google search) when idling at its lowest setting and 30 litres per hour at a tactical idle,  I'd assume they aren't going to turn off their engines ever while in hostile territory.  That means they can run for a max of 120 hours before refueling even if they don't go anywhere.

A $50 bond can be bought for $23. In a few years it matures to $50. If you hold them longer, they gain more value. (War bonds historically mature to the agreed upon purchase price, so it'll stay at $50).

A war bond is issued by a government to fund their military and to stop inflation. They go, ""Hey guys, we need money. Would you like to prepurchase our debt?"" And people do.

The problem is geopolitical precedent. Ukraine isn't a member of NATO or the EU so there isn't a justifiable reason to jump into the middle of an active conflict directly. The reason Russia is so badly in the wrong is they are escalating an armed conflict with very flimsy reasoning.

Where is the line required to get involved? Russia has done it's best to avoid conflict directly with forces outside of Ukraine. If a UK fighter is attacked in Ukraine while representing the UK, then Russia is at war with UK... Then the EU, then NATO... 

As soon as other countries have active fighters in the region, they are at war. Then it escalates and we have to invade Russia too in order to prevent missile launches etc...

The world is trying to avoid all out war by at least containing the hostilities to Ukraine. But like President Zelenskyy said, they are effectively fighting for all of Europe themselves. 

>Let's say he bombs Polish airports. What then?

Oh that's easy. Then Russia has started a war with NATO and the EU and all bets are off.

We are playing nuclear chicken in this case. You can deride the world for being cowardly, but Putin is unhinged enough that him that sending his nukes become a real concern.

At the same time, we are already engaged in a shadow war with Putin with:

* Apocalyptic sanctions almost everywhere, some of which even China and India have to comply
* Cyberattacks from across the globe
* Materiel, armament, and intel from across the globe
* Small volunteer armies from across the globe
* Closure of airspace and military access across NA and EU

No. Just, no. Ukraine isn't a NATO country, and NATO is primarily a defensive, not offensive structure. 

> If the people who hold launch authority are convinced they have an off-ramp better than nuclear Armageddon, they will take it.

Says you. And *maybe* that's true but we can't bank on it. Consider this, most of these Russian soldiers probably don't want to be in Ukraine, and yet the vast majority of them are following orders. People tend to do what they are told. And quite likely, the folks in Russia's silos are in there precisely because the Russian government knows they will do as instructed.

Yea, that sucks. Still better than nuclear war.

Sure. but there's a vast, vast gulf between the threat of the war and an actual war.

If he uses a ground based, silo or mobile launched ballistic missile, there is a decent chance it could be intercepted. It would likely be detected shortly after launch and if missile defense system are jn the area, they could target it and attempt to take the missile out of the sky. 

If they were to load nuclear bombs onto planes, we k ow which of their planes can carry a nuclear bomb and are very likely watching each of those planes closely. If they take off, we look at the altitude and direction they are flying to determine they are likely being deployed to a predetermined target. After what our intel knew about the invasion, I presume we know all of their targets. We could attempt to intercept the bombers before they can deploy the nuclear device. 

A submarine launch nuclear weapon is the hardest to detect or intercept and it will greatldepend in the type of missile that is launched. 

They also have other options that are much less likely to be used. They have hypersonic missiles that are theoretically capable of carrying nuclear warheads but I dont know if they ever developed the nuclear warheads for the missiles and certainly havent tested any warheads in a long time.

I am gonna resist the mean tooth and just answer..

Nuclear winter is a severe and prolonged global climatic cooling effect that is hypothesized to occur after widespread firestorms following a large-scale nuclear war. The hypothesis is based on the fact that such fires can inject soot into the stratosphere, where it can block some direct sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth. It is speculated that the resulting cooling would lead to widespread crop failure and famine. 

Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earths average surface temperature over the past *century* primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people burning fossil fuels.

The issue, as I see it, is these are people who didn't receive any assistance from their nations, so they had to go it alone to the border where there are 100's of thousands of Ukrainians trying to cross. These are nationals without an EU Visa and likely require more thorough review to cross, since their nations didn't make arrangements for them to cross. Example, there was a story circulating about Indian students. India didn't make arrangements, story hit, so India then made arrangements to bus their citizens and make crossing easier. Indian students then began crossing in an easier fashion. Same happened with African students, their embassies saw the news and began arranging to facilitate their crossing.

We've all seen stories of Ukranians waiting in the cold, stranded on roads, and standing in long lines to cross. I saw an interview with an American, his Ukranians wife and 2 year old struggling to get to the border and then to cross. Logistically it's difficult due to the situation.

Essentially the strategy was to to use the armies to threaten Ukraine with harm, nukes to prevent NATO interference, then declare two independent republics. They would do multiple false flags, Russia would rush to protect the new republics, ""counter attacking"" the Ukrainians and seizing a land bridge to Crimea in the name of one of the false republics.

Russia would suffer similar sanctions to 2014, but due to Europe's dependence on their oil they would weather it fine, with all of Putin and the other Oligarch's money safely in foreign currency.

These republics would then later ""vote"" to join the Russian Federation and Putin would declare it the rebirth of the legacy of the USSR.

The problem was that he woefully miscalculated the current political climate in NATO, how much intelligence NATO had on his plans, and how much of a absolute *genius* Zelenskyy turned out to be at information dissemination. Plus I think he might have honestly thought Biden was a doddering old fool rather than an apparently highly skilled diplomat. 

This confluence of events, and fear over appeasement born out of WW2, informed thr EU an NATO, and they decided to call Putin's bluff. The problem then is that Putin, being a strongman who has long used threats of violence to get what he wants, only knows one way to handle his bluff being called: follow through. 

If someone does not believe you will hurt them when you threaten to hurt them, and then you don't hurt them, you lose all leverage from threats of violence. So Putin acted like the corrupt crime boss he is, and attacked. Unfortunately for him, I do not think he intended to actually attack the entirity of the Ukraine, and so the plan wax slapdash and the troops were completely unprepared for it. (This may be why they all seemed so surprised to be ordered to attack.)

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that this was anything but an unforced error on the part of Putin. NATO might have used the error to unify and strengthen the member states agreements with each other, but the only person who could have ordered Russia to attack Ukraine is Putin himself. He miscalculated, and he miscalculated badly.

From a purely strategic standpoint, he created a massive vulnerability in his operation, and undid all the work he had done over decades to disunify NATO and the EU. From a moral standpoint, though, he let his hubris and pride drive him to commit mass murder against civilians to save face. He is purely at fault, and everything that had happened here is a direct result of actions he took.

This is how totalitarian regimes usually end. The longer someone has absolute power, the more out of touch with reality they get. They start making errors like this all the time.",False,1646118872.0,t3_t40q7b,t1_hyvqizb,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Do we?  I understand the reasoning, but this war is costing Putin 20b a day.  I've seen enough *confirmed* lost equipment to easily add up to a billion so far in military hardware, ignoring the cost of missiles, fuel, food, etc.

He has a massive army, but it's *never* been mobilized at quite this scale before.  The Ruso-Georgia war had [less than half the number of troops comitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War).

That's why everyone is saying ""Putin wanted to get this over with quickly"".  Presumably fighting an insurgency won't be *as* expensive daily, and if he could get civilian infrastructure up and running there will be ""minimal costs"" to holding the region with an insurgency.  At least compared to a full scale invasion.

But it seems obvious this *conventional* war phase will continue on for god knows how long.  So at what point does Russia, with its economy currently near circling the drain, simply run out of money to pay their soldiers?  Run out of money for food?

If you commit to mass bombing campaigns of the cities, it's not like you're going to be able to loot already bombed out stores.  Time is of the essence for him.

Every day Ukraine keeps up a conventional fight is another day Putin is spending extreme amounts of money.  The US and allies could sustain that.

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646121906.0,t3_t40q7b,t1_hyvzx6n,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

Additionally, munitions generally create the following types of damage. Blast, fragmentation, incendiary, and cratering.  

Blast is what happens when an explosion occurs and is a result of pressure. A thermobaric weapon is a special type of blast. 

Fragmentation often accompanies a blast since the shells of munitions break apart. Think an artillery round. An artillery round though, typically, kills by blast. Fragmentation round do exist for artillery and missiles. Typically called flechette. It replaces some of the explosive space in the round with darts or metal shavings. Think like a claymore. Very effective against soft materials and troops. 

Incendiary are things that burn. White phosphorous for example. Which is totally legal to use in order to destroy materials of war and equipment. 

Cratering munitions are generally blast munitions that are hardened and fuzed to function after impact. Bunker busters and the like.

I'm not saying that the system is 100% automated, I'm saying that there is no functional way to stop a launch order once it has been issued unless the very tippy top generals who are contact with the president all unanimously say no and either talk them down, or enact a coup if he persists by attempting to notify other commanders of their insubordination. If half the generals disagree, but half agree, the launch happens because the one half can't stop the other from transmitting the launch order. Once the central military authorities have electronically confirmed the order, the buzzers ring in the silos and submarines and the missile commanders who are trained to do literally nothing in that moment other than follow procedure and will have zero communication with any additional entities will do their job as drilled.

Like this for example was the report about Turkey from 2018 before the EU suspended payments do to concernes about human rights and the impression that there was no real will of the politcal leadership to reach EU standards that would allow for joining.

> As a key foreign policy partner and candidate for EU membership, Turkey is the top beneficiary of EU aid outside the EU. We audited the effectiveness of **3.8 billion euro in pre-accession assistance** in the areas of the rule of law, governance and human resources. We found that the assistance is generally well-designed and projects deliver outputs. However, mainly due to a lack of political will and because the Commission has made little use of conditions, EU assistance has insufficiently addressed some fundamental needs and the sustainability of results is often at risk. We therefore consider the effectiveness of the funding to be only limited and make a number of recommendations for improvements, including better targeting of funds and increased conditionality.

That was the situation a week ago right before Russia invaded. Ukraine has been beefed up with modern weapons since 2014. If you've spent any time on this subreddit in the past week that should be obvious. Javelin Missiles, Turkish combat drones, manpads... that didn't deter Russia at all, though it did lead to their current slog.

>Because Putin couldn't afford to rebuild his army

Your points #5 and #6 negate this. 

>What has he ACTUALLY gained? An autonomous region with UN Peacekeepers, Lost Crimea, Destroyed his economy and international standing. What I've suggested is a WORSE territorial position than has existed for the last 8 years.

You hadn't mentioned Crimea before, there is no way he'd give Crimea back but get to keep Donbass, that's silly. Crimea will stay no matter how bad Russia gets its ass kicked. There's no ""semi-autonomous status"" for eastern Ukranian regions, that is literally the same thing as Russian control, because the pro-russian insurgents there don't want independence, they want Russia. UN Peacekeepers won't matter because Russia will effectively have those regions. They either go to Ukraine or Russia, it's silly to pretend that some in-between situation exists or would be sustainable.

Their economy is not destroyed if the sanctions get lifted soon, which is what you propose. 

And as for international standing, the very premise of your proposal is that they should be granted higher international standing than they currently are experiencing as a consequence of their actions. 

Your whole plan here it to semi-rehabilitate Russia while forcing Ukraine to accept less international standing by not being allowed to join alliances of its choosing.

The solution for Russia is simple, they end their attacks, withdraw their forces, agree to not violate Ukraine's sovereignty again, and the sanctions go away. Very simple and just.",False,1646122770.0,t3_t40q7b,t1_hyvzbob,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

That much radiation in the atmosphere means:

* no more farming/fresh food in most cities (since they would be the targets)
* no more fresh water, since the fresh water supplies/aquifers feeding into the water supply would be radioactive. 
* no more ability to fish/hunt (radioactive fallout would make going outside unsafe AND ingesting radiation is even worse than it being on your skin)
* Nuclear winter across the globe (which would ensure no more food pretty much across the globe)
* lack of communication and widespread damage to the power grids.

>Read a risk assessment document sometime. We need to be aware of the fact that world leaders do not believe nuclear war would be nearly as catastrophic as the general public thinks it would be. 

I have. For risk assessments, you can't just have scientists/military leaders throw up their hands and say, ""whelp, we're screwed,"" even if there's a 1% chance of survival. They will focus on what can be controlled and offered to politicians/the executive branch to prevent the absolute worst case scenarios. They account for every single variable related to the specific risk that they can think of and come up with suggested long term solutions for it. These solutions tend to only work if implemented PRIOR to the event. 

They also tend to be limited in scope. For example, most risk assessments on nuclear war do not then go into detail about what a ""total war"" between nuclear powers would mean for society. This would include the use of thermobaric weapons, chemical warfare, cyberattacks, EMPs, etc. 

Also, there needs to be enough people who survive (and a small enough amount of radiation in the environment) to allow for babies to be born to repopulate the earth. Research chemical warfare like agent orange on birth rates/mutations in Vietnam. Research the issues of Chernobyl survivors and the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

Sure, there may be some tribes in the Amazon or scientists in Antarctica who may survive, but society would completely collapse and the world as we know it would cease to exist. This is what is meant by a ""world-ending event.""",False,1646122456.0,t3_t40q7b,t1_hyvxwcr,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

In Kiev and other surrounded cities, I'm inclined to agree. But that's not the whole country, only small pieces of it. If the Ukrainians are willing to surrender after key cities fall, it could end there, but Russia doesn't currently have the manpower and resources to actually occupy the country, that would require moving the economy to a full war footing and they have made no preparations for that, and the western part of the country, where the resources are coming from, remains uncontested.
