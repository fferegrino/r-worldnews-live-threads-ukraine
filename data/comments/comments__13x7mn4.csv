They're told they will be raped, dismembered, shot, mutilated and tortured, this man agreed to be filmed to put the record straight. He's literally in tears describing how astounded he was with the way he was actually treated, fairly, humanely and within the rules of war.

There are no losers when an enemy soldier surrenders, Ukrainians do not have to risk their own lives fighting them and another PoW gets to eventually go home and spread the word of his treatment.

Surrendering should be encouraged and applauded 👏🏼

>
>First, the advertiser. It's a nothing Facebook page targeting people based in Israel who've interacted with content like graphic novels and consumer electronics.
>
>The page is running another ad too. Both use the same text:
>
>""Israel should focus all attention on fighting the economic crisis. Supporting the conflicts of others is an unjustified luxury. Every shekel counts""
>
>Now the link. This is where it gets interesting. The URL, cartflower[.]net redirects me to a story on Israeli magazine The Liberal titled ""Ukraine is Expensive"" and claims Israel's meagre aid to Ukraine is creating a domestic financial crisis. 
>
>Or does it?
>
>Looking closer. The URL is theliberal[.]net, but the real publication is http://theliberal.co.il. The propagandists bought theliberal[.]net, created a single page cloning the real Liberal, and uploaded a fake article in the name of @vibeisrael CEO Joanna Landau.
>
>So this took a bit of work. They had to buy the fake domain and the cartflower redirect domain, write the fake article in Hebrew, clone the Liberal, set up the Facebook page, commission the original cartoons and buy ads. All to target a tiny amount of humanitarian aid to Ukraine
>
>Given how broken Facebook's ad approval process seems to be (guns, drugs and scams get approved easily now), I wonder how much of this is going on in other language markets.

I am always glad to talk with a true friend of Ukraine, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom @RishiSunak, for these are always very meaningful meetings with a powerful result for our common security!

Today, I noted the recent transfer of Storm Shadow long-range missiles to 🇺🇦. These are exactly the weapons we need today. They help us win.

I informed him about the situation on the frontline. To protect our population and civilian infrastructure, it is necessary to create an ""air shield"" over 🇺🇦 cities. We discussed the issue of Ukraine's expectations from the #NATOSummit in Vilnius. It is important for 🇺🇦 to receive a clear signal about the prospects of membership in the Alliance, which will be another motivating factor for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the entire 🇺🇦 people.

I thank the 🇬🇧 and Mr. Prime Minister personally for the assistance provided to Ukraine. For the leadership in creating a tank and aviation coalition, in particular in readiness to start training 🇺🇦 pilots.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 1 June 2023.  


* On 27 May 2023, Russian opposition politician Boris Nadezhdin appeared on Russia’s NTV channel and called for a new president to be elected in 2024, in order to rebuild normal relations with Europe.  

* Nadezhdin has been a vocal critic of the war since the invasion, but this is highly likely the first call for Putin to be replaced on Russian state-approved TV since it began.  

* In the last 15 months, Russia has introduced limitations on freedom of speech which haven’t been seen since Soviet times.  

* However, there is a realistic possibility that recent vitriolic rhetoric by nationalist figures such as Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin is emboldening opposition figures to challenge taboo topics.

The message, a text note for now, was posted on the large GREY ZONE Telegram channel, which became known since the start of the full-scale invasion for posts criticising negative elements of the Russian army, but the channel admin's identity remained anonymous.

A photo is attached to the post, apparently showing Utkin exiting a helicopter at an unknown landing area, signed with ""GREY ZONE"" ""Wagner"".

The note itself lists responses to a number of claims and accusations made by the Chechens loyal to Putin. Utkin reminded his counterparts of knowing each other since the times of the 1st and 2nd Chechen wars and his readiness to “talk”. The mention of two wars in this case is hardly too accidental since during the first war the men were on opposite sides of the front.

But the appearance of Utkin on stage is likely to continue as it serves the purpose of supporting Prigozhin and carving out more influence in the internal conflict between rapidly emerging factions within the Russian public space.

Here's my armchair general prediction on part of the counter offensive. Obviously, Ukraine would like to cut the land bridge. The Vuhledar-Mariupol axis is the shortest distance between frontline and Azov sea (80km). Other axes are closer to 100km. So if you are trying to get to the Azov sea with least casualties, the shortest path probably offers you something there. 

This axis is only 20 km from the 2014 frontline. This frontline is among the best fortified area of the entire battlefield because Ukraine and Russia have had 8 years to create these defensive positions. If Ukraine can drive down to the sea and retake their old defensive positions, it will be significantly easier to hold that eastern flank for several months. 

When looking at the geography, there are several rivers and reservoirs running almost perfectly North-South, exactly from Vuhledar all the way down to Mariupol. This is extremely advantageous for Ukraine because it is much harder to defend territory when you are flanked by a river. When defending, it does not allow you to move on that side or reinforce it. You are basically partially encircled all of the time. Also, part of the axis has several parallel rivers, forming a sort of corridor that would be extremely hard to defend. These corridors leave only one way for Russia to supply itself and retreat. I feel like the fear would set in when the soldiers realize that they have nowhere to go. Ukraine has been given a lot of bridge layers and engineering equipment which you would need if you are going to cross several smaller rivers and canals.

There is also a highway and a rail line running along that axis directly into Mariupol. So that whole area of operation will be easy to supply because of that road, because you don’t need to supply over muddy roads as much. 

There is also the fact that Ukraine keeps hitting Mariupol with Storm Shadow. Although that could just be because Russia concentrated a lot of supplies and commanders there and not because of any particular intent by Ukraine.

While yes, I dont doubt there are some elements that are truly neo nazis (which exist in pretty much every country to a lesser or greater degree), like Azov, which I dont buy them being de-ideologized.

Some if not most of the accusations seem to stem for Ukraine's admiration for Stephan Bandera and Ukraine's attitude in early Barbarossa. While Bandera collaborated with nazis there is some important context to add.

Ukraine had just gone through Holodomor by Stalin, which had deaths in the millions. The feeling for Ukraine's independence was naturally high and Bandera was the leader of the independence movement. So in come the nazis and they are received as liberators and Bandera cooperates with them. But here is the thing though, Ukranians back then didnt have the hindsight of history, they didnt knew the nazis were, well, the nazis. They just expected they were like the WW1 Germans and Hitler to be Napoleon 2. Once the Nazis showed their true colors, and arrested Bandera because they had no intentions for an independent Ukraine, they threw their weight behind the USSR. Also it is debatable Ukraine would had been the only ones, had the nazis not being nazis and been more rational there are arguments that virtually all the USSR would have welcomed them as liberators and handed Stalin to them in a silver plate.

Yes, Ukraine cooperated with the nazis, early on when they were an unknown element and their current dictator had just caused a famine that killed from 3.5 to 5 million to them. Who wouldnt? And Bandera happened to be a collaborator in that context, who is liked in Ukraine simply because he was a strong independence figure.

I have no idea where, I only have a vague notion of when. But something is going to break, and it’s not going to be Ukraine, it’s armed forces or its people. Somewhere, at some not too distant point in time the second strongest army in Ukraine is going to be tested and tested again, somewhere it will fail. It may not be obvious at first and could even start with some set-backs during the initial counter-offensive. But like a condemned building with cracks in its foundation, its stability(capability) will deteriorate due to poor construction/maintenance, time and outside forces. Eventually it crumbles perhaps not to the ground but it will break nonetheless.

Spring Storms are already casting long Shadows deep behind the front lines. This summer German built tanks will once again be rumbling across the western steppes of Eurasia. But this time they will be accompanied by American made Bradleys filled with well trained and equipped Ukrainian troops, who know exactly what and who they are fighting for. Some mobik units will simply be overwhelmed, break and run either to the rear or perhaps more prudently run towards surrender.

It won’t be quick or easy, it will produce a great loss of lives on both sides.

*Separately, he said that Washington has received assurances that F-16 fighters will not be used for attacks on the Russian Federation in the future: ""And we have gotten these assurances at various levels: not just from President Zelenskyy, but also from other senior military and defence leaders in Ukraine.""*

We all understand why - perhaps attacks on Russian soil would provoke them to destroy the world, themselves included?  

This argument has clearly run its course, at least for European allies watching the debt ceiling and next presidential race. It's time to think about the future - Ukraine is a NATO partner, and in defending their right to join the free world, are also defending us. It's great that Patriot and other systems are so effective, but there is no better defence than the old reality of war - if you attack someone else, they will attack you. The war would already be over if ordinary Russians had to live the same reality Ukrainians do.

Where western defense contractors are making bank right now is off of western alliance countries either purchasing their wares for Ukraine, orders to replace the equipment donated by western alliance countries with new/upgraded equipment, or western allied countries realizing that with a belligerent Russia, they need to increase their stockpiles of munitions and ammo.

All that said, it will be a market, even if I'm a bit skeptical about how huge a market it will be.

First, it's nearly impossible to win a war only through defense unless you are willing to hide in the mountains/jungles and conduct a decades long guerilla war and hope for political will of the invaders to wane enough for them to quit.  Second, this forces Russia to divert resources to border security.  Ukraine is already defending its own borders, so this helps resolve a strategic asymmetry.  Third, Belgorod is a legitimate military target, as it is a major logistics hub for the invasion with tons of ammo/weapons storage in the region, as well as having a large troop presence, and being a maintenance hub for damaged equipment.
  
Fourth - this is a Russian militia acting independently of UAF command.  That's why the ""raids"" are ""ongoing"" because it is partisan warfare largely organized by locals.

There's a fairly good chance that what you're seeing here is simply water penetrating concrete (which is often naturally porous) and then creating a surface layer of corrosion on the reinforcement (rebar) inside. Even if it's a corrosion resistant material, galvanised, or anything like that, surface corrosion generally takes up more space than the material that is being corroded. 

That equals a small amount of lateral expansion and the result is cracks in the concrete. It can be a really serious issue leading to hastening of the corrosion, structural compromise of the concrete, chunks cracking or flaking out, and ultimately total failure of the structure, or it can be totally harmless if monitored and managed. *Many* older reinforced concrete structures suffer from this problem and most don't have any significant reduction in their structural integrity.",False,1685627898.0,t3_13x7mn4,t1_jmh2a9l,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Additionally when steel corrodes, the steel rust expands to occupy a greater volume than the steel itself, which creates expansion stress in the concrete and can eventually cause further cracking, delamination and spalling generally.

Ukraine made themselves open to Russian influence in a way Poland didn't.  They didn't have a national identity the way the Poles did, and have really only begun creating one post-2014.  It invited corruption, and while they have made strides at repairing that recently (Ironically, the war actually helped those efforts), it still exists in abundance, and we don't know if it will come back, what degree it will come back post-war, or how even at its current levels, efforts to repair the country will be delayed or stymied.  

Ukraine has some natural resources and outstanding farmland, yes, but large economies aren't built purely from natural resources.  It's built from industry, turning those raw resources into goods, which adds value.  A lot of Ukrainian industry has been destroyed in this war, and Ukraine wasn't exactly an industrial powerhouse before the war.

Ukraine also faces a demographic nightmare, and did even before the war.  There's only so big an economy you can have without young consumers to buy stuff, young workers to make stuff, and Ukraine has a shortage of young people.  A shrinking population means a shrinking economy.  Add to that the young people who have died in this war, and the millions of refugees, many of which will decide to stay in the countries they fled to after the war, especially if given EU citizenship via Ukraine joining the EU.  This is a problem you can't fix with a simple government policy or two, and is going to be a generational problem.

I could go on.  I have other examples, but I think I've made my point.  I realize that I'm being awfully pessimistic here and only talking about the challenges that Ukraine has and not the good things Ukraine has going for it.  I do believe Ukraine is a fixer-upper country and has potential, but it's not a matter of a new coat of paint and maybe replacing a window.  It's a massive project, and many of its systems, institutions, and industries will need to be rebuilt from the ground up.  It will be a multi-decades process, even if everything goes right and nobody screws anything up.

2. Elon Musk is a conman and a liar. From this side, it looks like **YOU** are getting confused to my argument. I compare Elon Musk to P. T Barnum as far as US American History figures go.

P.T. Barnum is the kind of guy to lie about what his money would do (ex: fund a museum full of lies). When that didn't work, he used the money to create a circus. Etc. etc. He was very ""flexible"" with his ethics, but most noticeably, he constantly lied about what his money would do and what he planned to accomplish.

The rocket can launch with multiple engine outs. It's an advantage of rockets with multiple engines. Then another 3 failed minutes into flight and it was over, yeah.

The issue is, the only way to properly test the 33 engines is by flying the prototype.

I'm sure they'd prefer a full duration static fire first, but no launch pad and no test stand can handle such power. Even with proper flame diverter, as the rocket burns propellant, the hold down clamps would not be able to keep the rocket attached to the pad.
