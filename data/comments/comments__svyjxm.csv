* Regarding Threat of Committing Terrorist Attacks at Industry Facilities of the So-Called DPR and LPR 

* According to the DIU, the Kremlin leaders continue to persistently seek for reasons to accuse our state of illegal actions in Donbas in order to justify the escalation of the armed aggression. 

* Given the fact that all previous attempts to accuse Ukraine of violating agreements failed, the RF leadership is considering the possibility of organizing a terrorist attack in the so-called DPR and LPR, which would create a pretext for an attack, the so-called ""casus belli"" 

* Photos show the objects that most likely would be targeted during terrorist attacks, depending on the scale and threat of negative consequences. The information at the DIU is provided in Ukrainian, and information about the ""pseudo-republics"" is provided in Russian.

Sure, they can take any part of Ukraine they want. But they can't hold it.

Putin can get a week, maybe of two, of feel-good ""Russian Military Great"" headlines, assuming his soldiers can avoid blowing hospitals and day care centers, and they can keep the Ukrainian defenses from taking out too many planes or tanks. 

But if Putin's goal was to keep NATO away from his borders, he's miscalculated badly. NATO has never been more unified, they're increasing their military budgets, and Sweden and Finland are thinking of applying for NATO membership. When Russia withdraws from Ukraine, as they inevitably must, the very FIRST think Ukraine will do is apply for NATO membership and protection.

Plus this action will pretty much guarantee that Europe will rethink how much natural gas they buy from Russia. The US and other countries will be happy to make up the shortfall, and Russia will have to sell their natural gas to China at cut-rate prices.

It seems everyone is assuming that Russia will waltz in and take Kiev in a few days but I'm not so sure. But I'm far from an expert and would be interested in hearing from those who are.

Here's my thinking

- Russia's army is far larger than Ukraine's but you can't attack with your entire army. It sounds like Russia is planning to attack with something between 150k and 200k troops. Ukraine's army is 125k plus 200k paramilitaries - even if you discount the paramilitaries that's not anything like the 3:1 troop advantage successful invasions normally need
- Russia's armies do seem far more competent and capable than Ukraines, hence them kicking their arse in Donbass for the past 8 years, and we've seen them make short work of Georgia and Chechnya the second time around. But given Russia is basically broke, and has been for some time, and given it's a country that in economic terms is smaller than Spain, it really wouldn't surprise me if their military was somewhat hollow - highly capable tip of spear units but then the rest are just not up to scratch.
- it's not like it will be a surprise attack is it? Ukraine has presumably been able to prepare their defence in detail and will have the precise coordinates from US intel of the staging grounds they will be launching the attack from. So Russia will need to attack into prepared defences with no benefit of surprise whatsoever and an enemy that is waiting for them
- that said Russia has massive advantage in terms of aircraft and artillery, so maybe they can just shock and awe carpet bomb the Ukrainian army into smithereens before they even cross the border? Except presumably knows this and will have a plan for it in terms of putting significant amounts of its armed forces into deep hiding/hardened bunkers ready to launch a counteroffensive? And aircraft and artillery are really expensive, and Russia will lose some. Can they afford that? 

As I say I'm not an expert and I'd be interested to hear from those that are, but my sense is if Russia invades Ukraine it will find it really difficult to make progress, will suffer massive casualties which come at a huge political cost and will be forced to spend billions that it doesn't really have ... and that's before you even get into the costs of sanctions and maintaining occupation. I'm definitely not saying Putin won't do it, but I do think if he does it will be a huge strategic blunder.

Also if any mil/intel types do come across this, another question for you: what's going on right now in Syria/Chetchnya/Dagestan etc... I know all those rebel movements have been mostly crushed, but not entirely, and surely if you were a rebel you would think that now is the perfect time to launch a major offensive given how thinly stretched Russia is.",False,1645267883.0,t3_svyjxm,t3_svyjxm,,0,26,0,26,1,0,

At the morgue they said, ""Want to see what we'll dress him in?"" I do! They dressed him up in formal wear, with his service cap. They couldn't get shoes on him because his feet had swelled up. They had to cut up the formal wear, too, because they couldn't get it on him, there wasn't a whole body to put it on. It was all -- wounds.

The only way we’re leaking this info (without heads rolling at the Kremlin) is if we have the Kremlin utterly infiltrated.   This stuff is probably coming from mulitple sources and we can release it because there’s no one person to blame.   Other option is that our sources are so high-level they aren’t suspect.  We have to have multiple very high-level US assets in high level roles at the KGB.   Psychologically, I can’t imagine the toll on the Putin and the Kremlin.  

And no, the same isn’t true in reverse.  The Kremlin gets caught trying to steal our info so often because they don’t have as much first hand access. 

They really thought they had a plan to fool everyone.  I remember the original intel said they created a false flag with fake and graphic videos of  injured civilians etc that had Hollywood level production value.

I mean in many ways it is right now, but I see this becoming worse over time. Russia’s economy is incredibly dependent on oil, but their oil sucks. By now they’re probably stuck with 30% high bitumen oil (full of hard to remove garbage) and and even higher percentage of [tight oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_oil) which is also garbage like shale.

This stuff already takes a ton of energy to extract and refine (20%+ of the energy contained in the oil itself), requiring oil prices of $75 or so to turn a profit. This will become 40%+ within a decade. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia can extract high quality oil for $10-15 a barrel.

Russia needs to keep the world unstable to fix high oil prices, and also to keep it from presenting a united front against them. As time goes on and Russia becomes impoverished, they will eventually begin to raid nearby breadbaskets like the Ukraine.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they eventually just demand money in a mafia style shakedown. What could we do to stop them? They can press a button to end the world.

Museum visitors in front of the Martin Niemöller quotation
Visitors stand in front of the quotation from Martin Niemöller that is on display in the Permanent Exhibition of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Niemöller was a Lutheran minister and early Nazi supporter who was later imprisoned for opposing Hitler's regime.

US Holocaust Memorial Museum
The quotation stems from Niemöller's lectures during the early postwar period. Different versions of the quotation exist. These can be attributed to the fact that Niemöller spoke extemporaneously and in a number of settings. Much controversy surrounds the content of the poem as it has been printed in varying forms, referring to diverse groups such as Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Trade Unionists, or Communists depending upon the version. Nonetheless his point was that Germans had been complicit through their silence in the Nazi imprisonment, persecution, and murder of millions of people. He felt this was true in particular of the leaders of the Protestant churches (of which the Lutheran church was one denomination).

A Controversial Figure
In the wake of Nazism, Niemöller's prominence as an opposition figure gave him international stature though he remained controversial. Not until 1963, in a West German television interview, did Niemöller acknowledge and make a statement of regret about his own antisemitism.2 He was nonetheless one of the earliest Germans to talk publicly about broader complicity in the Holocaust and guilt for what had happened to the Jews. In his book Über die deutsche Schuld, Not und Hoffnung (published in English as Of Guilt and Hope)—which appeared in January 1946—Niemöller wrote:

""Thus, whenever I chance to meet a Jew known to me before, then, as a Christian, I cannot but tell him: 'Dear Friend, I stand in front of you, but we can not get together, for there is guilt between us. I have sinned and my people has sinned against thy people and against thyself.'""

The weather may have helped save Moscow in the past, but Russians are aware that modern warfare wouldn't be affected by weather. So what do they have instead? Distance. 
It may be psychological, but the shorter the distance from Russia's border to Moscow, the more they feel threatened. 
Ukraine and it's developing relationship with the west (no doubt the west is very generous to them) leaves Russia feeling vulnerable. Putin needs to act to make his people happy. Despite what the US media portrays, every Russian I have met seems to love him. 
Surely it would have been better for the world for Ukraine to be neutral. Fur Nato and the USA to agree to leave ""space"" between Russia and Europe. Clearly there are other political agendas at work here. The USA wants to project its power right on Russia's doorsteps. Russia doesn't want to lose face, and to be made to look like the USA runs the world. Ukraine is a pawn here. 
I heard that the UK has said that they will treat Ukraine as an ally. That's a concern. They said the same thing for Poland. That was the reason they went to war, yet at the end of the war they did a deal with Stalin and the USA and gave Poland to Stalin. There is a reason why many polish people and many other eastern European nations hate the USA and the UK. And yes, many don't like Russia as well. 
But Ukraine does most of its trade with Russia. Many people consider themselves to either be Russian or have strong connections to Russia. You don't change this overnight. 
None of this is new. This is exactly why Putin had to take Crimea. This was Russia's military access to the ocean. To see it fall into the hands of the west and NATO would have been catastrophic. Think Hawaii being in Chinese hands for a similar situation. You wouldn't be too far wrong to think that the USA is pressuring Russia. 
Diplomacy has not been attempted. All along Russia has said that they will stop if Ukraine Nevers becomes a member of NATO. The USA has said that it will not yield on this point, and that Ukraine can decide. But once again, Ukraine is the pawn. The USA and NATO care as much fur them as the allies did about Poland in WW2. And it's the people who will suffer. This is wrong. 
I'm not defending Putin. I'm just saying that if you look at history and look at what is happening, this is the USA forcing Russia into a no win situation. This isn't Georgia. This is about the USA Projecting power and reminding the world, especially China, that they are in charge. Non Americans will understand this, but sadly most Americans will not. There is a world beyond the US, and peace is still an option here, but it's in the hands of the USA, not Putin.",False,1645257323.0,t3_svyjxm,t3_svyjxm,,0,-35,0,-35,0,0,

He wants Crimea for a giant list of strategic reasons.  He doesn't support a lengthy insurgency campaign or other deniable approaches to getting it.  He just takes it.  Because strong men take what they want.

Taking Crimea turned Ukraine from a country sort of ""meh"" about NATO and the EU into a country *extremely* interested in NATO and the EU.  This was entirely predictable - when you start conquering chunks of a country, they're going to turn to your geopolitical adversaries.

But apparently Putin didn't think this was the guaranteed outcome.  He seemed to think threats and fear would keep Ukraine allied with Russia, or at worse neutral.  Because again, strongmen rule via threats, violence and fear.  It worked in Georgia, it worked domestically, surely it will work with Crimea.

 >The RC-135U Combat Sent is designed to collect technical intelligence on adversary radar emitter systems. Combat Sent data is collected to develop new or upgraded radar warning receivers, radar jammers, decoys, anti-radiation missiles, and training simulators. Distinctly identified by the antenna arrays on the fuselage chin, tailcone, and wing tips, three RC-135C aircraft were converted to RC-135U (63-9792, 64–14847, & 64-14849) in the early 1970s. 63-9792 was later converted into a Rivet Joint in 1978, and all aircraft remain in service based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.

He tells a story about logging into a video chat that he was told was for a live RT interview. Instead, he was greeted by Russian intelligence who pretty much used Jones' narcissism to extract info out of him and make sure he wasn't just doing a character and then told him that everybody in Russia loved InfoWars and that Putin listens everyday. Alex, being dense as a goddam brick and hyper narcissistic, was flipped into being an unwitting Russian propaganda asset  because that flattered the fuck out of him. This is also about the same time that Steve Pieczenik and Robert Stone (both in the '45 Group', Trump's campaign inner circle) started getting buddy-buddy with Alex on air.

It's certainly possible that with NATO providing intel and arms Ukrainian forces could wage a successful asymmetric defense, drag out the fighting and make it bloody enough to give Putin second thoughts, but doing so might require far more destruction and loss than anyone on the Ukrainian side has the stomach for.

>Russia's army is far larger than Ukraine's but you can't attack with your entire army.

Why? Not like China will suddenly invade the far east if Russia moves the majority of its forces to invade Ukraine. The fact that Russia have deployed ""only"" 130-150 thousand troops means they are either **very** confident that the difference in firepower is massively in their favour or they are simply not ready to invade yet (but are prepared to deploy extra forces in short notice).

>But given Russia is basically broke, and has been for some time

What? Where did you get that info from? In recent years they have been runnin on a surplus, except 2020 due to pandemic reasons. Even if they were ""broke"" the recent boom in the price of oil and gas has done wonders to remedy their economic situation.

>and given it's a country that in economic terms is smaller than Spain

Don't compare the rouble to the euro, Russia's economy is more than twice that of Spain.

Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD?locations=RU-ES

>it really wouldn't surprise me if their military was somewhat hollow - highly capable tip of spear units but then the rest are just not up to scratch.

I don't know, they reformed their army and downsized it to avoid such a problem. Clearly they have elite spear units but the rest should be up to standard. Every western observer I have read is giving a favourable assessment of the Russian armed forces.

>but my sense is if Russia invades Ukraine it will find it really difficult to make progress, will suffer massive casualties which come at a huge political cost and will be forced to spend billions that it doesn't really have

I am not a military analyst either, but the power disparity between these countries and the favourable position of Russian forces makes it obvious that they will win. Ukraine is no Finland. Russian casualties may come to number in the tens of thousands but the Ukrainian armed forces will be annihilated.

The big factor here may be geography. Eastern Ukraine is flatlands, except the Donetsk ridge that Russian separatists already occupy. Russia can attack from the north through Belarus and has annexed Crimea in the south. If they have the logistical capacity to pull off a proper invasion, I expect a thrust in the south to assist a ""breakout"" from Crimea, followed by a two-pronged attack from the Donbass and Belarus (that can easily pretend to be neutral in the first few days) to encircle the Ukrainian army east of the Dniepr. After that Russian forces need only establish bridgeheads on the river and besiege Kiev. Game over.

>and that's before you even get into the costs of sanctions and maintaining occupation. I'm definitely not saying Putin won't do it, but I do think if he does it will be a huge strategic blunder.

With that I agree. The stakes are so high now that the only thing that could justify a full-blown invasion would be the stationing of NATO forces in Ukraine or Ukraine being on the verge of joining the alliance.

On the other hand, there is still a risk of a smaller attack to secure more of the Donbass region that is claimed by the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.

>what's going on right now in Syria/Chetchnya/Dagestan etc... I know all those rebel movements have been mostly crushed, but not entirely,

The Caucasian insurgencies have been completely pacified by Russian security forces since about 2017.

The Syrian rebels have been reduced to a single province and some Turkish-backed groups and stand no chance on their own. A possible NATO counter-strike could be Turkey invading Syria since they already occupy parts of it (which makes them supporting Ukraine kinda hypocritical).

But once the rumors start flying and a crowd gathers round, neither can back down without being seen as the loser.

 >Tight oil (also known as shale oil, shale-hosted oil or light tight oil, abbreviated LTO) is light crude oil contained in petroleum-bearing formations of low permeability, often shale or tight sandstone. Economic production from tight oil formations requires the same hydraulic fracturing and often uses the same horizontal well technology used in the production of shale gas. While sometimes called ""shale oil"", tight oil should not be confused with oil shale (shale rich in kerogen) or shale oil (oil produced from oil shales).

The EU deal with most of their security related issues in accordance with the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Different measures can be enacted through decisions made by a council consisting of the security ministers of each respective member nation. The actions taken in response to territorial crises are limited to peacekeeping efforts and in some, rare, cases supporting active forces in certain regions (this falls under CSDP which is a part of CFSP). The issue is that the decisions on how to act made by the council have to be reached with a large degree of unanimity. This means that countries that have vested interests in not angering Russia (due to fear, friendly relationships or possible economic benefits + the gas pipes) ultimately have a soft veto on what actions are taken. Thus, a lot of the actions and public statements that the EU make about conflicts are vague, mostly non-controversial and sometimes contradicting.

The UN are in a similar situation when it comes to providing any support, as any foreign relation issue is handled by the security council where Russia is one of five countries with a permanent seat and through that has a veto on any decision that could be made.",False,1645260269.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxk1d6a,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

On the remote chance that he does actually want diplomacy to work, this could be a way to keep pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the things that Russia wants. Scholz' visit to Ukraine and Russia essentially floated the idea that Ukraine would give the separatists a limited form of self-government to adhere to Minsk II, and also that they'd consider a referendum on NATO which may lead to Ukraine giving up its aspirations to join NATO. The US has also offered to let Russia inspect certain NATO bases and facilities in Eastern Europe, provided those host countries consent, and is willing to limit ballistic missiles in the area as well. 

All of that sounds good and potentially enough to get Russia to stand down, though they would be huge concessions from Ukraine. But none of this is actually on paper, and so Russia wants more concrete assurances if it's going to be taking away its military leverage. Keeping their army there to see if the West can pressure Ukraine into accepting this is probably another aspect of why those forces are still there.

Doing nothing, or responding too weakly, would be a huge blow to global non-proliferation efforts as it would send the message to every aspiring nuclear power that acquiring and using these weapons in even low intensity conflicts no longer risks major retaliation from the great powers. Of course due to the size of Russia's arsenal that response would have to be calibrated in order to avoid triggering an all out civilization ending exchange but there's a range of conceivable options (caveat: I have below armchair level geopolitical knowledge so take with a boulder of salt)

Single or few low yield warheads on strictly military targets far from civilians? Might not necessitate a military response but sanctions and diplomatic isolation would be ramped up to 11. Expect major pressure on China to join in and under the circumstances they probably would. Russia is quickly becoming the junior partner in their alliance and I don't think China would appreciate the sudden shift toward looser norms on employing nukes given the size of their arsenal relative to the multiple nuclear armed states they find themselves at odds with.

Obliterating a city or a full on nuclear attack on military assets without regard for proximity of civilian population centers? Major military intervention would probably be necessary. US/NATO forces could more than likely establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine although such a campaign might be costly, especially in the eastern part of the country, due to the sheer amount of AA assets Russia has at its disposal.

The original model that predicted nuclear winter was heavily flawed in a number of important ways. The underlying assumption of the theory is that, in a nuclear war, massive amounts of debris-dust, soot, ash, etc-would be deposited into the atmosphere, reducing sunlight levels across the globe (more likely just the northern hemisphere) and triggering a cooling event.

The major problem with this assumption is that the creators of the original model assumed that attacks on cities would result in large firestorms as occurred in Hiroshima where the overwhelming majority of buildings were wooden. Of course, most modern urban areas are primarily constructed from brick, steel, and concrete which would severely inhibit firestorms from forming. It's been a while and I don't recall whether this is 100% accurate or not but I also seem to recall displacement of soil into the atmosphere also factoring into the model which is also a reduced concern as most weapons would be set to detonate as air bursts as this is a much more effective means of devastating a large area.

Also worth considering is that, due to major reductions to active arsenals thanks to post Cold War arms reduction treaties, there are fewer warheads available for counter value (population centers) targeting if nuclear armed states want to maintain credible counter force (military stuff) capabilities. Basically if you live in a large city you're still getting vaporized but if you live somewhere like Topeka or Boise you just might be (un) lucky enough to find out what living in the shattered remnants of a nation used to just in time delivery will look like.

Shooting at insurgents is basically irrelevant experience for a near-pear conflict such as a theoretical US-Russia war. Additionally, units aren't composed of soldiers fresh out of basic. US forces have (for a few more years) combat veterans filling out most of its upper level leadership positions. There are basically no junior enlisted combat veterans in the US Army right now. This does give the US an edge over Russian forces, because Russia does not have the same amount of recent experience as the US does. 

2. Again, experience here is basically irrelevant. No one really knows what a fight between the US and Russia would look like, but it would be bloody. Russian combat doctrine is very different from US doctrine, and the US is not better in all aspects. Russia has better ground based air defenses, artillery, and cyberwarfare, if I recall correctly. The US has better armor and aviation. Russian forces have had a massive modernization program recently, so no one really knows how good they are.

The conflict in 2014 tested the resilience of a NATO neighbour, and there was none beyond weapon supplies and loans. This is them finishing the job. I also expect further appeasement to Putin's War because this world operates on money and he's hedged the bet correctly. He can have Ukraine because look at what Western countries are concerned about in their borders (COVID and rising inflation due to pandemic related logistic delays).

This will be a war that a lot of people will be outraged by but because of domestic issues in each western country, will allow Russia to do this.

When russia changes the results of an election, when Russia takes out an energy grid that causes people to die, when the worlds oil supply gets pinched? What about when the northern sea routes open up in 5-10 years and Russia ""accidentally"" destroys a merchant vessel? The fact is that modern warfare is going to be a spectrum of everything from information warfare and cyber terrorism to the looming threat of nuclear annihilation.

Rational, informed people who are paying attention to the situation are unlikely to believe the propaganda even if it was well crafted and plausible.

The people who will believe it are the ones who already have existing biases, are in media/social media bubbles that only ever confirm those biases and who never bother fact checking anything. They're likely to believe anything that confirms what they already believe regardless of how dumb it is. 

It's like how scam emails are always so dumb and lazy. They are only ever going to work on those who are uninformed, not tech savvy or just outright stupid so there's no point being smart with them.

There's also just the fact that anything you put out, no matter how stupid is something that is going to spread and take more effort to debunk than it took to create. It will take longer for people to see the stuff debunking it if they even see it at all. So by putting out constant nonsense you keep people unsure what is really happening and make it harder to find the truth of the situation. Every new bit of propaganda gets more attention than the content debunking the previous stuff.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had some influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

There is the very real issue of his how reliant many European countries have become on Russian natural gas, and even if Biden rolled back all of his regulations that significantly slowed the exporting of LNg from USA it wouldn’t come fast enough. Also the Saudis seem to be hell bent on not increasing supply even if it comes to a major war that impacts global supply, they’ve all but said even if Russia invades don’t count on them for help stabilizing global energy markets.

I’m not saying this is correct, but it’s just the facts as they are, Germany seemed very upset when President Biden announced that if Russia invaded at all, that Nordstream pipeline was done. Germany’s taken this neutral stance talking about being a mediator even after a conflict should it happen, meanwhile people like Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach were out in the open talking about how we all need to give Putin respect and how it’s very cheap (can’t find the speech on my Phone, but it was some military  conference in India), pretty much implying he can have whatever he wants in Ukraine and if we just let him do it we can still have a good relationship with Russia because it might move Russia further away from China and more towards the west.. Again, not saying I like it, but this is a common sentiment in some major Western European countries leadership, like it’s understandable what Russia is doing, and if we are just nice to him and let him annex a few countries here and there, have his “minor incursions” as President Biden famously gaffed, then Russia will keep giving everyone cheap gas so we can feel good about destroying our domestic energy industry for the environment and also won’t have to invest any money into the military because now Russia is our best friend, just had to let them invade a few countries and displaced millions of innocent civilians,  but they are all poor and stuff.. /s. 

I think Putin has been emboldened by all this and is thinking the time is now on Ukraine before they adopt more sophisticated weapons systems that can make an invasion incredibly costly. I think Russia assumes the sanctions won’t be any worse than what they’ve become used to, China will still be enough of a trading partner to replace a lot of the short term lost productivity with Europe and eventually people will just accept that Russia took an entire country to not rock the status quo of privileged westerns for too long.",False,1645241061.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxj6nki,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost when it was about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraine–Russia border, and wreckage of the aircraft fell near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbas in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

 [The Russian Empire & the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism#The_Russian_Empire_&_the_Soviet_Union) 
 
 >By the 18th century, the Russian Empire extended its control to the Pacific, peacefully forming a common border with the Qing Empire and Empire of Japan. This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The Polish–Russian War of 1792 took place after Polish nobility from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth wrote the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The war resulted in eastern Poland being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918.
 
**[Imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism)** 
 
 >Imperialism is a policy or ideology of extending rule over peoples and other countries, for extending political and economic access, power and control, often through employing hard power, especially military force, but also soft power. While related to the concepts of colonialism and empire, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government.

It’s general purpose is to intercept long wave radio transmissions pinging off the old Eastern Block “черный сталинский пират подземный”.   Rough translation is “Stalin’s black pirate underground”.  It’s invention was circa 1966, with the intended use of relaying top secret transmissions to future USSR moon missions. Although this future was never realized, and it is believed the last real transmission was relayed in the early to mid 70s, extremely high powered CENOS signal receivers can still interpret “echoes” in the system.  As such, many powerful organizations and even some private individuals lease FORTE10, 11, 12 and other (some classified) counterparts to chase the echoes.  Although the computerized flight patterns required to intercept and interpret these signals are not well understood, billions in research and development has been poured into the missions to operate these flights since the rise of the internet in the late 90s.  The general consensus is that the decoded signals contain some of the highest quality, Stalinist era pornography to ever have existed.

Part of that is due to Taiwan being able to host foreign militaries or allow access through their waters. The bigger part however may be the impact it could have on the Chinese people.

The Chinese 'autonomous regions' of Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia make up a huge part of China and they have the same kind of claims to freedom as Taiwan. They all tried to gain independence at some point. For instance Xinjiang trying to become the East Turkistan Republic a couple times only to ultimately be invaded by the CCP and subsumed back into China in the wake of the civil war. Taiwan being independent and functional increases the chances for people in these regions looking at them and wanting the same.

The CCP narrative to the Chinese people is that democracy doesn't work and that the form of government they are under is the only way to succeed. So to have an island just off-shore with a functional democracy, free speech and a healthy economy populated mostly by people racially identical to most of China shows that the narrative is wrong. The CCP like to tell their population that Chinese people are different or even superior to other races. There's a lot of weird stuff in the propaganda about them evolving from a different human subspecies to everyone else and being physiologically different so having different needs, like medicine and food. So the fact that most people in Taiwan look and sound the same as the Chinese yet behave differently and function under a totally different system dispels the racial narratives the CCP pushes.

There's also the economic factors. Taiwan producing over 90% of the world's microchips gives them economic power that China would like for itself. Taking the island and seizing that manufacturing would not only provide a financial boost but give them greater control over world markets and their ability to negotiate on the world stage.",False,1645274065.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxkhff3,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Without her, the system cannot work.

It said that it proposed to observe that convention except when there was an emergency and such action would not be appropriate. In the United Kingdom, the monarch is the Head of the Armed Forces and the decision to deploy the armed forces in situations of armed conflict is currently a prerogative power.

He was pushing for countries to contribute 4% of GDP. The US contributes 3.7% ish, and other countries contribute 1.7% on average.

They agreed upon a target of 2% of GDP by like 2024 or something, he wanted more to match

He didn't want to pull out. He was trying to hardball negotiate (so it had more resources).

He also specifically attacked china for supporting Russia economically, imposed sanctions on Russia, and even had an indirect standoff with Putin in Syria. A lot of this ""trump would let Russia do anything"" is kind of nonsense.

Edit to add: frankly, he was right. NATO is more for the protection of our allies than us. Most of the military power comes from us, in the form of missile defense systems, us having probably over 95% of NATO's nukes, and the largest army. Naturally so, because we're the largest country. But an alliance to protect other people AND ALSO contribute a higher % of GDP...is kinda ridiculous.

Furthermore, having Russia closer to us will mean more chances for close encounters in the air and in the Black Sea, and we all know how dangerous that is, because one small thing can turn into a big mess very fast.

Assuming they're able to fully invade the country with relatively few losses what next? As you said a full on occupation/annexation will take years if not decades to establish order. Setting up a Pro-Russian puppet government will still require heavy investment of forces to quell dissent and put down inevitable insurrections. 

I could potentially see an invasion as a means to force the current government to accept Russian annexation of the ethnically Russian Eastern provinces but then the remaining Ukrainian rump state will have lost its Pro-Russian counterweight and they'll be left with an even more hostile Pro-NATO nation on their borders.

I recall reading back when the initial contested election happened that one of the reasons Ukraine was never seriously considered for closer military ties by NATO nations was that the population was, while beginning to lean westward, fairly evenly split between looking toward Russia or Western Europe/US to develop closer ties with. Such division could potentially lead to a NATO aligned Ukraine suddenly switching ties back to Russia due to diplomatic disagreements and the loss of valuable intel to a geopolitical adversary, so it was generally considered that the status quo-a Ukraine with warm ties and some economic integration with the West but overall neutral-was the ideal situation.

It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

They don’t have to change public opinion, he would be making a decision that avert crises. 
They wouldn’t be a puppet state, they’d still be Ukraine. 

Why not just offer a plan, draw a line around the rebel controlled areas, and say okay you can have this crazy place, but you can’t cross these new border lines. No one wants to deal with those hot zones anyways, and a lot of the population there was already split on whether it should be Russia or Ukraine anyways. 

Then, Russia is happy since there is a buffer zone of countries between itself and NATO, and Ukraine is happy because there is no longer tension.

NATO wouldn’t be happy, because they lose their “land grab” which is pretty much Russia’s front door. Sovereignty and independence, whatever, NATO wasn’t supposed to expand and max out like it is. Ukraine would still be Ukraine. 

And the west shouldn’t be happy nor sad cause why do we even have any part in this, it’s literally something that’s been going on since like 800/900 AD between Russia and Ukraine. 

Sure, the lines on the map change, but who gives a fuck. Nobody needs to die over shit like that. 

Another solution I guess is if Ukraine and NATO can work better trade deals with Russia. That’s probably all anyone was concerned with to begin with, Russia probably feels like they’re being shafted when it comes to deals.

It’s right along the border of Russia and Russia still considers Ukraine to be more a part of them than they do NATO.

They see NATO expanding as entrenching, and sees NATO as taking something that they should be taking. NATO isn’t just some sort of peace alliance, shit was popping off back then between Warsaw Pact and NATO. So when NATO expands, it looks heavily military-related. 

A country can’t have border issues to join NATO, and Ukraine has had nothing but that for an eternity. So why all the hype and why “hold down” on trying to join something that just causes tension? Ukraine will still be sovereign regardless, and other countries can still get involved if shit goes south regardless.

Moving that kind of military hardware and personnel around isn't cheap, especially for a country with as low a GDP as Russia. There is a very serious, obvious, and active threat of invasion. Not to mention the fact that Putin is bending over backwards to find anything remotely resembling a pretext for invasion.

I was responding to someone who basically said ""Putin's best move would be to not invade now, then everyone would look like idiots"", and I was explaining why that made no sense.

And I'm totally with you on the support thing. I think Putin dramatically underestimated the international support Ukraine would gather. I really don't think he expected the rest of the world to really care, let alone be shocked and outraged.

Earlier today I heard a military analyst explaining that Putin's mindset is hard for most Western leaders to understand, because he literally doesn't care about things like the optics of having a bunch of body bags come back with dead Russian soldiers in them, or how civilian casualties will look. 

He seems to have genuinely expected some truly low-grade attempts at manufacturing a pretext to have been accepted internationally, and for the rest of the world to go ""Oh, sure, fair enough, go ahead then""

Question is, I suppose, what he does now that he realizes that the rest of the world isn't going to ignore this. Backing down and walking away doesn't seem like something in his vocabulary, and the sunk cost is already enormous. But on the other hand, pressing forwards with an invasion seems like a *terrible* idea on every level. I mean, aside from the obvious reasons, even just from a purely selfish perspective it's hard to see any benefit in it for Russia.

TBH, he seems kind of screwed to me. He can't back down, he can't push forward, and he can't stay put. He's already kind of screwed the pooch. Main thing is just how much damage he causes  and how many civilians he kills doing whatever the hell it is he's going to do, I suppose.",False,1645257757.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxjys8h,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Ukraine gave them up because giving them up was a precondition for both a small amount of direct aid and the larger economic benefits that came with joining the community of nations instead of being sanctioned as a rogue nuclear weapons state.

1) Russia absolutely feels vulnerable. You can see it in all of their actions and in their country's metrics. Distance mitigates the threat they feel from the West.

2).The US is undeniably threatening. Imagine if the roles were reversed and Russia had the largest military spending on the planet, a lethal intelligence community with tendrils the world over, dozens/hundreds of military bases on every continent, and was leader of a coalition including all of your nearby Latin American neighbors. Oh, and they had stationed nukes in Mexico, Cuba, and Bermuda.

Then, imagine that Russia intended to economically obliterate the US's economy by weaning the world off of whatever precious resource you were all exporting. Now, Russia is trying to court Canada into their sphere of influence.

Sure, it's a rough parallel. The point is to make you see this from the Russian perspective. We can all feel morally justified in supporting our current Western hegemony because we all personally benefit from it and we believe that being ruled over by corporations instead of authoritarian states is a superior form of governance.

3) This guy hit the nail on the head - Americans don't give a shit about Ukrainians or Poland. They're puppets at best. Taiwan is an even better example. Americans are happy to be racist against the Chinese but claim how tight they are with Taiwan - despite the cultures being enormously similar. I'd bet you most Americans couldn't even name more than 5 facts about Taiwan let alone their capital. Same with Ukraine and Poland. This false sense of angry righteousness isn't about feeling sorry for Ukrainians - Americans are just concerned about their standing in the world and how this will affect them!

Russia seems quite intent on continuing to leverage its military to achieve whatever its aims are with regard to Ukraine and that will be that. Not much NATO can do about it. Unfortunately Russia has also put itself in a position where its increasingly aggressive posture will incentivise the rest of its neighbors into seeking NATO membership. 

The great irony here is that without Russia posing a credible threat militarily to its neighbors NATO ceases to have a reason to exist. Its expansion under W was undoubtedly concerning to Russia but the alliance was showing signs of unraveling up until the situation in Ukraine escalated. Increasingly popular movements in the US and western European nations were openly calling into question the need for continuing to spend on military commitments seen as relics of the cold war, and the US in particular began to pivot strategically away from Europe to confront the increasing threat China poses to its interests in the Pacific.

If we give Putin the benefit of the doubt and assume stopping the expansion of NATO eastward was and remains the primary goal that changes things, but it also makes his foreign policy look completely irrational. Russia has quite a bit of leverage over most of Europe (i.e. most of NATO) without resorting to military means. It has access to massive reserves of natural resources which most European markets are hungry for. Most of the continent is completely dependent on Russian gas.

I hate WW2 comparisons, but I see parallels. History doesn’t quite repeat but it does rhyme. Hitler annexed Sudetenland, Putin annexed Crimea. Similar pretext, ethnic Germans being oppressed then, ethnic Russians in Donbas now. Chamberlain was a weak leader and tried to appease the Reich, he didn’t want to be dragged into a major war “just” to help Poland, but in the end the world saw the threat and came together to stop the metastasizing cancer. Obama didn’t want to be dragged into a major conflict in ‘14 and his weak resolve emboldened Putin to act as he does now. European affairs aren’t Martian or Jovian, they’re crucial, immediate and affect American interests immensely. I’m no big fan of Biden, but I’m encouraged by the strong support and actions he’s taking. No invasion would be a big foreign policy win and would bolster American hegemony. I agree that Putin might have miscalculated and is annoyed by the choices he’s got now. He might not have any other alternative anymore other than give the go ahead and fuck optics.

They dont have enough. Ill do the math again, lets take United States, 4 million square miles. A nuke affects an area of about 400 square miles. Russia has 2000 nukes. Thats 800,000 square miles affected if all of them launch, all of them hit target, all of them detonate (pretty much impossible, but we'll assume they do). so that takes out 20% of US soil. Thats zero nukes targeting UK, France, Germany and dozen + other nations where ~20% of US military is at. Include Canada's land into that equation and wiht just US and Canada you are down to 10% of area affected.

That land will be habitable again in under 100 years.

Use of nukes is just not feasable. If Russia took out 20% of US land with nukes it would be completely obliterated by everyone else, it's nukes capability would be taken away, it would be divided like Germany post WW2. It would be complete suicide.

This is why no one will use nukes. It just doesnt make any sense to do so. Putin wants to go into history books like Peter the Great, not like Hitler.

Also, people need to understand that nukes are of interest to the military not because of radiation, but because of the immediate destruction at detonation site. It is an effective way to destroy something. No bigger than  a city (15 mile radius or so). Radiation is sort of like a side effect.

>To conclude, the NATO intervention in Libya was extremely controversial due to its failure in outlining what the true objectives were. Although the intervention was framed under Responsibility to Protect, it is clear that regime change was the priority for NATO—though it does not follow from this that NATO failed to protect the Libyan population in its entirety. As discussed, it is unquestionable that NATO’s short-term priority was regime change (excluding the initial justification under Responsibility to Protect), and this was achieved.

""Joe's crackhead son"" is tabloid-level stuff. Proper discourse of world events does not refer to world leaders by their first names, or throw words like ""crackhead"" around.

I genuinely didn't see any coherent points being made in the parent comment. Can you explain their point to me because I genuinely don't know what it is. The Russian army are invading (or not invading? Putting that word in quotation marks implies the writer does not believe it to be true but that others claim it to be so) Ukraine because the son of the US President has business there?

As far as I'm aware, the part of Ukraine which Russia would enter first in the event of an invasion has been chosen due to geography rather than obscure links to Hunter Biden.

Could their point be that Putin is threatening to invade parts of Ukraine where the US President's son has business interests so as to guarantee a reaction from Joe Biden's government? I think that's supposed to be it? That's what I'll answer. 

First of all the burden of proof is there to show what kind of business Hunter Biden supposedly does in Ukraine. Are we saying that it is sufficiently important that his father would be able (or willing) to convince the different checks and balances of the USA's state apparatus to go to war over it? Military action is not a singular button pressed by one man. 

Next let's consider that the USA is not the only country reacting to this potential invasion. This is where a lot of US-centric geopolitical/conspiracy theories fall down. Why would Boris Johnson or Emmanuel Macron care what the son of the US President has in Ukraine? I can tell you that the UK and French governments have been central in talks with Russia over this issue, and I'm sure other European countries have been involved also.

I already mentioned the geography part, please explain that one. In my understanding, what is being touted is that Russia is looking to anex Ukraine in its entirety not simply a part of it. To do so they would attack from strategically beneficial angles. Ie the Eastern part of Ukraine. Can you prove that Hunter Biden's business interests (if they do exist) are being specifically targeted by Russia here at all, never mind them being the keystone to this whole affair?

That was far more than this thread warranted, but I want to see if you're able to produce anything to back up what the parent comment said. Hit me.",False,1645273540.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxkhrbm,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

It seems far more likely that they will do a small offensive and try to get more concessions out of everyone.

The aircraft, an Airbus A300, was destroyed and all 290 people on board were killed. The jet was hit while flying over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, along the flight's usual route, shortly after departing Bandar Abbas International Airport, the flight's stopover location. The incident occurred during the Iran–Iraq War, which had been continuing for nearly eight years.

On the US invasion of Iraq - the neoconservatives (Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney etc) had been agitating for conflict for a variety of reasons [this paper lays out a lot of it](https://www.e-ir.info/2014/06/14/the-neoconservative-influence-on-us-foreign-policy-and-the-2003-iraq-war/) but the gist is a desire to demonstrate American power, galvanize the US population behind American values against a common enemy, and to increase US influence in the middle east to deter strongmen like Saddam from trying to hold the world economically hostage.

The invasion of Afghanistan was truly about hunting those responsible for 9/11 and terrorists more broadly. There isn't a whole lot else to that war, Afghanistan is a brutal place to invade with extremely little benefit in doing so. That was really a war of necessity for American security.

On the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - it was designed as a defensive alliance to thwart further incursion of the Soviet Union into Europe. Remember that the USSR annexed large portions of Eastern Europe after WWII, half of Germany, and half of Berlin. This wasn't the choice of people in those areas, this was forced compliance by the Red Army - which at the end of WWII was the largest and most powerful land army the world has ever seen (and arguably still is). The rest of Europe could see the writing on the wall, and without the threat of American intervention there was nothing the countries of western Europe would be able to do to stop the Soviets of they decided to take over the whole continent. So NATO was formed for only countries in the *North Atlantic* to agree to mutual defense *for attacks in the North Atlantic*. So if Hong Kong (at the time part of the UK) was attacked by China in Asia it would not have triggered a response from NATO. The simple way to think of NATO is that is has three functions - first to keep the Americans in (Europe), to keep the Russians out (of Europe), and to keep the Germans down. For nearly a hundred years it has done exactly that and the west has seen growth and success like nothing humanity has ever seen.

Once the USSR fell, all of the rest of the Eastern European states that had been dominated by Russia were given their autonomy. Unfortunately, many Russian leaders of the day (and now Putin) see the entirety of the Soviet Union as really just Russia, and he wants it back for a variety of reasons. 

The first is defensive, as the geography of Russia is such that there really isn't any obstacles between their western border and Moscow. The member countries of the former USSR provide a very nice buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe. 

The second reason is pride, the USSR was a true world super power - Russia is an absolute shadow of the USSR. Without control over the USSR nuclear deterrent Russia would be essentially irrelevant as a world power, they have very little capacity to project power globally via their navy or air force. With the rise of China they're about to have a true superpower as a neighbor that will out class them in every conventional military sense. This is a position Russia hasn't been in for literally *centuries*.

The third reason is Putin himself. Russia is not a democracy, it's an oligarchy - a small number of people control the government and all major industries. Putin and the other oligarchs are among the richest humans on the planet, and they've gotten there by essentially robbing the country blind. If the Russian people ever figure that out and revolt there will be hell to pay, so Putin has to galvanize the people of Russia in nationalist fervor - China functions similarly ever since their shift from communism to their quasi-capitalist economic structure.",False,1645282470.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxkvldt,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Knowing that some of the biggest funders of USgovt are energy interests and defence contractors, it scares me when the US says war is imminent, because I feel like it’s genuinely impossible to say for sure, what is a credible threat, and what is a manufactured spectacle to maintain a status quo.

Putin is a very very dangerous totalitarian dictator who wields very large amounts of direct power in ways that are a terrifying threat to the world. I’m not trying to diminish that.

But just like when the US assured us all that Saddam had chemical weapons, I’m keeping my mind open to the idea that the US might just have a vested interest in this conflict escalating, and they might drive it to the outcome that suits.

Regardless none of us have any say or ability to change it, so I’m shouting into the void. But I’m not just going to assume that it is how media say it is.

- nations have the right to self-determination and it should be up to the Ukrainian people what the future is for their country, if the east wishes to secede and join Russia the way to go about that is democratically, other countries should have no say in this process

- Ukraine’s existence predates the Soviet Union, borders have changed over the years throughout the last few centuries but it does have a long history, that history is intertwined with the history of Russia which is one of the origins of Putin’s interests in Ukraine (one of many)

- I disagree that Putin’s aims stop at Eastern Ukraine quite strongly and that he’d respect western Ukraine’s right to self-determination - he won’t, there is almost no doubt he won’t and I can go into more detail of why I think that if needed. There are ideological reasons (which on their own are enough) but the geographical importance of western Ukraine is the cherry on the cake, the Carpathian Mountains which span along the border of Western Ukraine and run down through Romania are key as they form a solid land barrier that makes a land invasion much harder as currently Russia has an extremely long, flat border that is exposed to NATO and non-NATO countries which makes Russia vulnerable to attack, it’s why Russia has so many tanks. If they hold control to the land up to the Carpathian Mountains he shrinks that border that needs defending to just Poland’s eastern border. 

- This brings up another big problem for NATO as if Putin achieves this shrinking of the border he now only needs to close the [Suwalki Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania–Poland_border) (between the top of Russia-aligned Belarus and the Russian territory of Kaliningrad) which if closed would leave Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia encircled by Russian territory which is a crisis for NATO and perfect for Putin’s long-term aims.

> To the military planners of NATO, the border area is known as the Suwalki gap (named after the nearby town of Suwałki), because it represents a tough-to-defend flat narrow piece of land, a gap, that is between Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and that connects the NATO-member Baltic States to Poland and the rest of NATO.[12] In July 2016, two years after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the beginning of the War in Donbass, NATO's member states agreed at the 2016 Warsaw summit to forward NATO Enhanced Forward Presence. A 2017 NATO exercise was for the first time focused on defense of the gap from a possible Russian attack.

- Lessons learned from how Europe dealt with Hitler are ringing alarm bells about Putin because we know already that tyrants can’t be reasoned with, as Churchill said “you cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth” and Eastern Europe’s head is firmly in Putin’s mouth right now. What happens with Ukraine will have severe implications for a number of other NATO and non-NATO countries in the region and we’ve already seen intelligence leaks of Putin having plans (doesn’t mean he will execute them, just that he’s prepared for the situation) where an invasion of Ukraine continues into Moldova (also non-NATO)

This is the point of no-return where Putin can’t be given an inch easily because if he is he’ll take a mile

Edit: to add to the point about the comparison of Putin to Hitler and this crisis to 1938 the [Sudetenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland) is the exact same scenario as we’re talking about here with Putin and Eastern Ukraine - did giving up the Sudetenland stop Hitler?

Nobody is denying that the Russians ran a disinformation campaign with the intent of interfering in the election. The argument is that there's no evidence that their disinformation campaign was designed with the intent that it would result in the election of Trump, but rather, that the evidence points to them trying to undermine the cohesiveness of American society and make it more difficult for Clinton to govern. 

Also, Muller didn't need to prosecute Trump in order to prosecute anyone involved in a bribery scheme. Nobody was prosecuted because there was no criminal *quid pro quo*, proof that there was an arrangement to willfully trade something of value for an official political act by the President. 

If you believe that the Muller report contains such proof, then you need to actually cite from the report and explain how it indicates a clear violation of US code that can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, so we can discuss that.",False,1645294069.0,t3_svyjxm,t1_hxlpnzi,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

And all these folks need to do to avoid this is comply with a lawful and totally reasonable order to stop blocking roads. That belong to everyone.
