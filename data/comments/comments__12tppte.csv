Day 420-422 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were yet again mostly quiet here in the city, but as usual many towns that are near the frontline/border are still being shelled daily. They have been getting shelled more than usual after Russians started using their guided bombs in our region, I guess they are substituting their missiles with bombs now because actual missile launches are extremely rare now.

Well, at least Russians aslo bomb themselves with their new weapon, first they bombed Donetsk with it a couple of months ago, and now they bombed Belgorod as well. It was especially funny seeing it happen right after one of Russian milbloggers boasted in his telegram channel about their bombers going on a bombing run to Kharkiv, just for them to bomb Belgorod instead. After he understood what happened he promptly deleted his post, which was just hilarious.

It's pretty surprising that Russians actually admitted that they were the ones that bombed Belgorod, usually they just blame everything on us. Though for some reason today during a news broadcast they said that *they were actually eliminating extremists in Belgorod from close range,* which is such a hilariously stupid statement. So, they literally said that they dropped a 500-1500kg bomb on a couple of cars in the middle of a busy street in their own city to kill some extremists?

> Bakhmut 

> Western quarters are held by the Defense Forces. 

> The front line inside the city does not exactly run along right beside the railway tracks—there are sections where the enemy crossed (now on west side) a few days ago and is trying to develop that into success.  The main task there is to prevent the expansion of the occupiers' bridgehead. 

> The enemy is also trying to focus their attention on the flanks again, while at the same time powerfully attacking in the city. This is executed by introducing additional reserves into battle—which they do non-stop. Including, also, shooting from other areas. The situation is difficult on the flanks. The enemy is trying with all its might to break through Khromove and Ivanovske. They did have had some success at Khromove, but were later stopped. Near Ivanivske, there are more positional battles, although the enemy pressure is incredibly strong. Our fighters have stood firm and preventEd the enemy from carrying out their plans. 

> Regarding what will happen in case of losing positions at the railway Station—simple—the Defense Forces will continue to carry out the task of defending Bakhmut. There are streets, there are high-rise buildings. In general, there is somewhere and something to hold on to. In Bakhmut, nothing has been decided yet and the fighting continues. 

@myrosh_nykov

_______

> In the Bakhmut direction, the situation remains difficult tonight.

> In the city center, the Transit Hotel is currently under the control of Wagner; there are heavy battles for every meter of our land.

 >  The main tactics have changed, and it is very visible. Korsunsky Street [in south of city] has been standing for days, activity is minimal. The main attacks moved to the flanks, tactics as storming fortified areas, when the losses are several times greater.  Artillery  hits more often, and at this pace, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will hold the defense for a long time—that's why we have an advance in the area of ​​the O-0506 highway [NW, at Khromove].

> It is obvious that the losses they [Wagner] suffered were so great that their entire group was thrown into Bakhmut [inside the city], replacing the flanks with regular troops. Of course, storming the city and fortified districts in the face of so much is suicide. 

> Heavy fighting continues in the area of ​​the O-0506 highway, there are no changes from what happened earlier, during the day.

It's a complete mess, that guy is going to go to prison for 300 years. He was blindly sending info to randoms in DMs and publicly posting detailed assessments about troop movements, contents of weapons packages in real time including from where, identifying the agencies he was getting info from and how, and updates about imminent changes in Russian strategy:

>Some of the intelligence posted appeared to foretell battlefield developments. On March 27, 2022, he shared classified information about the Russian pullback from Kyiv, information he said he “found on an NSA site.”

>“Some ‘big’ news,” he wrote. “There may be a planned withdrawal of the troops west of Kiev, as in all of them.” Two days later, Russian officials announced they were pulling back from the Ukrainian capital.

Apparently he'd been doing it all year

>“I was very happy and willing and enthusiastic to have covered this event for the past year and share with all of you something that not many people get to see,” he wrote on March 19, before adding, “I’ve decided to stop with the updates.”

The discord was linked to a public youtube so anyone could join it unlike Thug Shaker Central. Is this old news?

Apparently his specific job gave him more access than most:

>In his posts, Airman Teixeira said his job gave him access to material that others could not see. “The job I have lets me get privilege’s above most intel guys,” he wrote.

>Airman Teixeira also claimed that he was actively combing classified computer networks for material on the Ukraine war. When one of the Discord users urged him not to abuse his access to classified intelligence, Teixeira replied: “too late.”

>At one point he offered to share information privately with members of the group living outside the United States. “DM me and I can tell you what I have,” he wrote.

>On another occasion, he wrote that he was able to access a site run by the National Security Agency, the U.S. spy agency that focuses on communications intercepted from computer networks, to look for updates on the war.

>He also claimed to have access to intelligence from U.S. partners. “I usually work with GCHQ people when I’m looking at foreign countries,” he told the chat group in September 2022, referring to Government Communications Headquarters, the British agency for intelligence, security and cyberaffairs.

One interesting point that I hadn't heard discussed that much is the importance of Russian speakers to this conflict. It's been well discussed that Russia is certainly not trying to protect Russian speakers but it hasn't been discussed as much that Russian speakers in Ukraine are a threat to the Kremlin. If Ukraine is able to become a successful pluralistic democracy with freedom of speech that is a big danger for Putin and his allies. Pro democracy people speaking their mind in Russian right next to Russia itself endangers the Kremlin's control over the Russian information space. If this nightmare is to be averted for the Kremlin they must either establish control over Ukraine's Russian speaking areas or they must drive a wedge so far between them that no one in Ukraine will make pro democracy statements in Russian again.

The Kremlin is scared of Ukraine not because Ukraine could attack Russia or because of ""right wing nationalists or any other BS. The Kremlin is scared because a successful democratic country that fights corruption and has a thriving independent mentality is a clear danger to a dictatorship runs on corruption.

Air traffic and control systems are not threatened and there are no changes in the route schedules, the agency assures. However, it is experiencing some technical difficulties, including failures in communication systems, and some airlines were forced to use an old system to control flights.  

The cyberattack began on Wednesday, a Eurocontrol spokesman said.

""The SOVA mobile optical-electronic complex allows us to detect the positions of  enemy artillery, which unmask themselves with a flash while firing. The complex includes a special video surveillance camera and a laptop with appropriate software. This complex makes it possible to continuously monitor the enemy and very accurately detect the positions of mortars firing at the Ukrainian military. Therefore, the work of the complex saves the lives of our defenders. Also, SOVA is very important when adjusting artillery fire in conditions of direct visibility of the target,"" said the Head of the Main Missile and Artillery and Unmanned Systems Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Serhiy Baranov.

We will probably never know what COVID did, but to be fair, to the Russian’s it wouldn’t have been a big deal compared to the health issues they already had in 2020.

When Russian tankies talk about having 30 million males between 16 and 60 they can throw at the war, keep in mind at least 1 in 3 will already have serious health issues.

It started around 2015-2016, with Brexit and the US election. Those two events really turned the idea of (Russian) misinformation and fake narratives ""mainstream"". In the aftermath of those events we slowly started learning about things like cambridge analytica, facebook&social media misinformation, dedicated campaigns of trolling.

This awareness went into hyperdrive during the covid lockdowns, where the general public was not only aware of misinformation spreading, but could actively follow it and see it happening in real time.

And i think the Russian invasion was the final straw, where the general public wasn't just aware, but the (US) inteligence services refuted the fake news talking points in real time, sometimes even before Russia was spreading them. And more in general countries knew how to respond to acquisitions of e.g. NATO aggression.

You could argue that this misinformation has been around forever - 9/11 truthers are a good older example - but i think the public today(or at least the majority that isn't completely falling for it) is much more aware of it happening, and better equiped to doubt e.g. russian narratives.",False,1682112543.0,t3_12tppte,t1_jh6pvwi,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

The uncomfortable truth is that the US just doesn’t have vast quantities of air defense that could be sent. In the event of a major war the US would rely on the Air Force to gain control of the skies and then to prevent the enemy from launching missiles or sorties. It’s also the same reason the US doesn’t have just gobs and gobs of artillery shells.

The war in Ukraine requires vastly more air defense and artillery than anything the US was prepared for. Russia also started the war with just incredibly vast amounts of cold war era stockpiles and has sent somewhere between 500,000-1,000,000 men into Ukraine.

That isn’t exactly ideal operating conditions for the F16. You can try to build up the infrastructure, but you would have to defend it and that means pulling GBAD from other sectors. Second, how many airframes are we sending? A couple of dozen? That probably isn’t going to be enough to make a significant difference. The air space is hostile enough that neither Air Force is really operating at full capacity. You’re talking about needing a large force in order to really change the tactical situation. Third, what are the Ukrainian options for C2? Are we going to send AWACS as well to maximize effectiveness? Fourth, what ROE restrictions are there going to be? There are Russian air bases and GBAD located on Russian soil. Those are going to be struck over the course of the conflict in order to make the airspace less hostile for the PSU. Is NATO comfortable with NATO trained pilots using NATO supplied airframes attacking Russian territory? I’m not sure it is. So, back to the million dollar question, is it feasible for Ukraine to make a very large investment in infrastructure/training/logistics to handle a large influx of Western airframes at this time that will be engaged in combat operations in Russian air space? I think it would be extraordinarily challenging for them do that. I think that politically that’s also a very hard sell. More likely we’re talking about a couple of dozen airframes at best that will be limited to Ukrainian air space. Is that worth it? Do the benefits outweigh the costs? I’m not sure it does. I think the argument of supplying Ukraine with more GBAD and long range munitions like GLSDBs is a much more cost effective and survivable solution than a couple of squadrons of fighters that will be expensive to maintain and quite possibly limited in effectiveness. Counterpoint to that is can those systems be supplied to Ukraine in a timely manner? I do think that if NATO can source some Saab Gripens that they would be a much more effective platform for Ukraine.

To shoot down Kinzhal, Iskander, and the missles on a more ballistic trajectory, they would need high end systems. It's a problem planes won't solve.

Also, it would appear there is still hesitation to provide western aircraft. Avoiding escalation would be my best guess why. Fighter jets remain a hot button issue to all parties.

After all, it's the wrong vehicle for the job - it was built to fight Soviet equipment and soldiers in the geography of Eastern Europe, but the Ukrainians want to fight Russian equipment and soldiers in the geography of Eastern Europe, completely different.

Not only that, but we can't reasonably expect them to support such a complex supply chain, only the US can do that, which is why they don't export the M1. Except to other globally elite militaries like Egypt (1,360 M1s), Iraq (321 M1s), Kuwait (218 M1s) and the Saudis (~450 M1s), but UA couldn't possibly hold a candle to these in terms of logistical capability. It's not like they've shown to be extremely crafty regarding logistics. Ukrainian mechanics have learned to service every single vehicle any NATO country has used in the past 50 years even if the manuals are in Danish or missing, but the M1 is just too hard. Only the supreme intellect and training of 18yo USAF mechanics that may have dropped out of their homeschooled HS in Bibletown, Bumfuck Nowhere, can comprehend the extremely arcane gas turbine drivetrain, which nobody uses except the Soviet/Russian/Ukrainian T80s.

It's also unrealistic to expect UA to be able to absorb unfamiliar western equipment into their armed forces, of course! After all, it's not like they've done just that by setting up a myriad of supply chains for all the outdated crap we're piling on them of every single different European design philosophy and configured in all these commonly known languages that aren't English. It'd be much harder for them to run a single supply chain for, say, the 3,700 M1s the US have in storage than to run seperate supply chains for Canadian Leo2A4s, Danish/NL Leo1A5 and Leo2A4s, Finnish Leo2R, German Leo2A6, Norwegian Leo2A4s, Polish Leo2A4s, Portuguese Leo2A6, Spanish Leo2A4(?)s and Swedish Strv122s. Along with French AMX-10, Slowakian M-55s, Polish PT-91s, UK Chally 2s, and German Leo1s.

Same reason why we the US just can't give/sell them the 2k Bradleys they have in storage. Much easier for UA to operate and organise a supply chain for only a handful of them, along with seperate supply chains for Swedish CV9040s, ex-Yugoslawian BVP M80As, Polish KTO Rosomaks, German Marders or US Strykers.

Which they basically don't sell to anyone apart from a few close friends. The M1A1 is a way older tank, that the US planned to keep as reserves.

Thing is, not all that long ago, Poland convinced the US to sell them slightly modified A2s. A step below the US version. About 250 of them, fairly significant volume. Manufactured new though, as much about keeping US tank factories going as anything. But the US just didn't have a plan to refurbish A1s, they were old reserves to be replaced as they aged out. Then this war kicked off, and the US military started at looking at ways to utilize their giant stockpile. Especially as it became obvious that Russia can't threaten NATO anytime soon, and none of those tanks will ever be used if they aren't sent to Europe. Russia simply can't start a huge war at this point, no way they can rebuild before those A1s are scrapped due to age.

So, a few weeks before they agreed to give 31 to Ukraine, they amended the deal with Poland. To give them 113 refurb A1s, this year. Much faster than the new A2s will arrived. Which suggests you're more correct than you know. Later this year, there will be 144 refurbished tanks in Poland, that aren't part of NATO frontline defenses, that Poland can do maintenance for, and Ukraine is being trained on. 31 have been promised to Ukraine. Who knows how many they could end up with...

Existing US tanks M1A2, with DU armor. These are the ones the US keeps on NATO bases in Europe, and gives to nobody but the UK (who helped develop the armor).

Non-existent M1A2 tanks without DU armor, the export version. These are made and sold directly, they're basically keeping the US production lines busy once they've made enough US only versions. The existing countries that have these aren't in NATO, for example Kuwait has a couple hundred. Providing these to Ukraine means manufacturing new ones from scratch, not giving them existing ones.

Existing old M1A1s, US reserves. These are older tanks that the US just keeps around in case of WWIII. Not expected to be used at all in most scenarios. These are gradually either converted to US type A2s, or scrapped. Before this war started, the US didn't have a plan in place to refurb these for export, as they are last ditch backup.

So, after the war started and it became obvious that the last ditch scenario just doesn't apply (Russia isn't powerful enough, fighting China wouldn't involve massive tank war), the US Army changed their minds about using the old A1s. However, they have had to create a refurb plan, from scratch.

Because 'refurbish' is probably the wrong term, they have to have US only components stripped out and replaced. Stuff the export version doesn't have. Like integrated data links to US aircraft, navigation, etc. The stuff that the US had never made modular because they hadn't planned to sell those tanks. And that's taking a bit to get done.

What's worse is that those same US facilities are also being called upon to ramp up existing orders. Poland for example is receiving 113 refurbs later this year, on top of the 250 new export version tanks they are supposed to get in 2025. And that's the underlying difficulty here, it's not that easy for America to replace everyone's tanks without compromising their own readiness.

If logistics are so hard, and objectively mid-tier-at-best militaries like Egypt, Iraq and the Saudis handle the logistics just fine, why shouldn't Ukraine? 

If the US think M1 supply chains can be set up across entire seas in entirely foreign and hostile territories, then why shouldn't they be able to be set up in a country that shares borders with 4 seperate NATO countries and excellent transport infrastructure right up to said borders?

If the M1 is too difficult to learn to operate and service, how come UA is doing just fine operating and servicing the most unholy kitchen sink of the last 50 years of NATO/Warsaw pact vehicles in all possible European special configurations any military has ever fielded?

If the M1's fuel upkeep is too high or specialized for ex-Soviet militaries in Eastern Europe, then why is Poland ordering hundreds? Surely, if the fuel can get to Poland, it can get to Ukraine? Surely, UA could run them on Diesel like Australia is. Surely the US could spare some of the literal tens of thousands of fuel trucks they operate? Surely, fuel trucks would be quicker to build or source from EU allies than the M1s, so they can't be the bottleneck?

If the M1 is too heavy or otherwise unfit for the terrain, then why is the heavier Leo2 not unfit? Why did the US build an MBT meant first and foremost to fight in Soviet terrain, if it can't fight in Soviet terrain?

If it takes way too long to build export versions or downarmor storage ones, then how can they crank out hundreds of export versions per year from scratch to countries that aren't called Ukraine?

TL;DR: None of these actually matter - if UA is asking for them, and they're the country that has demonstrated incredible logistical skill and craftiness, and is singlehandedly holding back the entire Russian military without a functioning navy or air force, why the hell do people here think they know better than UA what UA needs?",1682089100.0,1682088609.0,t3_12tppte,t1_jh5d2ar,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Australia have run their M1s with Diesel for close to 20 years now, works just fine.

The logistical problem cited by the U.S. isn't about getting the tanks into Ukraine.  It's about keeping a fleet of vehicles that consume somewhere between 4 and 8 liters/km of fuel per each (depending on terrain) running.  A single brigade of 87 tanks will consume roughly 100K liters of fuel per day, more in a day of heavy combat, and that doesn't count the IFV's, the APC's, the supply trucks, and all of the other support vehicles.

>It takes years to build up proper logistics

That's a truism, and surely it's easier to do this for 1 vehicle, rather than the kitchen sink we're giving UA instead? Just for western MBTs they have to figure out maintenance for Leo1, Leo2, Chally 2, AMX-10, M-55s, PT-91, is that easier?

>Most diesel engines are very similar. 

UA is able to train technicians to service T-80 turbines, UA technicians can work dark magic to somehow keep decades old MiGs airborne and T-64s fighting, they're clearly highly competent. If the US is able to train 18yos to service M1 turbines, together they could obviously figure out how to train UA mechanics on M1s. 

Besides, not like UA even needs to repair them themselves: They just need to learn to swap the modular engine units, and if it takes the arcane knowledge of US trained technicians to service them (again, Egypt/Iraq/Saudis manage..), ship them to the repair depot in Poland that's being built at the border.

Again, way less competent militaries than UA are managing. The fuel itself can make its way to Poland quickly since US M1s are meant to fight there ASAP if a NATO/RU war breaks out, so surely it can then also make the hop over the border.

The typical training length for an Abrams mechanic is 4 months just to get through the basics.  U.S. Army Abrams mechanics typically receive an additional year and a half to two years of training with their units before becoming fully qualified as a mechanic on the vehicle.

How many Ukrainian mechanics do you want to pull off the line, out of their units, in the midst of an active war, right now to start the clock on that process so that the UA can be ready to receive Abrams in a year or so vs. sending Leopards that UA diesel mechanics, who are already well trained on that type of engine, can cross-train on in a matter of a couple of weeks?

Adding on to you with a source.

Battery is estimated at $1.1Bil total, that's $400mil for system, $690mil for the missiles, and $10mil for the Keurig (jk).

>Each Patriot battery consists of a truck-mounted launching system with eight launchers that can hold up to four missile interceptors each, a ground radar, a control station and a generator. The Army said it currently has 16 Patriot battalions. A 2018 International Institute for Strategic Studies report found those battalions operate 50 batteries, which have more than 1,200 missile interceptors.

16 Battalions, 50 Batteries each = 800 batteries.

You can have infinite shells but ineffective artillery if you only have 5 guns, or one 20-year-old truck used to transport the shells. In that case, we’re in agreement of their shitty logistics. 

Whether it’s neutralizing Russian transport capabilities, destroying Russian guns, depleting Russian shells, or any combination, I’m arguing that the effectiveness of Russian artillery is currently a shadow of its former power last year (back in January, the US estimated Russian shelling was down 75%), and that is why it has only made comparably minor advances compared to last April and May, a point you seem to consistently ignore.",False,1682102245.0,t3_12tppte,t1_jh69q9l,,9,2,0,2,0,0,

This isn't an ""either/or"" proposition. Again, your perspective appears a bit uninformed.   
  
You really need to read the Congressional Research Service's report titled, ""[U.S. Security Assistance to Ukraine](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12040).""    
   
But just in case you won't, here's a rundown as of Feb23...   
>  From 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine,
through February 27, 2023, the United States has
committed about $34 billion in security assistance “to help
Ukraine preserve its territorial integrity, secure its borders,
and improve interoperability with NATO.”   
  
Which includes...  
  
* 38 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)
and ammunition;  
*  8 National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems
(NASAMS); 1 Patriot air defense battery; and other air
defense systems;  
* 31 M1 Abrams tanks, 45 T-72B tanks and 109 Bradley
infantry fighting vehicles;
* 300 M113 and 90 Stryker Armored Personnel Carriers;
* 1,600+ Stinger anti-aircraft systems;
* 8,500+ Javelin anti-armor systems and 54,000+ other
* anti-armor systems;
* 1,800+ Phoenix Ghost Tactical UAS, 700+ Switchblade
* Tactical UAS, and other UAS;
* 160 155 mm and 72 105 mm Howitzers and artillery;
* 30 120 mm mortar systems;
* Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems;
* 2,500+ Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, WireGuided (TOW) missiles, high-speed anti-radiation
* missiles (HARMs), and laser-guided rocket systems;
* 13,000+ grenade launchers and small arms;
* communications, radar, and intelligence equipment; and
* training, maintenance, and sustainment.    
   
  
This is no ""simple arms sale"" (as you put it - bordering on ludicrously patronizing). [This is crossing Russia's stated 'red lines.'](https://www.newsweek.com/red-lines-crossed-us-russia-ukraine-war-1781413) This is pushing the limits of what Russia would accept up to the point of no return: The use of nuclear weapons by any party. It's a calculated risk that, if wrong, would trigger the end of a whole bunch of shit we take for granted. It's not a ridiculous question to ask, given your outlandish demands... how many Ukrainian lives is that worth?  
  
Ukraine has survived thus far exactly because of the U.S.'s support, not despite it. I'm sorry if your armchair quarterbacking is offended that the U.S. isn't sending the most advanced versions of Abrams to a hot war against Russia. I'm sorry you're upset they aren't getting the M1A2 SEPv[X] you think will totally change the tide with immediate effects.

Besides, if training tankers to operate them is feasible ([22 weeks as the bare minimum for a US tanker](https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/career-match/ground-forces/tanks-machinery/19k-m1-armor-crewman.html), more than the 16 weeks you quote for a technician), training mechanics alongside to service them is as well. Since engine swaps are so easy, you could even have the servicing of those being done in PL. This is a non-argument.

>right now, sending Leopards, and supporting them with American Bradleys, is easily the simpler and better choice for the UA.

If there were enough Leo2s to fulfil their need entirely, yes. But there aren't. EU militaries don't have spares and there's less Leo2s in existence than M1s in US storage. Since we can spare only a small handful of modern MBTs, the bulk of our help is a kitchen sink of outdated, unreliable equipment with horrendous supply chains, for some of which spare parts have been out of production for decades. That doesn't at all sound like the simpler choice.

I'd also agree if the US actually sent a substantial number of Bradleys, but again, UA are getting a mere 100, that's roughly 5% of what the US has *in storage*, and 1.5% of the US total. That's less than 1/23rd of the amount of IFVs Russia has lost so far, *only counting visually confirmed kills*. In comparison, Germany has donated 40 Marder IFV to UA, and 40 to Greece to enable BMP donation - that's 20% of their active stock, the US equivalent would be 1,300 Bradleys. 100 is better than nothing, but compared to what the US could be doing, is a joke.",1682093582.0,1682093048.0,t3_12tppte,t1_jh5kqkz,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
